# Seattle Review of Books

This repository is a work in progress, and so please pardon the mess. When I get further along, I plan to clean it up and separate the content repository (which will be private, because it will contain unpublished content), and the custom Hugo Theme, which will be public, so that interested parties could help the site evolve through PRs. 

It's a migration of [seattlereviewofbooks.com](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com) from [Webhook.com](http://Webhook.com) to Hugo, with deployment through Netlify. 

I'm building a Hugo Theme from scratch in the `themes` folder. 

In `__python-json-app` is a reliable, but messy, python script to parse our current JSON and output TOML formatted markdown files.
