description = 'Through a series of lucid and engaging exercises, readers are invited to discover healthier and more effective digital practices\n\nFrom email to smart phones, and from social media to Google searches, digital technologies have transformed the way we learn, entertain ourselves, socialize, and work. Despite their usefulness, these technologies have often led to information overload, stress, and distraction. In recent years many of us have begun to look at the pluses and minuses of our online lives and to ask how we might more skillfully use the tools we\xe2\x80\x99ve developed.\n \nDavid M. Levy, who has lived his life between the \xe2\x80\x9cfast world\xe2\x80\x9d of high tech and the \xe2\x80\x9cslow world\xe2\x80\x9d of contemplation, offers a welcome guide to being more relaxed, attentive, and emotionally balanced, and more effective, while online. In a series of exercises carefully designed to help readers observe and reflect on their own use, Levy has readers watch themselves closely while emailing and while multitasking, and also to experiment with unplugging for a specified period. Never prescriptive, the book opens up new avenues for self-inquiry and will allow readers\xe2\x80\x94in the workplace, in the classroom, and in the privacy of their homes\xe2\x80\x94to make meaningful and powerful changes.'
