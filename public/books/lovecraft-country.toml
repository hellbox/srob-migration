description = 'The critically acclaimed cult novelist makes visceral the terrors of life in Jim Crow America and its lingering effects in this brilliant and wondrous work of the imagination that melds historical fiction, pulp noir, and Lovecraftian horror and fantasy. Chicago, 1954. When his father Montrose goes missing, 22-year-old Army veteran Atticus Turner embarks on a road trip to New England to find him, accompanied by his Uncle George\xe2\x80\x94publisher of The Safe Negro Travel Guide\xe2\x80\x94and his childhood friend Letitia. On their journey to the manor of Mr. Braithwhite\xe2\x80\x94heir to the estate that owned one of Atticus\xe2\x80\x99s ancestors\xe2\x80\x94they encounter both mundane terrors of white America and malevolent spirits that seem straight out of the weird tales George devours. At the manor, Atticus discovers his father in chains, held prisoner by a secret cabal named the Order of the Ancient Dawn\xe2\x80\x94led by Samuel Braithwhite and his son Caleb\xe2\x80\x94which has gathered to orchestrate a ritual that shockingly centers on Atticus. And his one hope of salvation may be the seed of his\xe2\x80\x94and the whole Turner clan\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94destruction. A chimerical blend of magic, power, hope, and freedom that stretches across time, touching diverse members of two black families, Lovecraft Country is a devastating kaleidoscopic portrait of racism\xe2\x80\x94the terrifying specter that continues to haunt us today.'
