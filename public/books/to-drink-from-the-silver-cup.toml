description = 'Anna Redsand was sixteen when she heard her mother say of two missionary women who\xe2\x80\x99d been discovered to be lovers, \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re living in sin. They should see a doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d She knew in that moment that she would have to leave the security and intimacy of family, church, and home\xe2\x80\x95the only world she had ever known. As that world faded, so too did everything that had been religious or spiritual inside her. The journey was to find what she\xe2\x80\x99d lost\xe2\x80\x95or replace it. Was there a faith community that could accept Anna as a lesbian, a doubter, and someone committed to social justice?\n\nTo Drink From the Silver Cup is the story of Anna Redsand\xe2\x80\x99s quest. It took her from a devout missionary life in the Navajo Nation into the shame and exile of being unwanted in the homeland, and then beyond through the uncharted territory of different religious, spiritual, and political directions. Always striving for authenticity, continuing to long for home, forty years after taking leave, Anna embarked on a deliberate experiment to see if return was possible\xe2\x80\x95or whether too much had changed in her and too little in the church. \n\nIn the past, most memoirs about conflicts between fundamentalist Christianity and sexuality have been written by gay men. Few, if any, have come to the same resolution that To Drink From the Silver Cup does. This is a unique and memorable story with resonance for both seekers and those who have never challenged their held beliefs.'
