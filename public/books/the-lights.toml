description = '"I was taken most seriously when listening to men listen to themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Leda Galvan, a gifted writer who can also occasionally be given to self-destruction, gets in to the school of her dreams and sets out to make a new life in Austin, she soon discovers that the heaviest baggage cannot always be left behind.\n\nFunny, smart, and self-aware, The Lights is also a philosophical inquiry into the nature of how we connect in our most intimate bonds, sure to please fans of both Emma Straub and Eric Rohmer. As Leda and the men in her orbit grapple with sex, betrayal, honesty, and each other, their own closely-held ideas of who they are in matters of love and art give way to transformative decisions and the revelation of what comes next.'
