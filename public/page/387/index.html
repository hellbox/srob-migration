          [Man, weeping](http://aeon.co/magazine/society/is-there-anything-wrong-with-men-who-cry/) Sandra Newman | Twitter&rdquo;) &mdash; who is the funniest person on Twitter, and an amazing writer to boot &mdash; looks at the history of male tears.
So where did all the male tears go? The truth is, we don’t know for certain. There was no anti-crying movement. No treatises were written against men’s tears, and no leaders of church or state introduced measures to discourage them. Their decline occurred so slowly and quietly that no one seems to have noticed it happening.

          Today is the 14th anniversary of the 9&frasl;11 attacks. This morning, a Facebook user shared this Warren Ellis fan forum thread from the day of the attacks. Reading through it, I realized I&rsquo;d forgotten so many details from that day: the confusion, the fear, the hope, the hatred, the ugliness.
In this one thread on a comic writer&rsquo;s forum, you can watch America turn itself upside down and rip itself apart.

          All writing advice is expendable. It is necessarily incomplete and reflects the advice-giver’s biases and preferences. Such advice can certainly be useful, but it offers only one version of what writing can be. This holds true for Mary Karr’s new book The Art of Memoir, an introduction to her theories about the genre, a compendium of suggestions for writing, and a close look at some of her favorite examples. The beguiling tone and the witty, lively style from her successful memoirs The Liars’ Club, _Cherry, and Lit are on full display in this new book.

          Over at the Seattle Times, Mary Ann Gwinn has the exclusive story on this year&rsquo;s Washington State Book Awards finalists. You should click through for all the details, but here are some of the authors I&rsquo;m especially rooting for: Kim-An Lieberman was posthumously recognized for her second poetry collection, In Orbit. SRoB contributor Kelli Russell Agodon is a finalist in the poetry category as well. Peter Mountford is a finalist for his excellent second novel, The Dismal Science.
