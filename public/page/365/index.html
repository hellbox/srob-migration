          We think you&rsquo;ll really like his week&rsquo;s sponsor G.G. Silverman&rsquo;s work. It&rsquo;s funny, smart, and we think that after you look at two chapters on our sponsor page, you might even want your own copy. Those chapters will only be up through tomorrow, so go take a look today!
G.G. partnered with us as part of our drive to make internet advertising 100 percent less terrible. We ask that you look at our sponsors each week, and see if they speak to you.

          If you have gone, or can&rsquo;t go, to our recommended reading in Bellevue today, come tonight and see Johanna Sinisalo at Elliott Bay Bookstore! She&rsquo;ll be introduced by Lola Rogers, who just wrote about Sinisalo for us earlier this week.
Sinisalo is truly remarkable &mdash; a writer of the strange and wonderful. Modern spec fic fans will love her work, and her travelling to Seattle from her home in Finland is a rare occasion worth celebrating.

          Seattle poet (and Seattle Review of Books contributor) Anastacia Renee Tolbert read as part of the Furnace Reading Series at Hollow Earth Radio earlier this month. She told a story featuring the city of Seattle as a protagonist. Now that reading is available online for free. If you&rsquo;ve only ever experienced Tolbert&rsquo;s writing in print form, you&rsquo;re in for a real treat; her spoken word performances are absolutely riveting, and she can turn a room into a party, or a funeral, or church, just with just a few well-placed syllables.

          Yesterday, Slate published this amazing interactive annotated edition of Bartleby, the Scrivener. I&rsquo;m not a fan of all of Melville&rsquo;s writing, but Bartleby becomes more relevant with each passing year. It&rsquo;s a powerful American myth, and when viewed from another angle it can be read as kind of a forerunner to Office Space and The Office and other comedies about the drudgery of middle management.

If you began your Lit Crawl last night at the reading sponsored by Seattle-based literary magazine The James Franco Review, the first thing you heard was a poem by Lena Khalaf Tuffaha that includes this line: “Here, our senses are overwhelmed.” That’s about the most appropriate invocation the evening could’ve asked for.
Lit Crawl is an event that is by definition overwhelming. You’re given way too many options to choose from— almost a hundred readers, spread all over Capitol and First Hill — and audiences spend the night chasing readings around town.
