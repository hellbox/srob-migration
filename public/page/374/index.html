          Did you make it to the Seattle Antiquarian Bookfair yesterday? If not, head on down today! They&rsquo;ll be open through 4pm today. Go see rare book and ephemera dealers from around the country, and even from overseas. Lots of amazing finds for book lovers, collectors, and even for looky-loos.
Our thanks to them for their sponsorship over the past three weeks. Partnering with events like this is exactly why we&rsquo;re so excited about our sponsorship model.

          [What To Do If Your Workplace Is Too White](http://transom.org/2015/stephanie-foo/) A manifesto by This American Life&rsquo;s Stephanie Foo that tackles excuses for lack of diversity in public radio, and how, exactly, to address it.
There’s a question I’ve heard a lot lately. Program directors and hosts approach me at radio events more and more often (it’s not hard to spot me — I’m often one of the only People of Color [POC] in the room) and ask, “How do I reach a more diverse audience?

Consider two different jobs: in the first one, you sit in a room all by yourself at a computer and make up people, places, and events for months — more likely years — at a time. You push those imaginary people around in your head and try to coax a narrative out of them. You work on the same sentences over and over until you decide they’re as close to perfect as you can make them, or until a deadline rolls over you and you have to give them up.

        <div class="content">
          Cartoonist J.R. Williams is reporting on Facebook that Northwestern autobiographical comics writer Dennis Eichhorn has passed away:
Aw, crap. Denny's gone. His wife Jane called to tell me that he passed away this morning. She suggested I put out the word. He was a great friend, and I'm sure gonna miss him. Williams and Eichhorn were frequent collaborators, perhaps most notably on The Legend of Wild Man Fischer.
Eichhorn&rsquo;s Real Stuff comics are wonderful examples of autobiographical comics, true examples of how good the collaboration between writer and artist can be.
