End Pain Forever Steven Pete feels no pain. Even broken bones bring only a slight discomfort. For Pam Costa, any warmth burns like fire; she takes morphine every morning and sleeps on ice-cold pillows.

          After the 2008 and 2012 elections, I was very much enthralled by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin&rsquo;s quick-published insidery accounts of the presidential campaigns. Game Change and Game Change: Double Down both piqued my interest with their gossipy tone and their inside-baseball chattiness.
Now, of course, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that Mark Halperin is an awful person, and an even worse journalist; he sucked up to Donald Trump at just about every opportunity during the 2016 elections.

We wish we had better news to share this morning, but sadly we were the victim of a smash and grab robbery early this morning. Fortunately we have a glass company already working on it and the door should be fixed with no expected interruption to store hours or events today. The store reported on Twitter that their door has already been fixed.

Dear Cienna,
My local bookstore is great, except for one thing: the attached café is terrible. I fantasize about buying a new book and demolishing a few chapters over a nice sandwich and a cup of coffee.

**Monday April 24th: *Breaking the Bond* Reading**
The very fine Texas playwright Rupert Reyes brings a staged reading from his latest work-in-progress play, *Breaking the Bond*, to the U District’s own Jack Straw Gallery. Featuring local Spanish-speaking readers, this play discusses topics of deportation, anchor babies, and national identity.

          This video from Seattle Public Library provides a neat, Mr. Rogers-like look into the path that a book — in this case the 2017 Seattle Reads selection The Turner House — travels through the system.    Speaking of librarians, I just want to make sure that you appreciate how librarians dragged Ivanka Trump for her all-talk &ldquo;support&rdquo; of public libraries at the same time that her dad is trying to defund them.

          Yesterday, I was planning to pick up the first issue of Secret Empire, the new Marvel Comics crossover. (Technically, it was issue #0; the first issue of Secret Empire — as in the issue marked &ldquo;#1&rdquo; — is due on May 3rd. If you&rsquo;re already confused, I apologize for what I&rsquo;m about to put you through.) Every once in a while I like a big superhero crossover if it&rsquo;s handled well, and I enjoyed Nick Spencer&rsquo;s run on Ant-Man a while ago.

          A dark photo of Thomas Frank describing our dark political present at Town Hall Seattle.
A post shared by The Seatttle Review of Books (@seattlereviewof) on Apr 18, 2017 at 7:55pm PDT
 
“I apologize for standing up so high,” Thomas Frank announced from behind the podium at Town Hall Seattle last night. He observed that the audience members who gathered by the stage to ask him questions were forced to gaze up at him, as though he was a wizened old man sitting at the peak of a mountain.
