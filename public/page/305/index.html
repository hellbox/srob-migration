          Remember the &ldquo;If All Seattle Read the Same Book&rdquo; program that Nancy Pearl started almost twenty years ago? Did you know it&rsquo;s still going on? It&rsquo;s true! Only a few years ago, Seattle Public Library changed the title of the program from Nancy Pearl&rsquo;s super-cool name to the much-less-compelling &ldquo;Seattle Reads.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s still basically the same idea: SPL has a ton of copies of one book, and the author appears at library branches all around town to talk about the book.

          We&rsquo;re thrilled to have Kelley Eskridge back as a sponsor this week. Her fantastic book Solitaire has been turned into a feature film, titled Otherlife. That means it&rsquo;s time to read the book before the film arrives into the world. Read the entire first chapter on ours sponsors page. Also, check out Kelley&rsquo;s writing about what it was like to write this film based on her book.
If you&rsquo;re a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, take a look at our open dates.

          It&rsquo;s gauche, I know, for a reviewer to ask a favor of his readers. In 2016, a book critic should be happy to be read at all. But I’m going to ask something of you, regardless — and hopefully you’ll get something out of this, too, besides the glow of internal warmth that comes from knowing that you indulged the whims of a tired old book reviewer. My request is this: print this review out.

          MONDAY Kick your week off right, with the very first “Ask the Oracle” event at the Sorrento Hotel. This is a new fortune-telling themed reading series from the Hugo House, and it’s got a great gimmick: audience members anonymously ask questions about their futures. The authors find answers to those questions in their books. Hugo House supplied a sample Q&amp;A in the promotional materials:
**Question**: Should I move to a new city soon?

 "The great tradition of black art, generally," he started again, "is the ability — unlike American art in general — to tell the truth. Because it was formed around the great American poison, the thing that poisoned American consciousness and behavior: racism.

          The headline of this post is the motto of Editions at Play, a new digital bookstore teamup between London publisher Visual Editions and Google. According to Emiko Jozuka at Motherboard, the digital books are crosses between books, movies, and video games.
“We wanted to think about what we could do online that we couldn’t do in print. How could we make books that still feel bookish—so they are books that you would read— but that you could experience as well given they are visual,” Anna Gerber, the co-creative director for Editions at Play, told me over the phone.

        <div class="content">
          Cecilia Woloch, whose most recent poetry collection was from Washington publisher Two Sylvias Press, has a wonderful poem in the New York Times today. &ldquo;Wild Common Prayer&rdquo; is a poem with long, luxurious lines about an encounter with a familiar friend in uncertain territory. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a lunchtime investigation.
