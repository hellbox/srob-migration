        <div class="content">
          A month ago, I referred to the first issue of Heartthrob as “a very promising ghost story/heist comic.” At the time I was giving it a cursory mention as one of a fleet of new heist-themed comics. Now that the second issue of Heartthrob is out in comic shops, I can tell you that it doesn’t deserve to be shoved off into laundry list of trends. This is already shaping up to be a terrific comic book.

          Last year, the Seattle Public Library and Seattle Arts and Lectures teamed up to promote a popular Summer Book Bingo program. It was such a success — my social media was at times overwhelmed with #BookBingoNW hashtags — that they&rsquo;re doing it again. This year&rsquo;s PDF bingo card includes categories like &ldquo;Local author,&rdquo; &ldquo;#WeNeedDiverseBooks,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Recommended by a librarian.&rdquo; If you black out the whole card, you&rsquo;ll be entered to win a library of books from Seattle Arts and Lectures along with tickets to the 2016-2017 season.

        <div class="content">
          Right now, the internet is exploding with spoilers from Marvel and DC Comics. Which is weird. People seem to be getting genuinely upset over some of these plot twists, and they don&rsquo;t seem to understand that this kind of media feeding frenzy has been going on since at least the late 90s, when Superman died for the first time. Look, it&rsquo;s great to see people get excited about comics — I write a column about comics every week — but we don&rsquo;t need to harangue creators or write very long thinkpieces in response to what is obviously a plot twist in an ongoing story.

Geoff Dyer writes nimbly about difficult concepts that are exceptionally difficult for most writers to explain; he once wrote a book about not writing a book about D.H. Lawrence. *White Sands* is about travel, and the idea of travel, and living in the world; I can’t explain it, but I know Dyer can.

Tonight, Lindy West reads from her memoir Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman at Town Hall Seattle, and it’s kind of a triumphant homecoming after the first leg of what looks to be a long book tour: she’s debuted the book in Chicago and in Brooklyn but she hasn’t yet read to a hometown crowd.
When she sat down with me for an interview, I asked Lindy something I’ve been meaning to ask for a very long time: there was a point when she and i worked together at The Stranger when she was becoming a nationally famous feminist cultural critic.

        <div class="content">
          I sent an email to Eric Reynolds, the associate publisher at Seattle&rsquo;s Fantagraphics Books, to ask about how his company dealt with the so-called &ldquo;Netflix of Comics,&rdquo; Amazon&rsquo;s Comixology Unlimited program. Did they alert their creators about the program before it was announced? Do those creators have the right to withdraw from the Unlimited program if they&rsquo;re unhappy with it? Here is Reynolds&rsquo; response in full:
I did not consult with individual creators, but as with all of our digital sales relationships (subscription or otherwise), I've made a point to enter into non-exclusive and non-binding contracts that allow us to remove any titles at a moment's notice from any platform, in the event that we as a company or an individual author decides they want no part of it (thus far, it's never happened).

This morning, when the Amazon-owned digital comics retailer Comixology announced their new Unlimited plan, the comics and tech media were rapturous. &ldquo;Say what you will about their effect on the print industry, digital comics have made buying [independent comics] easier,&rdquo; Birth.Movies.Death&rsquo;s Siddhant Adlakha wrote, &ldquo;especially outside North America. What’s more, it’s about to get a whole lot easier with this $5.99 a month subscription service, which includes, of course, a 30-day trial.

Rufi Thorpe gained accolades for her first book _[The Girls From Corona Del Mar](http://www.rufithorpe.com/#!cdm/c46c)_, which was long listed for both the 2014 International Dylan Thomas Prize, and the 2014 Flaherty-Dunnan First Novel Prize. Her latest book, _[Dear Fang, With Love](http://www.rufithorpe.com/#!blank/tf1kz)_, is being released today (we ran [our review yesterday](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/five-reviews-in-different-styles-of-rufi-thorpes-brilliant-new-novel/)). I talked to Thorpe over Skype from her home in California. (_Author photo by Nina Subin_)  You start the book with that great poem from Czes&lstrok;aw Mi&lstrok;osz.

that contain all of our questions: why are we here?
where do we go when we die? are we really so alone?
