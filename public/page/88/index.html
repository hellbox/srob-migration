        <div class="content">
          It was a loss that felt like the fluttering turn of a page. When Seattle-area poet Joan Swift passed away back in March, friends and fans expressed their grief in many ways. They shared stories about Swift’s generosity of spirit, her candor as an artist, and her tireless devotion to the craft. But the most common sentiment, the one shared by people who spent years with Swift in their lives and by people who had never once met her, was that Swift’s passing was a sad and significant moment in Seattle literary history, a loss of generational proportions.

          It&rsquo;s time again for GiveBIG, the one-day nonprofit fundraising event in which local charitable organizations batter your inbox in hopes of a donation. Many of these organizations rely on GiveBIG to raise a large portion of their annual funds, and lots of them have acquired additional matching funds to maximize your donation, so you really should consider donating if you can afford it.
Here is a list of local literary nonprofits that could use your support.

Read the first full chapter on our sponsor&rsquo;s page &mdash; we think you&rsquo;ll really enjoy it. Visit Portland in the near future, and learn all about survival in a high-rise condo during the apocalypse.

Free Comic Book Day seems to have been a success all over the city of Seattle. On Saturday, I walked a route stretching from Fremont through downtown and up to Capitol Hill, and every one of the five stores I stopped in was packed with customers. And these customers were people who likely never would&rsquo;ve felt comfortable in a Seattle comics shop in the mid-1990s: women, people of color, families with young children.

Cathy Malkasian’s fourth comic, *Eartha*, is a tense and gorgeous journey. Reading Malkasian’s comics is perhaps the closest equivalent to dreaming that you can experience while you’re awake. The comics feel raw and mysterious and unsettling and more than a little dangerous.
The titular character in *Eartha* is a naïve young woman who sets out to return dreams to her society. The book feels entirely set in the subconscious — a world in which people read four-word news blurbs printed on biscuits and then perform their emotions of distress about the news in public.
