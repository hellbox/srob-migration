        <div class="content">
          Paul Farhi at the Washington Post writes:
In his forthcoming book, “The Voyeur’s Motel,” acclaimed journalist and nonfiction author Gay Talese chronicles the bizarre story of Gerald Foos, who allegedly spied on guests at his Colorado motel from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s.
But Talese overlooked a key fact in his book: Foos sold the motel, located in Aurora, Colo., in 1980 and didn’t reacquire it until eight years later, according to local property records.

          A couple months ago, feminist humor site The Toast announced that they were closing down on July 1st. Today, it is July 1st and The Toast is, in fact, closing down. This morning, they ran a goodbye post from Hillary Clinton:
I know that today is the final day of The Toast, and I wanted to take a moment to reflect on what this space — and spaces like it — mean for women.

Octavia Butler would have turned 69 last week. Though she struggled to earn mainstream acceptance of her work early in her career, Butler is now considered one of the most influential and important Science Fiction writers of the late 20th century. She came up through the Clarion Workshop, where there is now a scholarship in her honor to support writers of color.

          This Jonkers infographic, &ldquo;Working Titles of Famous Novels,&rdquo; is an interesting study of what might have been. Would 1984 have been as popular as it has been if it retained its working title of The Last Man in Europe? I kind of doubt it. That said, some of the working titles are better: I&rsquo;ve always preferred Atlas Shrugged&rsquo;s working title because it better reflects Ayn Rand&rsquo;s on-the-nose aesthetics. A quick internet search reveals that people have been wondering after working title what-might-have-beens for years.

          So far as I know, Seattle&rsquo;s most beloved librarian/action-figure-model has never even publicly talked about a desire to write fiction. According to the announcement, Pearl&rsquo;s debut novel, George and Lizzie, is about a married couple that has&hellip;.
...radically different understandings of what love and marriage should be; he grew up in a warm and loving family in Tulsa, Oklahoma, his father an orthodontist, his mother a stay-at-home mom while she grew up as the only child of two famous psychologists who related to her more as an in-house experiment, than a child to love; it extends from their first meeting to more than a decade into their unlikely marriage.

          It&rsquo;s been three months since the first issue of the Ta-Nehisi Coates/Brian Stelfreeze Black Panther was published. You can tell that the series has become a runaway bestseller because it&rsquo;s the first monthly comic that local bookstores like University Book Store and Elliott Bay Book Company are carrying as they&rsquo;re released, rather than waiting for the hardcover graphic novel compilations to be published.
Yesterday, the third issue of Black Panther arrived in stores.
