          The only way out is not through (bone).
When in doubt, don’t just meat or martyr.
Before cutting off your hand to spite your captor, see if you can tip the jar. Sometimes, shoot it; when you do, aim for the gears.
If there aren’t any scissors, start a fire. If there’s room in the well, sardine.
Not every number is an incision, and not every rule is a law.

In the days after the election of Donald Trump, poet Erin Belieu called on Facebook for writers and readers to not give in to despair and to “actively help make the world we want to live in.” Her appeal quickly went viral, evolving into a series of nearly 80 coordinated readings around the world on Sunday January 15th. Those readings are the launch of an organization called [Writers Resist](http://www.writersresist.org/). I talked with the organizers of Seattle’s Town Hall event, journalist [Kristen Millares Young](https://kristenmyoung.

          How Albert Woodfox survived solitary One week after joining the Black Panthers, Alfred Woodfox was arrested for robbery. Implicated in the murder of a prison guard, he spent 41 years in solitary confinement, longer than any American in history. His story, documented by Rachel Aviv, is one of extraordinary strength of mind — and the willful persistence of independence despite unbelievable social and physical constraints.
 On February 19, 2016, his sixty-ninth birthday, Woodfox packed his belongings into garbage bags and put about a hundred letters in a cardboard box.

The Butterworth Building is haunted. Just ask anybody who works at Kells, the Irish pub in the basement of the building.
Opening in 1903, purpose built as a mortuary for the firm Butterworth &amp; Sons, it was likely the first building in the United States to provide full mortuary services under one roof.

Dear Cienna,
Some of my writer friends have gone off the deep end on Facebook, posting novel-length rants about the state of the country. It’s misplaced energy — they’re just dumping content into a void.

**Writers Resist: A Celebration of Free Speech**
It seems impossible that this week will bring both the annual celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Donald Trump’s inauguration. But here we are. To mentally prepare for the discord to come, why not attend this freedom-minded reading by writers from Bellingham (Robert Lashley) and Spokane (novelist Jess Walter, poet Tod Marshall) and Seattle (Elissa Washuta, Jane Wong, G.

          Unreality show Interviewers sometimes ask me which mode of science fiction is easier to write: Utopia or dystopia? Look around you, I answer. Dystopian fiction is basically mimetic (realistic) fiction. It’s way, way too sodding easy to depict a scenario so ubiquitous; I choose to get my jollies envisioning the Utopian coolness that could be.
Equality and perfection are two hallmarks of Utopias. Especially for members of non-dominant groups like myself &mdash; women, queers, racial minorities, etc.

        <div class="content">
          I&rsquo;m a Superman guy, not a Batman guy. Batman&rsquo;s fine — I&rsquo;ve read plenty of Batman comics over the years — but ultimately Batman is about arrested development: any Batman story is basically a story of an emotionally stunted rich dude. There&rsquo;s only so much emotional wallowing you can do before you fall into parody. (I feel similarly about Trent Reznor: you can do a couple albums about the hurt in your soul, but after you make a couple critically acclaimed best-selling records, maybe you can afford a little therapy?
