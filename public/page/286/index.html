          The (I guess NSFW, maybe?) photograph of the &ldquo;naked language mural&rdquo; by artist Vladimiro Lunardon up at The New Post-Literate is a thing of beauty. It&rsquo;s exactly what reading great literature feels like to me. Lunardon&rsquo;s art employs lots of writing-like imagery, and some of it is really quite beautiful.
 The great Roger Langridge has a new cartoon of &ldquo;Abandoned First Drafts&rdquo; up on his blog for your enjoyment.

        <div class="content">
          Poetry Northwest is one of Seattle&rsquo;s great treasures &mdash; a journal that&rsquo;s been publishing since 1959. We&rsquo;re thrilled to have them as a sponsor this week. Their upcoming issue &mdash; available the first week of April &mdash; is a must-read. Maybe don&rsquo;t judge it only by its cover, but that image by David Hytone is enough to get us excited. In fact, did you know that none other than Mark Tobey did their early cover art?

        <div class="content">
          Imagine a world in which booksellers can break into your home and steal back books that you bought from them. That, basically, is a reality with e-books. Chris Meadows wrote for TeleRead an account of how Barnes &amp; Noble &ldquo;stole&rdquo; the first e-book he ever bought. He even contacted Barnes &amp; Noble to complain, and they told him he could re-buy the e-book from them if he wanted. A couple days later, Barnes &amp; Noble did decide to give Meadows back the e-book that he purchased.

        <div class="content">
          All this month, I’ve been interviewing Seattle-area school librarians. They have, to a person, been delightful interviews: friendly, optimistic, and eager to talk about their work. Almost every one of them told me that they believe they have the best job in the world.
But they’ve also all talked about a problem that plagues every school librarian in Seattle. It’s a problem that is frankly unbelievable for a modern American city, especially one that considers itself to be as progressive as Seattle does.
