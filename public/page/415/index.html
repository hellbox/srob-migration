        <div class="content">
          It&rsquo;s not every day this kind of historical investigation happens, especially in a relatively new city like Seattle: Seattle Pacific University is home to 43 letters written by John Newton, the slave trader who eventually became an abolitionist. Newton is perhaps best known as the writer of the song &ldquo;Amazing Grace,&rdquo; which is one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Newton was &ldquo;part of &lsquo;a loose but extensive network of late-18th- and early-19th-century British evangelicals including William Wilberforce who corresponded and collaborated on the effort to abolish slavery throughout the Empire.

        <div class="content">
          The author of Ragtime has died. He was 84. The first Doctorow book I read was his 2004 novel The March, a story of Sherman&rsquo;s March which ended with a truly horrific scene that sticks with me to this day. I then went back to Ragtime and and Billy Bathgate. Historical fiction is so tough to get right, and Doctorow was a master at it; he never deluged you with details and look-at-my-research flourishes.

          The Seattle Review of Books is officially an endorser of the city&rsquo;s bid to become designated a UNESCO City of Literature. This is because we believe Seattle is a world-class book city, and the designation would allow us to share our art with other UNESCO Creative Cities around the world. Additionally, if we earned the designation, the city would establish an office to oversee the city&rsquo;s literary scene, which could create some exceptional opportunities for collaboration and community outreach.

          Back in 2008, Screenwriter Todd Alcott looked at a rather unique publishing oddity from the 1970s &mdash; a book-length marriage proposal to consumer advocate Ralph Nader. These days, we&rsquo;d call it stalking, but in those days the author Amy Devereaux, after her many letters went ignored, published her 165-page proposal (literally titled Ralph Nader Will You Marry Me?) in a form that can only be called &ldquo;epistolary plus&rdquo;. It contained letters, songs, stories, poems, and a musical play titled Passionate Purple to Ralph Nader, a musical play.

        <div class="content">
          Specificity is the key for understanding broader truths. It’s only when we really drill down on a subject that we uncover metaphors that apply to other situations. To a lazy thinker, a rock is just a rock. To a geologist, a rock is a gateway to understanding the world, a subject dense with hidden secrets that affect everything else on earth.
In her book We Should All Be Feminists, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie digs into the idea of feminism and she uncovers some realizations that simply should not be as surprising as they are:

          Individual tickets for Seattle Arts and Lectures&rsquo; 2015 and 2016 reading series are now available on their website. This is the best SAL season in years, featuring authors like Ta-Nehisi Coates, Emily St. John Mandel, Teju Cole, and Claudia Rankine. If you can&rsquo;t afford a full series pass, now is the time to stock up on tickets for the lectures you simply can&rsquo;t miss. The Coates and Cole readings, in particular, will likely sell out soon.
