One million people convened in downtown Seattle on a bright, freezing Tuesday &mdash; February 4, 2014 &mdash; to celebrate the Super Bowl win of the Seahawks.

          It has been, to say the least, a crazy week. Locally, everybody is running for mayor. Nationally, our president&rsquo;s brain seems to be degrading at an alarming rate. So let&rsquo;s end the week with a piece of unabashed good news and a pair of excellent poems by Seattle poets, okay? Be good to yourself — and the moms in your life — this weekend. Spend a few hours at a bookstore.

        <div class="content">
          Yesterday, I wrote that comics and cookbooks go together as perfectly as bread and butter. I also pointed out that no publisher has put together a truly great, comprehensive comics cookbook. In comments on Facebook, though, a few readers pointed out that there are some more comics recipes out there for you to enjoy.
Chris suggested Tyler Capps&rsquo;s weekly comic strip Cooking Comically. I hadn&rsquo;t heard of this one before. Capps uses a blend of photography and comics to lay out his recipes.

**Friday May 12th: *Love and Trouble* Reading**
Bainbridge memoirist Claire Dederer debuts her much-anticipated new book. Subtitled A Midlife Reckoning, *Love and Trouble* is about what happens when Dederer finds herself in an unexpected state of sexual reawakening. The book juxtaposes Dederer’s youth and her midlife into a single narrative, tied together through eroticism.

          Every month, Nisi Shawl presents us with news and updates from her perch overlooking the world of science-fiction, fantasy, and horror. You can also look through the [archives of the column](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-future-alternative-past).
Wednesday, May 3 &mdash; last night as I begin to write this &mdash; Annie Proulx gave a talk to the University of Washington’s librarians about global deforestation. It’s the topic of her most recent novel, Barkskins, a non-genre account of lumbering’s three hundred years of greed and waste.

        <div class="content">
          This book doesn’t exist, but it should. Imagine it: it’s a giant, full-color, hardcover affair — sturdy and substantial. The kind of book that forces a little grunt out of you when you pull it off the shelf. The kind of book that thuds onto a kitchen counter like an announcement, like a statement of purpose.
It’s a cookbook. But it’s not like any cookbook that you’ve ever seen before. Once you flip it open, you’ll see why: it’s a comic book.
