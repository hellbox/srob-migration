          The Washington Center for the Book just announced their 2017 Seattle Reads title. From May 8th to 11th, Angela Flournoy will read from her debut novel The Turner House in locations around the city. SPL locations will carry plenty of copies of The Turner House in stock so you can take part. Here&rsquo;s their description of the book:

Angela Flournoy's multi-generational family drama focuses on the Turners, who have lived on Yarrow Street for over fifty years.

        <div class="content">
          Mary Ann Gwinn at the Seattle Times says that seven local booksellers from University Book Store, Third Place Books, Elliott Bay Book Company, Liberty Bay Books, Village Books, and Eagle Harbor Book Company have won &ldquo;bookseller bonuses&rdquo; from ridiculously wealthy author James Patterson.
 Well, here&rsquo;s a disgusting bit of year-end fuckery: Penguin Random House, the large publisher that formed when Penguin merged with Random House, &ldquo;has derecognised the National Union of Journalists and Unite for collective bargaining with its management,&rdquo; according to The Bookseller, which reports the move has left staff &ldquo;nervous.

        <div class="content">
          A little while ago, I wrote about a new phenomenon: books that seem completely different now that Donald Trump is president-elect of the United States. Over the weekend, I found another title to add to the ever-growing list.

I&rsquo;m sure when Daniel J. Levitin read in Seattle from his new book A Field Guide to Lies: Critical Thinking in the Information Age back in September, he probably seemed to have his finger on the pulse of the zeitgeist.

          In the saltwater aquarium at the pain clinic
lives a yellow tang
who chews the minutes in its cheeks
while we await our unguents and anesthesias.
The big gods offer us this little god
before the turning of the locks
in their Formica cabinets
in the rooms of our interrogation.
We have otherwise been offered magazines
with movie stars whose shininess
diminishes as the pages lose
their crispness as they turn.

This week, Sagging Meniscus Press is back to show their new book from Fay Webern: _The Button Thief of East 14th Street: Stories from a Life on the Lower East Side 1927-1957_. It's an captivating work that captures New York at a vital time, seen from the inside.
We have a full, long chapter on our sponsor’s page, but we&rsquo;re embedding a YouTube video here, as well, of Webern reading a short chapter called &ldquo;The Pretzel Lady at Union Square&rdquo;.

          “I’m bored of the early 21st,” our narrator Spens tells us at the beginning of Robert Dickson’s sci-fi thriller The Tourist. By “21st,” he means “century.” He’s a tour guide leading groups of time-traveling tourists on journeys through our mundane present — the travelers are horrified and fascinated by our shopping malls, for instance. Mostly, he sits and drinks coffee and eats pastry for the novelty of it (it&rsquo;s simultaneously tasteless and too sweet for his future-palate) while his group wanders around having innocuous interactions with 21st century residents.

  The election of Donald Trump confirmed everything I knew of my country and none of what I could accept. The idea that America would follow its first black president with Donald Trump accorded with its history.
