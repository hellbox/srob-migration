        <div class="content">
          (Every comics fan knows that Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country. Thursday Comics Hangover is a weekly column reviewing some of the new books that I pick up at Phoenix Comics, my friendly neighborhood comic book store.)
The single best ongoing comic book right now is clearly Brian K. Vauhgan and Fiona Staples’s Saga. No other comic comes close to matching *Saga*’s inventiveness, progressive attitudes, and sheer storytelling energy.

          I reviewed Ernest Cline&rsquo;s sci-fi novel Ready Player One on its release. I didn&rsquo;t like it. The book&rsquo;s boundless nostalgia for 80s nerd culture unsettled me on a deep level; hating the book kind of felt like self-loathing. In retrospect, I admit that my review of the book wasn&rsquo;t very good — I couldn&rsquo;t convey what I disliked about Ready Player One because I was wrestling with the issue of my generation&rsquo;s nostalgia on a personal level.

          The only downside to covering the books beat is that you occasionally have to write a goodbye to a fantastic local bookshop. Miguel Otárola at the Seattle Times did a fantastic job of paying tribute to Cinema Books on Roosevelt.

The Seattle Review of Books will launch our readings calendar in the fall. (These things take time to do right!) But until that happens, every Monday we’ll highlight the best readings/literary events/talks/book clubs happening in Seattle — one event for each day of the week. (The above photo is of local author Doug Nufer and his dog. Nufer is on the right.)
Monday: The week opens on a promising note as Seattle’s literary godmother, Nancy Pearl, appears in conversation with the novelist Mary Doria Russell at University Book Store.

        <div class="content">
          Is literature a conversation or a monologue? Is it possible that the majority of all conversations are just twinned monologues, skating by the ears of their intended targets and firing off into the void in opposite directions? Nearly everyone has been seated in a restaurant near an awkward first date where the conversation, despite both participants’ best efforts, ranges more toward masturbation than copulation. But what if that scenario is the norm, rather than an awkward rarity?

        <div class="content">
          A couple weeks ago, I visited the delightful Phinney Books for a reading. Customers at Phinney Books always have huge smiles plastered across their faces, and when you walk in, it&rsquo;s easy to understand why: from the categorization of books as either &ldquo;TRUE&rdquo; or &ldquo;MADE UP&rdquo; to the giant Ferris wheel along the wall of the kids&rsquo; section, the whole store seems designed to maximize happiness in humans.
In preparation for the store&rsquo;s upcoming one-year anniversary, owner Tom Nissley was talking up a neat new idea: he had recently purchased a Polaroid camera (or whatever they call cameras that take instant photos nowadays; Polaroid got out of the Polaroid business a few years ago) and he was taking photographs of Phinney Books customers holding their favorite books.

        <div class="content">
          This headline from Consumerist says it all: &ldquo;Amazon Will Reportedly Pay Self-Published E-Book Authors $.006 Per Page Read.&rdquo;
According to the *Guardian*, that means the payments received by authors could be as little as $0.006 per page read, estimating that if an author publishes a 220-page book each page would have to be read by every person who downloads the book in order for the writer to make the $1.30 they get under the previous pay-per-download payment system.
