          **Wednesday August 10: *Train to Bombay* **
In her native India, Jaina Sanga has published a novel and a book of short stories. Though Sanga writes in English, has lived in the US since 1980, and currently resides in Dallas, her books have never been published here. Elliott Bay has imported her books and is throwing one of her only US events here tonight, making this a unique moment in international literature.

          For decades, Peter Bagge has reigned as Seattle’s mightiest cartoonist. He’s a high-functioning artist, which is to say that his work is strong in just about any way an artist’s work can be measured: he’s prolific, he’s stylistically fascinating, his comics are easy to read and well-written, he has a unique viewpoint, and his work has deepened over time. Though he’s been publishing work for over three decades now, Bagge’s best work — a biography of Margaret Sanger titled Woman Rebel — was published in late 2013, and there’s no sign that he’s slowing down in terms of output and quality.

        <div class="content">
          James Alan McPherson, acclaimed American writer and writing educator, died last month, at the age of 72.
McPherson is best known for his wide-ranging 1977 short story collection Elbow Room, which won the Pulitzer Prize. He had worked with and been mentored by Ralph Ellison, an author with a similar eye for the entrenched, neurotic small-mindedness of the American cultural landscape. But McPherson&rsquo;s characters, navigating between situations of generous-minded realism and stark absurdity, are conveyed with a warmth that&rsquo;s unique to him &mdash; even when he&rsquo;s skewering someone, it&rsquo;s with affection.

I’m an insomniac, it’s a lifelong thing. And lesbian. I’m sick when I say this, a little envious of a body that can fit through anything, a lifelong thing, steady hands but a little shaky otherwise, getting hurt in everyday ways, we joke about it, I’m sensitive. Growing up together it’s years of tangled up arms or conversations and no one touches me as an on my own grown-up but for hugs and comings and goings or across my hair when I’ve just cut it, I’ve grown all arms and head.

        <div class="content">
          When I was a kid, I loved George R. R. Martin&rsquo;s superhero anthology fiction series Wild Cards. It&rsquo;s hard to get superheroes right in prose, but Martin&rsquo;s dark and involved universe just felt perfect. (The comics adaptation of the books, as I recall, was terrible.) If you&rsquo;re going on vacation later this month and you like sci-fi anthologies, grab a couple Wild Cards volumes before you go.
Well, now that Game of Thrones has taken over the universe, a Wild Cards TV series is in the works.

          Sponsor Isla McKetta spent a year in Poland, and it was that experience, and having spent a previous year in Pinochet&rsquo;s Chile as a child, that made oppression a topic in the forefront of her mind. In her novel Polska, 1994 she explores that, through the eyes of Magda, who witnesses her mother&rsquo;s arrest and disapearance.
We have a long sample on our sponsor&rsquo;s page so you can experience McKetta&rsquo;s tightly wrought language and ideas.

 In a galaxy far, far away&hellip; When I was growing up in rural Bedfordshire in the Eighties, there were fairly limited options for sci-fi action fans to get their fix. On TV, there were three &mdash; then four &mdash; channels that might show the odd Star Trek or Doctor Who episode.

While our August Bookstore of the Month, Secret Garden Books, does host plenty of events in its Ballard storefront, most of the events on its robust readings calendar can’t be attended by your average adult Seattleite. “What we do mostly with events is school visits,” Secret Garden’s events manager Suzanne Perry tells me. She calls the school events “one of my favorite parts” of the job, event though “we don’t publicize them and people don’t know we do them.
