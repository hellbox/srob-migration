          As I said yesterday, I am loving the newfound attention Colson Whitehead is receiving. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with Whitehead&rsquo;s work, this interview with Jennifer Schuessler of the New York Times is a great way to learn about him.
He mentioned a bookstore owner from the South who invited him to come down for “a frank talk about race.”
“I’m honored by the response to the novel, but I was like, ‘Can we just talk about the book?

          Jekeva Phillips is a force of nature. She’s a writer who also performs improv, and a couple years ago she created her own magazine, Word Lit Zine, from thin air. For her next trick, she’s devised her own three-day festival, Bibliophilia, which combines her love of theater and literature into a cross-disciplinary storytelling celebration.
Bibliophilia is made up of five events taking place on August 4th, 5th, and 6th at the Pocket Theater in Greenwood.

          I use a trick to teach students
how to avoid passive voice.
Circle the verbs.
Imagine inserting “by zombies”
after each one.
Have the words been claimed
by the flesh-hungry undead?
If so, passive voice.
I wonder if these
sixth graders will recollect,
on summer vacation,
as they stretch their legs
on the way home
from Yellowstone or Yosemite
and the byway’s historical marker
beckons them to the
site of an Indian village &mdash;

          Just last week, we told you that booksellers around Seattle were buzzing about Colson Whitehead&rsquo;s upcoming novel Underground Railroad.

Today, Oprah added her approval to the chorus of booksellers and librarians by adding the novel to her Oprah&rsquo;s Book Club label. &ldquo;The September issue of O, The Oprah Magazine (available Aug.
