        <div class="content">
          Busy day here, at the Seattle Review of Books. First, we published a piece by Laurel Holliday, Library Board scrambles for special meeting on rebranding issue; City Hall reacts, looking at the board&rsquo;s apparent cold-feet over the rebranding effort.
Then, we talked to the man behind the rebranding effort himself, City Librarian Marcellus Turner, and made sure that he had a chance to defend his work, in his own words (which, to our ears, read like little more than corporate-esque non-speak).

        <div class="content">
          President Fujiwara and the Seattle Public Library’s Board of Trustees,
As Laurel Holliday reported for the Seattle Review of Books last week, public response to Seattle Public Library’s proposed rebranding campaign has been overwhelmingly negative. In fact, Holliday reports the response has been so negative that the board appears likely to kill the rebranding plan at or before their public meeting on Wednesday.
This is for the best. The rebranding was ill-considered, and it was presented to the public in an arrogant, unprofessional way.

        <div class="content">
          We&rsquo;re sponsored this week by a very unique book, by a very unique Seattle writer. Esther Altshul Helfgott kept a journal full of insight and poetry, as Alzheimer&rsquo;s first showed its affects in her husband Abe. Her book Dear Alzheimer&rsquo;s is a startling, humane, and insightful look into a difficult time.
You may know Helfgott from her long standing (25 years!) writers reading series It&rsquo;s About Time, held every second Thursday at the Seattle Public Library&rsquo;s Ballard Branch.

        <div class="content">
          On Wednesday, October 21, I conducted an email interview with Marcellus Turner (interlocuted by SPL Communications Director Andra Addison), and I asked him three questions about the rebranding effort.
**Who first proposed rebranding SPL? Why did you come out so strongly in favor of rebranding rather than some other means of obtaining your ends?**
I know that once I arrived at The Seattle Public Library, I recognized some areas that needed review, our look and brand being one of them.

          _Update: 10:57am. Following the post is an email update from Seattle Public Library's Director of Communications, Andra Addison_.
The Seattle Public Library Board of Trustees appears to be responding proactively to the barrage of criticism the SPL rebranding initiative has received from patrons, the public, library donors, and the media over the course of the last month. Board members have called for a Special Meeting to vote on the rebranding initiative before their Wednesday, October 28th regularly scheduled meeting which has the branding initiative on the agenda.

          Today we&rsquo;re dedicating the Seattle Review of Books to the Seattle Public Library, and City Librarian Marcellus Turner&rsquo;s proposed re-branding. We even published Paul&rsquo;s normal Monday Week in Readings post last night, to keep our focus.
We&rsquo;re publishing three pieces today on the topic:
At 10:00am Laurel Holliday, who [previously covered the public response](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/21/public-response-to-spl-survey-sharply-against-city-librarian-marcellus-turners-rebranding-plan/ "The Seattle Review of Books - Public response to SPL survey sharply against City Librarian Marcellus Turner&#39;s rebranding plan"

          MONDAY Ada’s Technical Books kicks off our week in events with NASA scientist ** Les Johnson**, who will be discussing his book Harvesting Space for a Greener Earth&hellip;And Beyond! Press materials promise that Johnson will discuss “how we can use space resources to help solve energy and environmental problems on Earth while simultaneously putting in place the infrastructure to allow sustained exploration of Mars.” Now that you&rsquo;ve seen The Martian and you&rsquo;re all stressed about what would happen if you get trapped on Mars by yourself, you should probably start preparing for just that eventuality.

 Doug gets an unkind review. We are worried. Will one of us dopily bring it up in workshop? We don’t. Doug does. Right off the bat. He wants to talk about it, because he feels there might be something in it for us. The talk he gives us is beautiful, honest, courageous, totally generous.
