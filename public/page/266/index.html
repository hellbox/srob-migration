          The fifteenth annual Free Comic Book Day (FCBD) is this coming Saturday. If you‚Äôve never heard of FCBD before, that‚Äôs terrific ‚Äî you just identified yourself as FCBD‚Äôs target audience. It‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like: you can wander into your nearest comic book store (find the address at freecomicbookday.com) and walk out with a handful of free comic books, no strings attached.
Say you pick up some comics on FCBD, and you like them.

          This is supremely hard; I don&rsquo;t know how, exactly, I can in good conscience just select three literary nonprofits out of that long list of worthy organizations. But this year, I&rsquo;m choosing my nonprofits based on extraordinary need: these three organizations are about to enter times of great change, and so they could use your time and attention and money a little more than ever. In alphabetical order, they are:

          GiveBig is here! You&rsquo;ve already read Paul&rsquo;s overview on the day, with the list of books-and-literacy themed giving. But we thought personalized picks might help too.
So, here&rsquo;s where I think you can do the most good. My theme? Funding the education of writers you will be reading in the future. Also: watch for Paul&rsquo;s picks, coming at noon.

A looker, a loser, an up-on-his-lucker.
Someone looser, someone tighter,

wine-swiller, someone to entertain

Someone with handlers, another with baggage,

Different faces, symmetrical and un-.

Today is the sixth annual GiveBIG charitable giving event. The deal with GiveBIG is that for one day out of the year, the Seattle Foundation will stretch your donations to nonprofits with funds of their own. In their last five years, they&rsquo;ve given more than $56 million to Seattle-area nonprofits.
But how do you sift through the dozens of GiveBIG nonprofits to find the organizations who do the work that you&rsquo;re most passionate about?

          Sponsor Steve Toutonghi&rsquo;s debut Science Fiction Novel Join was just released, and you owe it to yourself to check out the first chapter on our sponsorship page.
Join is a mind-expanding story set in a world where multiple people can join into a single consciousness. The tale is rich, tense, and nuanced, and full of the mind-expanding ideas only possible in a good science fiction story. We&rsquo;re so grateful to Steve for his sponsorship, and urge you to take a look.

&mdash; Courtney (@seattlecourtney) May 1, 2016 I‚Äôm not from here. I arrived from New England, in 1993, a grunge-hating, coffee-agnostic seventeen-year-old. Hours in mosh pits covered in other people‚Äôs sweat and spit while gazing adoringly at Mark Arm taught me to love the music of this place; becoming a sleepless single mother taught me the joy in the local joe. A great deal of the rest of what I know ‚Äî about the Pacific Northwest and about life ‚Äî I learned from independent bookstores and the people who love them.

The top of Queen Anne, to me, often feels like an island. The rhythms are different up there than you‚Äôll find down on the streets of Seattle. It‚Äôs quieter, a little calmer. Maybe that‚Äôs why Queen Anne Book Company, our May Bookstore of the Month, feels a little bit like an island bookstore: it‚Äôs small, but it‚Äôs incredibly well-stocked for a store of its size. Bookstores on islands have to have a phenomenal collection of books, because they can‚Äôt rely on luxuries like next-day shipping or conveniently located book distributors the way mainland bookstores do.
