        <div class="content">
          The Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s Greg Bensinger quotes Sandeep Mathrani, a chief executive of a company that owns malls nationwide, as saying that Amazon could be opening as many as 400 brick-and-mortar stores in the US. It&rsquo;s just a rumor at this point, but it makes sense.
This, of course, is bad news for booksellers everywhere. University Book Store&rsquo;s manager Pam Cady recently admitted that the new Amazon Books in University Village has eaten into her store&rsquo;s profits, and other booksellers have expressed concern about Amazon Books opening near them.

          It would be an interesting time to be a writer in residence at the Hugo House; you&rsquo;d be there during the transition period between the old House and the new. Why not apply? You can find details at the very bottom of this page.

          In 1860, Mrs. Elizabeth Packard had a conversation with a traveling sewing machine salesman. Her husband, a Calvinist minister named Theophilus Packard, was on her mind. Elizabeth had recently caused quite a ruckus when she stood up in the middle of one of her husband&rsquo;s sermons, and announced that she was crossing the street to the Presbyterian church, whose religious views aligned better with hers.
&ldquo;She found fault that Mr. Packard would not discuss their points of difference in religion in an open manly way instead of going around and denouncing her as crazy to her friends and to the church,&rdquo; the salesman later testified.

          Suppose it is February and there are writers writing at picnic tables in the park. Suppose writing leads us to this park. Suppose the rhythm of the afternoon sky courses through you, igniting relief and terror. Suppose you are hungry and light-headed while hoping to retrieve the faintest mark.
Suppose a writer has planted a score inside her mouth. Suppose the wind morphs that score into something fizzy and warm. Suppose everyone puts pens down at the same time.
