          I hope you&rsquo;re keeping up on the Phinney Books Resist List, a regularly updated list of civically minded books for sale through their website and in their store. Twenty percent of all Resist List sales will benefit the ACLU. This is the sort of thing that independent bookstores are great at, and it&rsquo;s another way to stay involved in a time when every day brings with it a series of new political horrors.

          If you&rsquo;re the kind of person who prefers to read series once they&rsquo;re through, you&rsquo;re in luck! Last week&rsquo;s series of pieces profiling new Seattle publisher Mount Analogue is over. You should read my interview with Mount Analogue publisher Colleen Louise Barry and my reviews of Mount Analogue&rsquo;s books: the erasure series now on display at Open Books, the terrific collection of poetry by Ted Powers, the amazing tone poem constructed solely from captioned screenshots of episodes of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, and the pamphlet series that reimagines the idea of magazines using an ancient form of political communication.

          I stepped down from the trolley that day in Hiroshima
and walked by the river where the children had floated in flames,
but I could not hear their cries of misu, misu. Lost.
I saw the rowboats tied to the shore waiting for the living,
and the Prefecture building as the autumn wind
blew through the skeletal dome and every leaf lay scattered.
I passed by heaps of flowers and burning candles

        <div class="content">
          I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I feel as though this year&rsquo;s list of Pulitzer Prize winners is a perfect representation of the year&rsquo;s work. David Fahrenthold of the Washington Post did excellent work dogging Donald Trump all year long. Oakland&rsquo;s East Bay Times is a great paper that never gets recognized for its excellent work.
And the book choices are exactly as they should be. Colson Whitehead&rsquo;s brilliant novel The Underground Railroad absolutely deserved to win the prize.

Northwest writer Jeffrey Warren &mdash; a long time Seattle resident &mdash; set his latest book _Justifiable Homicide_ largely in the city, amongst our high-tech firms. It covers investigative reporting, drug rings, computer _wunderkinds_, and most notably: encryption. A subject Warren knows well: he's an entrepreneur and engineer.
We&rsquo;ve run the full first chapter from Justifiable Homicide on our Sponsor&rsquo;s page. If you like gripping thrillers, we think you&rsquo;ll like what you find there.

          If you, like tens of thousands of others, loved Elisa Chavez&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; when it appeared on the Seattle Review of Books in January, you should know that a broadside of the poem is now available on Etsy. It costs $35, and all proceeds benefit the International Rescue Committee. It looks absolutely gorgeous, too.

        <div class="content">
          Grab Back Comics is a site that collects and publishes comics about sexual assault, harassment, advocacy, and consent education. It’s produced, edited, written, and curated by a Seattle cartoonist who uses the pseudonym “Erma Blood.” In person, Blood is thoughtful and eloquent. When the conversation turns to abuse stories, she’s always quick to turn the focus to survivors — what they need, what they feel, how to help. In less than an hour, the immense reserves of compassion and consideration she’s poured into the topic becomes apparent.

When Pat Buchanan Tried to Make America Great Again This piece by Sam Tanenhaus is a vivid history of Nixon&#8217;s 1968 presidential campaign, with direct lines via Pat Buchanan to Donald Trump&#8217;s victory last year.
