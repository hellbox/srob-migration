 Women’s news was the opposite of important, with close ties to so-called yellow journalism. Joseph Pulitzer is credited with developing women’s news largely as a means of attracting new readers and, in turn, new advertisers. When Pulitzer bought the New York _World_ in 1883, the paper had already had a “woman’s news” (as they called it) department for over twenty years.

&mdash; Elliott Bay Book Co. (@ElliottBayBooks) January 8, 2016 This is not Clinton&rsquo;s first visit to Elliott Bay, though it is quite possibly his first since the store moved to Capitol Hill in 2010. Clinton visited Elliott Bay in Pioneer Square at least once while he was sitting president, and he did at least one signing there, for his (incredibly dull) memoir My Life.

          On Monday of this week, a video went viral. If you’ve been on the internet at all, you probably saw it in one iteration or another, be it .gif or Vine or remixed music video: a raccoon is slavering over a brick of cotton candy. Being a raccoon, it goes to wash the cotton candy in a nearby pool of water. Being cotton candy, the block disintegrates as soon as the raccoon dips it in the water.

        <div class="content">
          Each week in 2016 we are going to invest $20 in a Kickstarter project. On Saturdays, starting tomorrow January 9, we&rsquo;ll be reporting on the Kickstarter we back, and how the fund is going.
That gives us 52 Saturdays in 2016, so the fund is 52 x $20, or $1040. If a Kickstarter we back fails, we&rsquo;ll put that $20 into another project, allowing us to increase our pledges if we deem a project worthy.

        <div class="content">
          This afternoon, the APRIL Festival (it stands for Authors, Publishers, and Readers of Independent Literature) announced the schedule for their fifth annual celebration of small-press writing and reading, and it looks pretty goddamned spectacular. As previously announced, the writer-in-residence for this year’s APRIL is Jenny Zhang, a talented poet and wonderful essayist out of Brooklyn. Zhang’s star is on the rise, and her role as writer-in-residence will undoubtedly give the festival some national prominence.
