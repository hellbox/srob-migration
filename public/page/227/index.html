 The Private Eye Writers of America have announced the nominees for their annual awards, the Shamuses. Local nominees include J.A. Jance and Ingrid Thoft, who were both nominated in the &ldquo;Best Private Eye Novel&rdquo; category.
 Have you read the Neu Jorker, the spot-on New Yorker parody produced by comedy writers from The Onion, the Late Show with David Letterman, and more? It&rsquo;s eerie how good this magazine is, right down to the phony ads.

          In 2010 and early 2011, writer Brian Michael Bendis and his frequent collaborator, artist Alex Maleev, published the first five issues of a comic titled Scarlet. Bendis and Maleev have always been ideal collaborators: something about Bendis’s propensity for including too much Mamet-style dialogue on every page works well with Maleev’s photorealism, which often fails to convey action in any convincing way. Their comics — particularly their long run on Daredevil — tend to be wordy dramas that feel more like plays than the usual action movies you’ll find in superhero comics.

          Every Mary Roach book is crammed full of fascinating characters. In the course of her pop science investigations (Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers; Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife; Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex; Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void; and Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal) Roach often interviews the kind of obsessive minds who used to be referred to as “eccentrics.

Wednesday June 15: Grunt Reading
Perhaps you’ve read one or two of Mary Roach’s very funny investigations of weird everyday science (Stiff, about death and dying, was her debut; Bonk, about sex, was another high point). Her latest, Grunt, is about the science of war, and it promises more shocking, ridiculous, and downright disgusting revelations. I&rsquo;ll be joining Roach onstage for a Q&amp;A. Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.

“The pregnant girl enters the Trenton Family Clinic,” begins Tracy Barone’s debut novel Happy Family, “looking like she parted the Red Sea to get there. The lower half of her dress is wet with amniotic fluid, and the upper half is streaked with sweat.” This is a grand opening line for a novel, dense with imagery, evocative of the Bible, and thick with bodily fluids. It promises both legend and messy corporeality.

          We have an Instagram account! Let me utilize it here to extend some thanks.
Last Friday, Push/Pull Gallery and the Seattle Review of Books teamed up to host Christine Marie Larsen&rsquo;s opening at the Essential Natural Mattress store, in Belltown. Hanging on the wall, all around us, were the originals of the portraits she paints for us each week.
Also in attendence, were three readers who did us the honor of showing up, presenting some work, and then, posing with their portraits.
