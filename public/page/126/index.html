          Novels are terrific engines of social change. No form of art is as effective at putting you inside the minds of other people; to read a novel, you must be willing and welcoming to someone else’s perspectives. Being a receptive reader is a state of grace that you never experience in, say, politics. It’s a place of possibility, an opportunity to create change in yourself. Harriet Beecher Stowe understood this, and Charles Dickens, and Harper Lee.

        <div class="content">
          James Baldwin is at the center of the new documentary I Am Not Your Negro, but it’s not a biography. Instead, it’s an essay about the history of race in America composed posthumously from Baldwin’s notes. Baldwin is at the center of the film; it’s constructed around his narration (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) and his televised appearances serve as supplementary arguments. He shares his own story, but he only uses it as an example of the larger African-American experience.

Oh mysterious benefactor, how I love thee... @Booksmith pic.twitter.com/TXi8alkYgO
&mdash; Christin Evans (@christinevans) February 3, 2017 From Michelle Robertson at the San Francisco Chronicle:
On Friday night, a "mysterious benefactor" purchased 50 copies of [*1984*] to be given away free at Booksmith in Haight-Ashbury.

          Even if the word “remainder” doesn’t mean anything to you, you likely have spent time browsing remaindered books. You can find remainders in most large bookstores—they’re the new-looking books that sell for used-book prices, often stacked on tables near the front door. They’re basically the second-run movie theaters of the publishing world—outdated overstock sold for dirt-cheap to distributors a year or more after the title first went on sale.
Remainders — also called bargain books — are big business for bookstores.

Here&rsquo;s her first report back about what she chose to carry, and why it meant something important to her. Can we just say it? She&rsquo;s one of our biggest inspirations in a time when we need inspirations so bad.
