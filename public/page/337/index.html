          Every day, friend of the SRoB Rahawa Haile tweets a short story. She gave us permission to collect them every week. She's archiving the entire project on Storify.
Rahawa also wrote this week [in the _Millions_](http://www.themillions.com/2015/12/a-year-in-reading-rahawa-haile.html) about her year in reading.

          Nancy Pearl at Town Hall is our official Sunday pick, but before you head there you should drop by Fantagraphics and say hey to Laura Knetzger, from 1-3pm. She&rsquo;s throwing a release party for Bug Boys.
Bug Boys is a compendium of the comic of the same name, and it is really marvelous. Head down for her official release party, pick up the book and give a local hard-working comic artist some love and sales.

        <div class="content">
          Awesome Seattle cartoonist Ellen Forney&rsquo;s giant portraits of hands have finally been installed at the Capitol Hill light rail station, which is (and I am pants-wettingly excited about this) set to open early next year. Tonight at 5 pm, Forney will be on hand at the station as part of the Capitol Hill Art Walk to sort-of christen the new artwork with hot beverages and a public party. If you&rsquo;re a Forney fan — as everyone who&rsquo;s read Marbles or I Love Led Zeppelin undoubtedly is — you should show up for this one.

        <div class="content">
          I&rsquo;ve said many times that I&rsquo;m not fond of year-end best-of book lists. Year-end lists, so far as I&rsquo;m concerned, are like junk food: they&rsquo;re enjoyable, but they&rsquo;re probably not worth the time you put into reading (or writing) them. If you&rsquo;re looking for what the Seattle Review of Books believes to be the books of the year, I&rsquo;d encourage you to look back through our Reviews section. Our co-founder Martin McClellan ingeniously constructed the Reviews pages to be something like browsing a bookstore.

        <div class="content">
          UNESCO just released their full list of new members of the Creative Cities Network. Seattle, which was making its second bid to become a City of Literature, is not on that list. UNESCO does not make its deliberations public, but it&rsquo;s not hard to come up with reasons why we might not have made the list this year.
The sad thing is, after the unpleasantness of the spring passed, our City of Literature organization found a terrific, capable leader in Bob Redmond.

          Toward the end of Bethany Jean Clement&rsquo;s Seattle Times scoop about the sudden and mysterious closure of the Bauhaus coffee mini-chain, there&rsquo;s this additional terrible news:
And Twice Sold Tales in Ballard [posted on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10153410672558871&id=132445238870): “Bauhaus Ballard, which my bookstore subleases from, is closing.

          We just got an invitation from Thomas Walton, the founder of PageBoy Magazine, which is one of the best print lit mags in the city. He&rsquo;s launching a new series of pop-up parties called, appropriately enough, &ldquo;Art Party.&rdquo; Because it&rsquo;s too late to get it into Your Week in Readings, I thought I&rsquo;d share it with you here:
Please join *PageBoy Magazine* for the inaugural episode of Art Party.
**What it is**: an art party with visual art and video by Sara Long.
