        <div class="content">
          HUGE congratulations are due to Seattle Review of Books contributor Nisi Shawl, whose amazing novel Everfair was just announced as a John W. Campbell Memorial Award finalist, alongside some incredible books by Colson Whitehead, Ben Winters, Don DeLillo, and Kij Johnson.
 Are you an aspiring graphic novelist? Here&rsquo;s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: The Office of Arts and Culture is offering $50,000 to &ldquo;commission one artist or artist team to research, write and illustrate a fictionalized historic graphic novel in relation to the history, story and significance of the Georgetown Steam Plant, a National Historic Landmark.

        <div class="content">
          In the New Testament, Paul is single-minded about grace. He writes about grace relentlessly, until the word becomes a catchall for pretty much anything that is good and true in the world. Grace is Godâ€™s love. Grace is the power through which you are cleansed of sin. Grace is what gives you the will to get through another day, even though every cell in your body is telling you to stay in bed.

        <div class="content">
          Just a quick note to remind you that tomorrow night at 7 p.m., we&rsquo;ll be at Third Place Books Seward Park to discuss Masha Gessen&rsquo;s The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin. Reading this book at this particular time in history has been especially weird: without mentioning Trump at all, the book has been incredibly informative about current events.
Also, I&rsquo;d urge you to listen to today&rsquo;s episode of the Ezra Klein Show, which features a brand-new long interview with Gessen.

          The tulle veil
was bone china
white and thin.
A breakable wisp.
It was fleeting.
Mother snapped
shots of it
on Sundays.
I sat in the family
rocking chair
in the unused room
with ankles crossed.
Swirl feel
under the skirt
of my church dress.
It lived there.
A lace sash
tied off
access to
the pure me.
My holiness
sewn
delicate
as an eyelet.

Sponsor Nicole Dieker is a wonder. You may have seen her reading around town, or seen her work as editor of The Billfold, or writing on Lifehacker, the Write Life, and Spark Notes.
She&rsquo;s also just published her debut novel, The Biographies of Ordinary People, and she&rsquo;s allowed us to run the full first chapter on our Sponsor&rsquo;s page for you to check out. We think you&rsquo;re gonna love it.

Ivan Schneider (far left) joined bestselling author and UW writing prof David Shields on his evening pedestrian commute two weeks ago. Judging by the evidence, their interview took a turn for the personal &mdash; but not the person you'd expect. Below is Schneider's follow-up email, thanking Shields for his time and recounting some of the ground they covered.
David Shields will join Claire Dederer to discuss their new books, *Other People* and *[Love and Trouble](http://www.
