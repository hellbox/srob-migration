          We told you last night that the bidding war for memoirs from Barack and Michelle Obama reached $60 million. Last night, Penguin Random House announced that they won the rights to publish the books. They&rsquo;re expected to arrive in 2018. Penguin Random House&rsquo;s CEO promises to &ldquo;make each of their books global publishing events of unprecedented scope and significance.&rdquo;

          With Emerald City Comicon landing at the Convention Center, all of Seattle is suffering from a ferocious case of nerd fever this weekend. But if you can’t make it to the show, you shouldn’t feel as though you’re missing out on the fun. In fact, the after-parties and side events — all of which are open to the public, even those who don’t have an ECCC lanyard — look to be more exciting than the main event.

          We&rsquo;ve got two open sponsorships in March we&rsquo;d love to get into your hands. We&rsquo;ve discounted them — $50 off for next week, March 6 - March 12, and $25 off for the week after, March 13 - March 19. Grab &lsquo;em quick!
We&rsquo;re also in super-secret testing with some new sponsorship types. Besides events and books, we&rsquo;d love to promote opportunities for writers (contests, call-for-entries, retreats, and anything else), and charitable giving.

          John Williams at the New York Times writes:
Patti Hartigan, a former theater critic for the *Boston Globe*, has been signed to write the first major biography of August Wilson, the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and one of the most significant voices in 20th-century American literature. 37 INK, an imprint at Atria Books, plans to publish the book, tentatively titled “August Wilson: The Kiln in Which He Was Fired,” in late 2019.

          Australian comic and TV writer Tom Taylor announced last night on Facebook that he&rsquo;s not going to attend Emerald City Comicon this week in Seattle. In fact, he&rsquo;s not coming to the United States at all this year. Why? Well, I&rsquo;ll let him speak for himself:
...America, through no fault of most of its citizens, doesn’t feel like a safe or welcoming travel destination at this moment.
There have been reports of interrogation, phone data downloads, requests for social media accounts, returns and five-year travel bans and everyone from children to the elderly being detained.

Sponsor Sagging Meniscus is back to show a remarkable work by Stephen Moles, called _The Most Wretched Thing Imaginable_. We've got a nice sample of his sparkling prose on our sponsor's page, but there's also two videos of Moles reading from the work, as an added treat.
Read about how Moles got started in this work by translating the song of birds into messages, and how it all relates to his Dark Meaning Research Institute.
