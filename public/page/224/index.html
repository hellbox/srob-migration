          It’s probably just a coincidence that the eighth issue of Kelly Sue DeConnick and Valentine De Landro’s sci-fi women-in-space-prison comic Bitch Planet was published less than a week after the fourth season of Orange Is the New Black arrived on Netflix. But, for the sake of people who write weekly columns about comic books, it’s a happy coincidence. From the very beginning, Bitch Planet has been compared with Orange, and it’s easy to see why: they’re both about womens’ prisons, they both feature diverse casts, and they’re both feminist-minded sociological studies of modern incarceration culture.

          You are hopefully already watching #NoBillNoBreak, the Democratic Congressional sit-in to demand a vote on gun responsibility laws. It&rsquo;s a striking bit of political drama, and a battle over one of the most important issues of our time.
I just wanted to remind you that Georgia Congressman John Lewis, the originator of this sit-in, has been at this kind of thing for a very long time, and he is the author of an amazing autobiographical comics series called The March about the fight for civil rights.

          Last month, Elissa Washuta become one of the most-envied writers in the Seattle area when she became the Fremont Bridge&rsquo;s very first writer-in-residence. UW Today interviewed Washuta about how that&rsquo;s going:   I’ll be spending many summer afternoons in a small, beautiful office in the northwest tower of the Fremont Bridge. The office is mine alone this summer, and it looks out over the Lake Washington Ship Canal. I watch the bridge open and close while I write.

          **Wednesday June 22: *Grace* Reading**
If you’re going to attend one reading by a debut novelist this year, skip the horse-chokingly thick tour-de-force by the white-boy wunderkind from Brooklyn and attend this one instead. Narrated by a ghost—“I am dead” is the first line—Natashia Deón’s riveting *Grace* tells the story of black women in America’s slave trade. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com .

          Sometimes all the good things happen in a single night. These are the nights where you want to throw yourself into a large sterile glass tube, flip a mad-scientist switch, and then send a clone or two staggering off into the night, just so you’re sure you don’t miss a thing. Thursday, June 23rd is one of those nights.
The poetry collective Margin Shift has for years been presenting some of the liveliest, most diverse readings in town.

          After [looking into why poems go viral](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/06/21/a-poet-explores-when-poems-go-viral/), Kelli Russell Agodon was not done. She wanted to talk to the people involved, too. Here's her interview with poet [Maggie Smith](https://twitter.com/maggiesmithpoet), and _Waxwing Magazine_ editors [Justin Bigos](https://twitter.com/JustinBigos), Erin Stalcup, and [W. Todd Kaneko](https://twitter.com/ToddKaneko).
The Poet of “Good Bones,” Maggie Smith **Kelli Russell Agodon: Can you trace back to the first person(s) who shared it or when it took off for you? Can you figure out (besides Waxwing) where/how it began to spread?

        <div class="content">
          When was the last time you remember a poem going viral? This week, despite ongoing reports of “poetry being dead” for the last fifteen years, Maggie Smith’s poem “Good Bones” has been shared generously and thousands of times over on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Tumblr, as well as the story being picked up in the Guardian, Slate, The Daily Dot, and The Oregonian.
I decided to follow path backwards to figure out how this poem ended up being passed on throughout the world.
