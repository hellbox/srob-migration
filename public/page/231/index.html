          This Albany Times Union interview with a local librarian named Lauren Cardinal has a very interesting aside:
**Pine Hills just went back to the Dewey Decimal System; how do you feel about it?**
I’m not sure who was happier—the staff or the patrons! The branches had been using a “bookstore model” for a few years, where books are more loosely arranged by topic, not by the official Dewey numbers and categories.

          How excited are we to have Hugo House as a sponsor? More than you can know. Unless you&rsquo;ve taken a Hugo House class, or been to a reading there, or met with one of their writers in residence, or gone to a one-day workshop, or&hellip;.well, if you know Hugo House, you know why they&rsquo;re excited.
They want you to know they&rsquo;re in their new digs on First Hill, next to the Frye Art Museum.

        <div class="content">
          For many years, I had an agreement with Jhumpa Lahiri. Well, it wasn’t so much an agreement because she never agreed to it. In any case, it went like this: for as long as Lahiri would write fiction and novels, I would read them. In my mind, Lahiri was embarking down the road to a long and fulfilling career, like a Philip Roth or a John Updike, and I was prepared to read all her new books as they came out, to expand my understanding of her writing one book at a time.

Every time I’ve visited in the three weeks that they’ve been open, the Seward Park branch of Third Place Books has been busy. The Raconteur café and restaurant in the front of the store is always slammed — it had to close for lack of food on opening day, which is a high-quality problem. And sometimes it’s hard to browse the books you want because someone else is already standing right where you want to be.

          Here Is The Powerful Letter The Stanford Victim Read Aloud To Her Attacker The letter that has taken the internet by storm. It&rsquo;s a stunning, heartbreaking, and brutal read &mdash; the judge in the case (who is up for re-election this year) gave the convicted rapist six months and probation, because a longer sentence would have &ldquo;a severe impact on him&rdquo;. As this letter so rightfully points out, the punishment doesn&rsquo;t come near to fitting the crime.
