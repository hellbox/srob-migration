Dear Cienna,
I’m a poet. I’ve been published here and there, in a magazine you’ve maybe read. Like most creative people, I’m pissed about Donald Trump and so I’ve written a few poems about current events.

          Deborah Bogle at The Advertiser reports that Australian children&rsquo;s book author Mem Fox was &ldquo;detained for two hours and aggressively interrogated by immigration officials at Los Angeles airport.&rdquo;
En route to Milwaukee for a conference on February 9, where she was to deliver the opening keynote address at a literacy conference, Fox was ushered into an airport holding room and told she was travelling on the wrong visa. This was incorrect and the US Embassy in Canberra has since apologised.

This weekend sees the inaugural Granite Noir crime fiction festival in Aberdeen, Scotland (February 24 – February 26). Heavy-hitters such as Stuart MacBride, Chris Brookmyre, Doug Johnstone and Denise Mina are just some of the featured writers participating in conversations, panels, workshops, film screenings, a special Noir at the Bar and &mdash; I particularly like the sound of this one &mdash; an afternoon discussing Agatha Christie’s favorite poisons.

          Like everyone else, you probably grew a little bit misty at the news that NASA discovered seven Earth-sized planets some 40 light years away from us. It&rsquo;s wondrous news, by which I mean it inspires wonder in us.
But one of the neater and under-covered aspects of this revelation is that astronomer Sean Raymond, one of the co-authors of the report about the planets, announced the discovery with a long poem.

          This week, I reviewed Maged Zaher&rsquo;s big new career-spanning collection, Opting Out. It&rsquo;s published by local press Chatwin Books, which is based out of Pioneer Square used bookstore Arundel Books.

If you&rsquo;ve tried to order Zaher&rsquo;s new book online, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed that it&rsquo;s not available. I talked with Chatwin/Arundel owner Phil Bevis about why that is. Basically, Arundel Books had to suddenly move their store to a newer, more favorable location.

          The eighth issue of Nick Spencer and Steve Lieber&rsquo;s crime comic The Fix was published yesterday, and this series keeps getting better. Ostensibly the story of two crooked Los Angeles cops and a drug-sniffing dog named Pretzels, The Fix keeps expanding to absorb more and more characters; what began as a character-focused heist story quickly (and effortlessly) became a huge ensemble piece.

Note those words: &ldquo;expanding,&rdquo; &ldquo;huge.&rdquo; This isn&rsquo;t the vocabulary you usually use to describe an Elmore Leonard riff.

Hardcore zombie purists may not love Isaac Marion&rsquo;s young adult novel Warm Bodies — zombies who can talk? Sacrilege! — but everyone else seems to have fallen pretty hard.

Seems impossible in 2017, but you can still find people online who proudly announce that they don’t listen to “rap-crap.” Likewise, plenty of dudes will eagerly announce that they like all kinds of music except for country and hip-hop. Those are both statements that carry a lot of unspoken weight: if you dismiss country music and hip-hop with one broad shrug, you are basically saying “poor people make me uncomfortable and I prize comfort over everything else, including intellectual curiosity.
