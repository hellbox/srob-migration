Friday November 18th: As Sarah Galvin noted in her excellent review, **Michelle Tea** is an iconic memoirist and queer sex symbol. Her newest book, *Black Wave*, is a memoir with a dystopic novel laid over the top, which kind of resembles the world in which we live right now.

          New column! New Every month, Nisi Shawl is going to present us with news and updates from her perch overlooking the world of science-fiction, fantasy, and horror. Welcome Nisi!
Hello from your new skiffy columnist! I’m very gratified that I’ve been asked to provide you with monthly doses of clear-eyed science-fiction-fantasy-and-horror analysis, accompanied by the lamentation, kvelling, and Inside Baseball-like scuttlebutt you’d expect from a longtime reader and writer of that sort of thing.

Imagine if cosplay was a thing in the early 1990s. Now imagine that a Fantagraphics cartoonist at the time — Dan Clowes, maybe — made a comic about people who dressed up like superheroes at comics conventions. You could practically imagine the scorn steaming off the page, can’t you? The 1990s alternative comics scene was such a self-consciously self-reflexive organism that it could only refer to comics and nerd culture by mocking it.

        <div class="content">
          If you ever attend a David Sedaris reading, I suggest you watch him closely. You’ll see that as he reads, he keeps a pencil in his hand and he makes notations on the text. Sometimes if you pay close attention to his hands, you can see him cross out a word that he stumbles on, or add a word when an improvisation works particularly well. When you attend a Sedaris reading, you’re not just watching a performance — you’re taking part in an editing session.

          Harry Farley at Christian Today reports that Amazon&rsquo;s new advertisement features a vicar from the Church of England and an imam getting along. I&rsquo;m sure it delivers a terrific message of togetherness, but I&rsquo;ll have to take Farley&rsquo;s word for it:

In the shadow of this disastrous election, it’s almost impossible to think about Christmas. But whether you’re ready or not, the holidays are coming, and there are lots of people you love out there in the world who deserve a little happiness in their lives. Books are the best gift: they’re deeply personal, they help us empathize with each other, and they’re so much more meaningful than, say, a juicer.
