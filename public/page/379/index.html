          This post at Lady Business begins:
This project demonstrates that SFF books by or about cis women are less likely to win awards than books by or about cis men. Trans and nonbinary authors do not win awards at all, and trans or nonbinary protagonists are extremely rare. Overall, there were more award-winning books written by cis men about cis men than there were books by women about anybody... While of course the news they deliver is bad, it&rsquo;s heartening to see other people taking up Nicola Griffith&rsquo;s charge to count the number of womens&rsquo; voices in literature.

          Marcellus Turner, the City Librarian at Seattle Public Library, has issued a letter responding to public criticism of the library&rsquo;s rebranding campaign, which I wrote about last week. Turner writes that the rebranding has&hellip;
...generated a flurry of interest and opinions from media representatives and the public. A recent exchange with a passionate Library supporter got at the heart of the concerns voiced by many around the Library’s proposed rebranding. That supporter didn’t see the need for changing the library name or brand.

          1. Say No Lame! Say no lame! Say we care. Terror can’t tell
and bears a crown in the kitchen, may we?
Who cares: cunt can’t battle, key won’t tear.
Ugly decay, care for Pa and tell, we lonely.
So jail men care, met a lavish man, met a landlord.
(Eggpisode loiter ha! Advance don’t at all, assuming mellow)
Me, countless, out to tear. Sane no, lend me.
Say I can’t rain, end me.

          Galleycat has assembled excerpts of the ten most frequently challenged library books of 2015. Seattle&rsquo;s own Sherman Alexie and Ellen Forney are right up at the top of the list with The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. Go give these books a try, and if you&rsquo;re interested in reading further, please acquire copies of the books from your local library or independent bookstore. Banned Book Week isn&rsquo;t just about celebrating the authors who push the boundaries of what&rsquo;s acceptable; it&rsquo;s also about celebrating the heroes who make those books available for everyone.

          Let’s make one thing perfectly clear as we begin: Edward Snowden is an American hero. You may feel differently about the subject of Edward Snowden than I do. If so, I’m going to advise you that you’re perfectly welcome to read the rest of this book review, but it’s probably going to make you mad. I’m probably not going to change your mind and you’re probably not going to change mine.

MONDAY It’s not very often that I send you out to Bellevue, but tonight I bring you a very good reason to head east: the Bellevue branch of University Book Store hosts an evening with a number of poets reading from Raising Lily Ledbetter, a compelling anthology of poetry about women at work that I reviewed a few weeks ago. Readers include Carolyne Wright, Eugenia Toledo, Kathya Alexander, Deborah Woodard, Judith Roche, Erin Fristad, and Mary Ellen Talley.
