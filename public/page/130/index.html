          John Jackson Miller at Comichron reports on some apparent upcoming changes to the New York Times&rsquo;s bestseller list, including the deletion of the graphic novel bestsellers. He continues:
Following an early report, I communicated with a contact who receives an advance copy [of the list] who noted there are further changes, including the elimination of the mass-market paperback charts and the merger of the e-book-only list with the fiction list. Other categories are reduced in size; the adult trade fiction list goes from 15 entries to 10, while the highest-profile list, the hardcovers, is cut from 20 entries to 15.

          Jack Kirby&rsquo;s Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth was my favorite childhood comic. I didn&rsquo;t know it was a ripoff of the first Planet of the Apes movie at the time I started reading my brother&rsquo;s old issues. In fact, I probably started reading Kamandi a full decade before the first time I saw Planet of the Apes. And while I love the Apes reboot films, I still prefer Kamandi.

          At some point, you have to figure, Jon Raymond will get sick of people comparing him to Raymond Carver. In reviews, the Portland-based author is said to “evoke” or hail “from the school of” Carver. Some reviewers even make the rare and fascinating observation that Raymond’s last name and Carver’s first name are — gasp — the EXACT SAME NAME. (Full disclosure, I very well may have made that Raymond-Carver comparison in past reviews; I’m too embarrassed to Google myself and find out.
