          Yesterday, Fantagraphics Books published a page called &ldquo;The Truth About Pepe.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s an attempt to reclaim cartoonist Matt Furie&rsquo;s character Pepe the frog from the racist so-called &ldquo;alt-right&rdquo; Trump supporters who have adopted the cartoon frog as an in-joke, a meme, and as a cultural signifier. Pepe has since been identified as a hate symbol. Fantagraphics says:
Having your creation appropriated without consent is never something an artist wants to suffer, but having it done in the service of such repellent hatred — and thereby dragging your name into the conversation, as well — makes it considerably more troubling.

          The J. Peterman catalog is a seminal 1990s artifact. The catalogs, which featured expensive vintage-style clothing from far-flung locales rendered in hand-drawn illustrations, were best known for their overwritten catalog copy. The text had an upscale, worldly air, and it almost always skittered on the line of self-parody, relaying adventures in foreign lands with language that was at once self-important and wildly entertaining, overblown and amusing.
Here’s a sample of a J.

The first of what is sure to be many Seattle-area periodicals trying to fill the void left by shuttered comics anthology Intruder has arrived, accompanied by a fart noise. The first issue of Fart Magazine, edited by Mark Allender, includes contributions from Intruder contributors like Marc Palm and Seth Goodkind.
Unlike Intruder, Fart isn’t an all-comics joint; magazine-like, it features text pieces (essays from contributors like Emmett Montgomery and Elicia Sanchez) and a celebrity interview (with comedian Brian Posehn).

          If you&rsquo;re not aware of the @manwhohasitall Twitter feed, I&rsquo;d encourage you to follow it. It&rsquo;s a simple premise — reversing the gender on common ignorant sexist statements — that pays off in so many enjoyable ways. Some examples:
"Men shouldn't run for president because of their hormones," says male CEO, Paul, 60. Interesting that this comment comes from a man. "I don't mind being called a gentleman driver because it's true, I'm a gentleman and I'm a driver.

          This ABC News story certainly isn&rsquo;t terrifying or anything.
The executive director of the Kansas City library system says he is "outraged" that prosecutors continue to pursue charges against a man who was arrested after asking pointed questions during a library discussion about the Middle East peace process and an employee who tried to intervene.
