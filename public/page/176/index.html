          November is fast approaching, which means it&rsquo;s time for National Novel Writing Month. Our own advice columnist, Cienna Madrid, is no novice when it comes to NaNoWriMo, and so she&rsquo;d like to offer up her column for writing advice for the entire month of November.
Feel free to ask Cienna any questions about the process of writing (Do you have a character who&rsquo;s just not doing what she&rsquo;s supposed to do?

          Over the weekend, Spokane author Sharma Shields and Seattle authors Erik Larson and Jessixa Bagley won big at the Washington State Book Awards. St. Louis poet Carl Phillips, who was born in Washington but has not lived in Washington state for decades, also won. (Here&rsquo;s hoping the Washington Center for the Book at the Seattle Public Library updates the rules to ensure to favor Washington writers in the future.) Moira Macdonald at the Seattle Times has a list of all the winners.

          Our October Bookstore of the Month, Louis Collins Books, is in a bright blue building at the intersection of 12th and Denny. Collins has been selling books out of this building for decades, and he’s been in the book business for nearly 50 years. Since he does most of his business online, Louis Collins Books is only open for browsing by appointment. I’d urge you to make an appointment: it’s a beautiful space, completely taken over by used and rare books.

          Dark Fruit: A Cultural and Personal History of the Plum A wonderful piece by Anca Szilágyi on the cultural history and meaning of plums.
 In the beginning, there was _găluşti cu prune_ — plum dumplings. My mother’s mother, in August, plum season, steaming up the kitchen, boiling them in a big pot. These were the days before summer camp, before air conditioning. An electrical storm was coming. She warned me not to turn on the television or switch on the light.

          I&rsquo;m thrilled to hear that the great Spokane alternative weekly the Inlander — which, full disclosure, publishes my writing sometimes — is planning a poetry issue. And if you live in eastern Washington, they want you to send your poetry to them sometime before November 20th. They will publish roughly a dozen poems, with each poet receiving $40 for their work. Many thanks to the Inlander for supporting local poetry; I can&rsquo;t wait to read this issue.
