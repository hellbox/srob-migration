          Yesterday, Artist Trust announced that Seattle poet Quenton Baker received the $15,000 James W. Ray Venture Project Award, which &ldquo;support[s] artistic excellence and the development of new ideas through individual and collaborative projects.&rdquo; Baker is going to devote the prize money to a full-length project about the only successful large-scale slave rebellion in United States history. We are so excited to see this book.
Baker, who is also a teacher, will publish his first full-length collection, This Glittering Republic, next year with Willow Books.

          Wednesday October 12th: Booktoberfest
As part of Seattle Public Library’s Booktoberfest program, librarians are taking to the bars of Seattle to encourage bookish discussion with boozy Seattleites. Tonight’s happy hour is at the Hideout, which is one of the best bars in town for total strangers to sit down and strike up a conversation with each other. The Hideout, 1005 Boren Ave., http://hideoutseattle.com . Free. 21+. 5 p.m. 
**Thursday October 13th: Noir at the Bar **

          Maybe this election cycle, with its casual invocation of nuclear war and portraits of American landscapes as dystopian nightmares, will finally break the fever of apocalyptic fiction that has held a tight grip on America’s popular consciousness for well over a decade now. Maybe — and this is one of those predictions that will likely sound very dumb six months from now — maybe it’s time to think about a better future again.

          If you’ve attended a meeting of the Seattle City Council over the last few months — as part of the #BlocktheBunker movement, say, or as a worker fighting for secure scheduling — odds are good you’ve heard at least one poet read their work aloud. As part of her role as Seattle’s very first Civic Poet, Claudia Castro Luna curates the poetry readings that open City Council meetings. To many who attend council meetings on official business, this is probably just a bit of pointless civic nonsense to tolerate, some grandstanding to keep the arts community placated.

        <div class="content">
          We caught wind of this event too late for tomorrow&rsquo;s reading calendar, but it&rsquo;s too cool not to mention. The 2016 Taste of Iceland festival is happening this week, and it features a free reading at KEXP&rsquo;s brand-spanking new headquarters (472 1st Ave. N) on Friday, October 14th. Iceland is one of the most literary nations on earth, with more authors per capita than anywhere else, and it&rsquo;s got a long, rich and unbroken tradition of literature that you should learn more about.
