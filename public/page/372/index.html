          It’s the year 2018. In a press conference, NASA scientists have just announced a shocking new discovery. As part of their research into cryogenic sleep for deep-space flights, they have finally uncovered the secret of immortality. At that announcement, the press corps immediately respond with murmuring and more exciteable, goose-like noises, but as the sussuration begins to build into a straight-on frenzy, the lead scientist raises her hands. Wait a minute, she says to the assembled media.

          Over at Crosscut, Knute Berger reports back on a little archaeological digging he did into Seattle&rsquo;s book history. He believes he may have found a record from Seattle&rsquo;s very first Library. Go read the essay, which began as a speech Berger delivered at an event celebrating Seattle&rsquo;s newest library, Folio Seattle.

        <div class="content">
          To tell the truth, I have forgotten
which year goes with what.
My memory: as good as milk.
My family: spoiled through
and through. Pure as mold
on a September nectarine,
we refuse to announce defeat,
death. In this house, the margins
of mourning are tucked in,
pleated to the neck.
In August, my uncle dies
and no one tells his children.
He crosses his arms
in a blue suit in a coffin

          Since Shelf Awareness published the rumors that Amazon is preparing to open a bookstore in University Village, Geekwire has done a little digging into Seattle public records and uncovered blue prints for a space that &ldquo;will combine elements of an Apple store and a Barnes &amp; Noble, with areas for browsing books and checking out and buying new devices.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a huge space.

        <div class="content">
          On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our first suggested itinerary:
New literary magazines and publishers are popping up all the time in Seattle, and Lit Crawl is a great opportunity to sample what&rsquo;s out there.

        <div class="content">
          Here&rsquo;s a fun exercise: guess which of these four quotes about money and class are actually from the recent Jonathan Franzen profile in the Financial Times and which of these quotes I made up to make Jonathan Franzen sound bad.
1. Jonathan Franzen understands poverty:
“I am literally, in terms of my income, a 1 per center, yes,” he says, his eyes not on me but on the empty table next to us.

          Having a conversation with white people about race — specifically, about black people in America, inspired, say, by the shooting of Michael Brown or Ta-Nehisi Coates&rsquo; essay on reparations — is easy until you get to one of those words. Privilege, say, or supremacy, or institutional, or, god forbid, reparations. Those words are hard because white people hear them differently than minorities. White people hear &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; and think &ldquo;this person wants me to give up power.

        <div class="content">
          Over the weekend, the Washington State Book Awards were given out in a ceremony at Seattle Public Library. Mary Ann Gwinn at the Seattle Times has a full list of winners. It&rsquo;s nice to see the awards spread around the state — winners include Spokane County novelist Bruce Holbert, Spokane poet Tod Marshall, and Tacoma historian Justin Wadland — but it&rsquo;s disappointing to see that the major adult awards went to white dudes.

          MONDAY Our week begins with the Monorail Poetry Series at Fred Wildlife Refuge. Local author Tara Atkinson, who has a book coming out from Instant Future soon that I’m very excited to read, will be joined by Portland author Rachael Jensen and a Brooklyn writer with the unbelievable name of Sampson Starkweather. Jensen recently published her first chapbook with Snoot Books, and Starkweather has written a lot of books and also created “a multi-media website of pop/love GIF poems.
