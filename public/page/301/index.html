Seattle author Matt Ruff’s new novel [*Lovecraft Country*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/caught-after-dark-in-lovecraft-country/) is a thoughtful, rewarding examination of the connection between genre and American racism. Specifically, it’s a story that juxtaposes America’s shameful history of systemic racism with the racist history of American science fiction. While the former is well-documented, sci-fi’s racist past is much less overt.
The pivot-point for the novel is arguably the most famous racist in American literary history: HP Lovecraft, the cult horror writer who was an unabashed white supremacist.

        <div class="content">
          If you were to ask me to nominate one cartoonist to create a comic book adaptation of a Todd Solondz film, I would, without a second thought, choose Nick Drnaso. Like Solondz&rsquo;s films, the world in Drnaso’s new collection Beverly is ugly and mundane; unattractive Americans live their boring lives in bland surroundings — cut-rate hotel rooms, tract housing. Drnaso draws his figures with simple lines, often at the middle distance.

        <div class="content">
          We here at the Seattle Review of Books are incredibly excited for Link Light Rail to open to Capitol Hill and the University District. (Fun fact: light rail opens on the exact same weekend as the APRIL Festival&rsquo;s big book fair at the Hugo House! That&rsquo;s your Sunday, March 20th all sorted for you.) And this video from Sound Transit profiling Seattle cartoonist Ellen Forney is only getting us more excited about launch-day, especially because it&rsquo;s got plenty of footage of the installation of Forney&rsquo;s beautiful illustrations of giant hands in the Capitol Hill station.

          This is big news: independent comics publisher Image Comics — home of some of the best ongoing comics series in America today including Saga, The Walking Dead, and Bitch Planet — just announced that they&rsquo;re going to host Image Expo, their new-title showcase, at Emerald City Comicon this year. This is the first time they&rsquo;ve partnered with a pre-existing convention for the Expo, and it&rsquo;s also the first time the Expo will take place in Seattle.

        <div class="content">
          The thing you realize within a few seconds of talking to University Book Store’s Caitlin is that she reads a lot. Like, a lot. She estimates she plows through about five books a week, on average. “I read fast,” she admits. “Partly because when I was in college, I would do theater, and I would also have to read James Fenimore Cooper or *Moby Dick*” for class assignments. Every time I see Caitlin, she’s gushing about some book that just came out, or that is about to come out, or that will be out in a month or two.

          After a long weekend, we&rsquo;re left with too much news for one single Book News Roundup to contain!
 Capitol Hill Seattle Blog has the skinny on V2, the new temporary arts space in the old Value Village building on Capitol Hill&rsquo;s 11th Ave. Literary tenants include Bumbershoot producer One Reel and possibly Hugo House, and the space will be broken up into &ldquo;performance areas, rental studios, classrooms, offices, and storage.

        <div class="content">
          Two Sylvias Press&rsquo;s annual chapbook contest is now open for submissions. The reading fee is $15, but the payoff is pretty great: the winner gets $400 and 20 copies of their finished chapbook. A poem by the winner of 2014&rsquo;s chapbook contest, Cecilia Woloch, was recently featured in the New York Times Magazine.
 We&rsquo;ve already suggested two great events for tonight, but we just learned about this event happening in the Husky Union Building on the UW campus tonight, and we wanted you to know about it: an evening of Arabic Poetry and Music, featuring poetry read in English and in Arabic by students.
