It&rsquo;s strange: Most everyone at the Reading Through It Book Club last night agreed that Jonathan Haidt&rsquo;s book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided By Politics and Religion was the most useful book we&rsquo;ve read so far in our quest to understand the presidency of Donald Trump. One book club member even said that she felt if she had read The Righteous Mind before the election, she&rsquo;d probably have been able to predict that Trump would win.

          Ordinarily, I use this space to write about the comics that I&rsquo;ve read over the past week. But this Saturday is Free Comic Book Day — that nationwide celebration of the belief that there&rsquo;s a comic out there for everyone — and so we&rsquo;re going to look forward for a change. If you&rsquo;ve never participated before, you should know that it&rsquo;s pretty simple: walk into the store, get some comics for free.

Wednesday May 3rd: Reading Through It: *The Righteous Mind*
I hope you’ll join us for our book club examining the causes and effects of Donald Trump’s presidency. It’s been a total delight so far, full of brainy, passionate discussion.

        <div class="content">
          Spokane-by-way-of-Seattle author Kate Lebo&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;A Prayer to Cathy McMorris Rodgers for Intercession on My Behalf&rdquo; at Blood Orange Review is exactly what a political poem should be: it is reasonable, and passionate, and meaningful. The poem is aimed directly at McMorris Rodgers, who is Lebo&rsquo;s Congressional representative, and it&rsquo;s a plea for the congresswoman to remember everyone that she represents in the House. On this week when House Republicans seem to be considering, yet again, the repeal of Obamacare, the poem lands with a special weight.

        <div class="content">
          Every year, the Seattle Public Library chooses one book to headline its “Seattle Reads” program. The idea is to get as many copies of a single title into as many hands as possible, to bring the author to as many of Seattle’s neighborhoods as they can in a single week, and to examine a book thoroughly. It’s a noble idea and it raises some interesting questions about place and readership: does Ballard, say, read a book differently than Rainier Valley?

Highlights include a series spotlighting films from nations on President Trump&rsquo;s travel ban list, an education series for kids, and a heavy focus on Northwest filmmakers, women directors, and films that as of yet have no established North American premiere dates.

          Funny poems are tough to pull off. I’m not talking, here, about poems with humor in them; almost every good poem has at least one funny thing smuggled inside of it. No, I mean poems with punchlines, poems written with the intent of making readers laugh out loud. Those are very hard to get right; too often, funny poems veer into dad joke territory. They try too hard, they screech too loud, and they flop gracelessly.
