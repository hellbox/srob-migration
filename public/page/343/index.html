          Every once in a while, a truly individual voice will emerge out of the morass of conventional superhero comics. These occasions are always a surprise — nobody could have predicted that Swamp Thing would become a convergence point between art and commercial comics until Alan Moore and Steve Bissette landed on the book, and nobody expected much of Daredevil until Frank Miller was allowed to get experimental with the character. It’s too early to draw a comparison Tom King and Gabriel Hernandez Walta’s The Vision to those two examples, but two issues into the series, it’s already clear that the book is something special.

          Teju Cole published a poem at the New Inquiry in response to today&rsquo;s terrible news out of San Bernardino. It&rsquo;s a moving reminder that poetry can respond to current events, can be as timely as a thinkpiece, can be so much more meaningful than a hot take on Twitter.

          The fabulous Short Run Comix &amp; Arts Festival is throwing a holiday fundraising art auction, and it&rsquo;s packed with all sorts of one-of-a-kind gift ideas. Highlights include:
 A signed copy of Seattle cartoonist Colleen Frakes&rsquo;s memoir Prison Island, along with a piece of original art. (Read my review of Prison Island here.)
 A watercolor painting by newly local cartoonist Sarah Glidden.
 An original portrait from Seattle cartoonist Kelly Froh.

          At 2 pm, Bainbridge Island author Jonathan Evison, author of novels like This Is Your Life, Harriet Chance! and the excellent The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving will be doing an Ask Me Anything on Reddit. Follow this link and, well, ask Evison anything. In my experience, he&rsquo;s always been remarkably open in interviews, from the business side of things to what he thinks of other writers. I can pretty much guarantee he&rsquo;ll be painfully honest, which makes this an interesting opportunity for those burning questions you&rsquo;ve always wanted to drop on a novelist.

          In the December issue of the New York Review of Books, Doubleday executive editor Gerald Howard takes on reviewer Daniel Mendelsohn for his review of the Doubleday novel A Little Life. Howard&rsquo;s letter concludes: &ldquo;At bottom Mendelsohn seems to have decided that A Little Life just appeals to the wrong kind of reader. That’s an invidious distinction unworthy of a critic of his usually fine discernment.&rdquo;
This is not the only charge levied against this particular reviewer and this particular review.

          (Every Wednesday in December before Christmas, we’ll talk to a Seattle bookseller about the gift book they’re most excited about this season.)
Alex Gholz, bookseller at Third Place Books Ravenna, has eclectic tastes. His recent reading of James S.A. Corey’s Leviathan Wakes put him on a brief space opera kick — he’s right now reading Alatair Reynold’s Revelation Space, and after that he’s planning to dive into Seth Dickinson’s political fantasy novel The Traitor Baru Cormorant.

          Two housekeeping issues we&rsquo;d like to share with our readers:
 If you&rsquo;re a Hugo House member, you can now sign up for &ldquo;The You Review of Books,&rdquo; a book reviewing class taught by myself and Seattle Review of Books co-founder Martin McClellan. We hope to teach you how to communicate with art, how to be a better reader, and how to appreciate book reviewing as an art form. If you&rsquo;re not a Hugo House member, you&rsquo;ll be able to sign up for the class starting next week.

          See You in the Morning, Mairead Case’s debut novel, is a love story if a love story means trying to become someone who doesn’t always feel shut off. It’s the summer before senior year in high school, and the unnamed narrator is already planning to move away from a town that’s maybe too comfortable or not comfortable enough, not dreamy but not dreary — maybe there aren’t enough options, but what options is this narrator looking for?

        <div class="content">
          Last month, the Seattle poetry world lost one of its giants when Madeline DeFrees passed away. DeFrees was one of the most vibrant, evocative poets the Pacific Northwest has ever produced, and the Seattle Review of Books wanted to find some way to honor her life, and to bring her work to new audiences. Here’s one way to do that: every Tuesday for the month of December, we’ll present a DeFrees poem.
