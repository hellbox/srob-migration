          On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our fourth suggested itinerary:
Look: sometimes you don&rsquo;t want to go to a reading just to hear some moron white guy complain about being a white guy.

The world ends in superhero comics all the time. DC Comics published a company-wide crossover called Final Night almost twenty years ago in which superheroes and their supporting casts believed their worlds were about to end for real (no, for really real this time).

        <div class="content">
          Adolescence is the uncomfortable transition from childhood, when one assumes that one is the center of the universe, to adulthood, when one realizes that this is not true. Just about everything we understand about teenagers makes sense when viewed from this lens — the sense of injustice, the anger, the nihilism. It takes at least a full decade just to get over the horrific realization that the universe will continue without us one day.

Our October Bookstore of the Month is a special one, because it’s a bookstore that will only exist in the world for one day. [The Short Run Comix & Arts Festival](http://www.shortrun.org/) will take place this year on October 31st at Fisher Pavilion in the Seattle Center, and for that one day, it will be the largest bookseller of independent literature, zines, and comics in the Seattle area. Every week this month, we’ll highlight a different Short Run exhibitor, to give you a better idea of the scope and breadth of the festival.

          Great news! Jamaican novelist Marlon James has won the booker for A Brief History of Seven Killings. Everybody I know who has read this book has done nothing but rave about it, and as this linked BBC article says: “The judges had come to a unanimous decision in less than two hours.”
Congratulations to James. If you’d like to know more about him — and his winning book — Jess Walter and Sherman Alexie recently talked to him on their podcast A Tiny Sense of Accomplishment.

You could attend a whole evening&rsquo;s worth of poetry readings at Lit Crawl with a nice mix of new, up-and-coming, and established names, providing an excellent cross-section of where Northwest poetry is right now.

          If you haven&rsquo;t yet read President Obama&rsquo;s interview with the incredible novelist Marilynne Robinson in the New York Review of Books, please take the time to read it. I can&rsquo;t recall a sitting president ever doing something quite like this. It&rsquo;s just too delightful for words.
