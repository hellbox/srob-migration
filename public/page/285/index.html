          The Japan News reports:
A short-form novel “coauthored” by humans and an artificial intelligence (AI) program passed the first screening process for a domestic literary prize, it was announced on Monday. However, the book did not win the final prize. Some of you out there may interpret this news as apocalyptic. If so, you should be warned that the apocalypse is upon us already: news agencies publish stories written by robots on a regular basis, though this programmer&rsquo;s prediction that a robot would win the Pulitzer by 2016 seems unlikely to come true.

          **Wednesday March 23: Robert Sawyer**
Sawyer’s science fiction novels are about what happens when you introduce one high-concept sci-fi element to an otherwise ordinary world. He then spends the rest of the book examining the ramifications of that collision. His newest, *Quantum Night*, uses experimental psychology and quantum physics to explore human nature. *University Book Store, 4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, [bookstore.washington.edu](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu). Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*

          When Seattle novelist Bharti Kirchner was growing up in Kolkata, she writes in the afterword to her new novel Goddess of Fire, she “yearned to learn more about Job Charnock, a faithful servant of the English East India Company in its early days, who was believed to have founded Kolkata (then known as Calcutta).” But not much information about Charnock has survived from 17th century India to the present day. So Kirchner spent a lifetime obsessing over the few facts available, including an account that Charnock saved a young Indian girl from being tossed onto her deceased husband’s funeral pyre, and eventually married her.

          Shakespeare&rsquo;s First Folio is now at the Seattle Public Library. (At the Seattle Times, Mary Ann Gwinn wrote about the opening festivities for the Folio.) You can find a full calendar of Folio-related events — including readings, movies, plays, music and more — on SPL&rsquo;s website, and you can get tickets to visit the Folio here.
 You can now sign up for Hugo House&rsquo;s spring quarter classes online.

          All poetry is political.
This is not to say that poetry is an especially political form. All poetry is political because all poetry is created by people, and all people are political animals.
And, yes, in fact, poetry is whatever people are: political, sure — but also loving, spiteful, awkward, romantic, horny, judgmental, and overly obsessed with our little glowing screens.
So I guess what I’m saying here is that all poetry is horny.

          Due to a filing error, we mistakenly attributed a poem by a different poet to Jane Wong. The mistake was entirely ours, and we have deleted the post from the site and social media. We apologize to Jane Wong for the egregious mistake, and to our readers, and we’ll put procedures in place to ensure it won’t happen again.
