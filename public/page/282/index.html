          Correspondant Rachel Kessler agreed to be our eyes-on-the-ground at the AWP festival this year. Join us for her daily updates as the conference unfolds
The AWP, which stands for Association of Writers and Writing Programs, is the big annual literary conference that takes place in a different city each year. This year it is happening in downtown LA, right next to the Lakers home court. The three-day conference includes readings, panel discussions, pedagogy talks, educator caucuses, and countless offsite events, like poetry pool parties, as well as a sprawling bookfair with hundred of authors signing.

        <div class="content">
          The Seattle Review of Books is looking for a freelance Public Diversity Editor. Since that&rsquo;s a term we just made up, we should probably explain what it is.
We&rsquo;re two white guys. One of our goals with the site was to try to do a good job with representation, to create a site that reflects the diversity of the literary community. We thought one way to guard against us succumbing to our own unconscious biases would be to hire an outside person to check our work and report back to our readers.

          The Joyce Maynard reading we selected as tonight&rsquo;s best literary event has been canceled due to an illness in Maynard&rsquo;s family. We hope to see her again in Seattle soon under better circumstances.

        <div class="content">
          In case you were staring out at sunny skies and planning what to do this weekend, let me just make one thing abundantly clear: *Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice* is every bit as terrible as you’ve heard. It is not so-bad-it’s-good. It’s just bad: inept, crass, soulless, mean-spirited, and dumb. Don’t pay money to see it.
But this isn’t another review of that movie (the world doesn’t need any more of those) and it’s not another middle-aged white dude whining about his childhood being stolen from him (the world didn’t need one of those).

        <div class="content">
          Shelf Awareness reports that local book distributor Partners/West is closing. The Renton office will stop delivering books on April 1st. This is a huge bummer; it means that local bookstores in need of rush titles will have to rely on Ingram, the largest book distributor in the country. Though most bookstores try to order direct from publishers whenever possible because the discounts are better, distributors are the best way for bookstores to get books in a hurry.

Our Larger Literary Landscape count is in its third year, and we are seeing results worth celebrating!
Of the 26 publications in our 2015 Larger Literary Landscape Count, 15 of them published as many bylines by women writers as men, or more!
