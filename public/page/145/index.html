Dear Cienna,
I’m writing because a loudmouth white man has too much power. (Not THAT loudmouth white man, though if you have any advice on surviving Donald Trump’s administration I’d love to hear it.

**The Beautiful Struggle**
In a conversation facilitated by the good people at Seattle Public Library, Luzviminda Uruzi “Lulu” Carpenter leads Seattle-area LGBTQ leaders (including Dominique Stephens, Luis Fernando Ramirez, and Sonj Basha) in a conversation about surviving violence of all stripes (racism, transphobia) and building communities together.

        <div class="content">
          Over at the Ploughshares blog, Seattle writer Ian Denning wrote an excellent piece about Benjamin Percy&rsquo;s how-to-write guide, Thrill Me. Denning recalled my review of Percy&rsquo;s craft talk at the Hugo House from last year, in which I was thoroughly unimpressed by the unoriginality of Percy&rsquo;s advice. Denning makes the argument that while Percy&rsquo;s advice may lean toward the oft-repeated, his &ldquo;good-but-not-groundbreaking craft book&rdquo; could serve as &ldquo;a cheerleader&rdquo; to comfort an aspiring writer.

        <div class="content">
          One Week in the Library comes in a format that doesn’t get enough play in comics shops: a ten dollar “graphic novella” that tells a single story from beginning to end. It’s a great format — not quite long enough to be a full-sized graphic novel, but longer than your standard monthly comics issue. More cartoonists should work at this size; it’s a great length for the medium.

Unfortunately, One Week at the Library isn’t the best advertisement for the format.

          Sam Jordison&rsquo;s essay in the Guardian about how Fight Club activated a generation of young white men and turned them into trolls, Trump fans, fascists, and Gamergaters is well worth your time:
Rereading the novel in 2016 is chilling. Researching the book online, I found myself falling down a dark wormhole of fascistic websites that quote big chunks of David Fincher’s film adaptation as parts of their credo; even though parts are almost verbatim from the book, alt-right types tend to quote the film – because they either don’t agree with the overall message of Palahniuk’s book or they haven’t bothered to read it.

Seattle author Donna Miscolta’s new book of linked short stories, *Hola and Goodbye* follows multiple generations of women in a Latinx family as they come to America and forge new paths for themselves, facing tremendous sexism, racism, and economic barriers. This is a heartfelt American story that was published at exactly the right time.

          We’re coming up on the end of the year, and the number of available literary events are rapidly declining. Don’t get me wrong — there are still plenty of readings between now and the end of the year, but this is the one time of year when literary-minded folks are not spoiled for choice: rather than three or four good options a day, Seattle’s readers readers are lucky to get one.
