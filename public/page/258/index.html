          The awesome organizers of comics and art show Short Run made a special announcement about their upcoming fall show: Special guests at the show this year will include Vanessa Davis and Trevor Alixopulos. Davis&rsquo;s comic Make Me a Woman was published by Drawn &amp; Quarterly, and Alixopulos is an up-and-comer who will be in the newest volume of the Kramer&rsquo;s Ergot anthology. In case you&rsquo;ve missed it, Short Run also revealed the identity of this year&rsquo;s Dash grant recipient, a program that provides funds to an artist to make a new comic in time for the show; this year&rsquo;s Dash winner is a new-to-Seattle cartoonist named Brendan Kiefer.

          Going into this book, I was feeling extremely prejudiced against standard-issue American singer-songwriter guitar music. Especially traditional stuff. We’re inundated in Seattle. And Woody Guthrie: I get it. He was a socialist protest singer. He was down with the Popular Front in the 1940s. He called his guitar a machine. He meant for it to kill fascists. We would vote Woody Guthrie onto our city council if we could. The songs he wrote still currently catch hella burn at coffeeshops citywide, and on KEXP he’s always there, thanks to the Wilco/Billy Bragg “Mermaid Avenue” record from 18 years ago.

The Seattle International Film Festival kicks off tonight, and the next four weeks will bring hundreds of movies from around the world to venues throughout the region. You should absolutely take part in SIFF; it’s one of the cultural events that shapes and defines the city. Because we know you love books — you’re on this site, after all — we thought we’d assemble SIFF’s most literary films into an alphabetical list for you, along with SIFF’s descriptions.

        <div class="content">
          All the cool literary people are writing comics now. Ta-Nehisi Coates is doing an excellent job with Black Panther, Margaret Atwood’s comic Angel Catbird is coming out sometime this year, and yesterday the very first issue of sci-fi legend William Gibson’s very first comic, Archangel, hit the stands. Co-created with screenwriter Michael St. John Smith and illustrated by comics veteran Butch Guice, Archangel is closer to Gibson&rsquo;s previously published work than, say, Black Panther is to Between the World and Me, but Gibson is definitely marking new territory here; this is not a lazy cash-grab Neuromancer sequel in comic form or anything so crass.

Lindy West’s debut memoir, *Shrill* was published yesterday to great acclaim. I had to recuse myself from reviewing it for the *Seattle Review of Books* due to personal circumstances; I was Lindy’s coworker at *The Stranger* for three years, and she asked me to read *Shrill* before its publication. And so I know I’m biased, but I do love this book: I think *Shrill* is funny and honest and heartbreaking and empowering and meaningful.

        <div class="content">
          Our friends at Seattlish just broke the story of a class-action lawsuit filed against the owners of Emerald City Comicon for not paying their volunteers. (ECCC officially calls its volunteers &ldquo;minions,&rdquo; which is not a very good look; ECCC vendors and talent have complained to us about how &ldquo;demeaning&rdquo; that title is on multiple occasions.) Seattlish explains:
According to the suit, the volunteers are expected to work essentially as paid workers would — performing functions necessary to the operation of the convention — but aren’t required to be paid for their labor or their overtime due to their volunteer status.
