The story I heard was that Seattle enlarged Montlake Avenue and took half of one man's plot by eminent domain.

          *(Once in a while, I take a new book with me to lunch and give it a half an hour or so to grab my attention. Lunch Date is my judgment on that speed-dating experience.)*
**Who’s your date today?** [*Exit West*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735212176), a novel by Mohsin Hamid.
**Where’d you go?** I was in Tacoma for a day trip and stopped by [the MSM Deli](https://www.zomato.com/tacoma-wa/msm-deli-tacoma/menu), a legendary lunch spot that doesn't offer much by way of ambiance — it's a convenience store with some card tables — but enjoys a large Northwest fanbase.

Sometimes we hear about events too late to get them in the readings calendar for the week, but we still think they&rsquo;re worthy events that you should know about. Here are two:
 Tomorrow from 3 to 6 pm, it&rsquo;s Trivia for a Cause at Green Bean Coffeehouse in Greenwood. This event is a fundraiser for the Eastside Mosque, which was damaged in an arson fire back in January. There will be readings from Seattle poet Samar Abulhassan, eight rounds of trivia, and a set from comedian Wilfred Padua.

Dear Cienna,
I’ve published a couple of sci-fi novels — probably nothing you’ve heard of. But every once in a while I’ll do a reading, and then comes the time to sign the books.
