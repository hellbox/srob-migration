        <div class="content">
          Bellingham poet Robert Lashley is probably best known for his stage presence. Lashley comes from the spoken word scene, and he is one of the best readers in the region: there’s a moment in every one of his performances when he shifts from mild-mannered stage patter to the poet with that voice, and it’s always a bracing moment.
You can always tell when someone in the audience has never attended a Lashley reading before because they rear up when that voice makes itself known.

          We think of books not as commodities but as symbols of individuality. But centuries before the Industrial Revolution, printing presses were mass-producing books. In fact, books are the first item that we mass-produced as a species, and we’ve gotten really good at making sure that every copy of a specific book is exactly the same as every other copy.
Part of the reason Jeff Bezos chose books as the commodity on which to establish his online retailing venture was the fact that books, as products, are so uniform.

          When the doctor holds my upper arm in his two hands,
he bows his head and listens as if he were waiting to hear
the song of a rare endemic bird no one has seen for centuries.
I start to speak, but he shakes his head, does not loosen his grip
on my arm, turns his fingers around the curve
of my skin and listens again.
I am afraid to clear my throat.

        <div class="content">
          Every year, the Hugo Awards announcement arrives with some dumb intercenine politics. Every year a small number of alt-right self-publishers try to game the ballot. Every year, they lose the awards. Every year, people call for the Hugos to change the way nominees are chosen. Every year the Hugos don&rsquo;t really change a thing.
This year, there are fewer of the alt-right on the nominee slate, but they&rsquo;re still there. Let&rsquo;s not let those jackasses obscure the fact that some great books are on this list, including Charlie Jane Anders&rsquo;s terrific debut novel All the Birds in the Sky.

Sponsor Eric Andrews-Katz's newly released novel Tartarus is a great romp through time, mythology, epic battles, and gay romance. Two siblings, descendants of Olympus, are dragged into ancient battles they didn't know they were responsible for.
It&rsquo;s a bold, entertaining work with an engaging story that bridges the old and the very new. We&rsquo;ve got a full chapter on our Sponsor&rsquo;s page for you to read, and find yourself gripped by this story.

        <div class="content">
          Bruja is the Spanish word for witch, and it’s possible that the witch in Wendy C. Ortiz’s latest book is Wendy herself. Not only does Ortiz watch a cheetah chasing a possum through a window, she manages to catch a bear whispering into the ear of another bear, and she is present while a sea turtle turns into a seal. She survives several shark attacks, jumps into a car that flies over rooftops, has an affair with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and attempts to murder her mother.

        <div class="content">
          Over the weekend, some comments made at a sales conference by Marvel Comics&rsquo;s Senior VP of Sales, David Gabriel, set the internet on fire. Gabriel was referring to a recent sales slump for Marvel books, and he seemed to place the entire blame for the slump on Marvel&rsquo;s attempts at diversity:
What we heard was that **people didn’t want any more diversity. They didn’t want female characters out there**. That’s what we heard, whether we believe that or not.
