          &ldquo;Nearly every woman I know has either had an abortion or helped another woman get one,&rdquo; begins the latest post on local author Lesley Hazleton&rsquo;s blog. Hazleton is a brilliant writer, a fearless thinker, and a deeply compassionate human being, and in this post she puts all those qualities to the service of one important cause. Hazleton wants to &ldquo;break the weird veil of shame and secrecy that still hangs over the decision&rdquo; to have an abortion, &ldquo;even when abortion is legal.

          Earlier this month, at a progressive rally in downtown Seattle, I watched from across the street as hundreds of allegedly liberal Seattleites booed the suggestion that Black Lives Matter. I saw a middle-aged preppy married couple raise their middle fingers in the air during a moment of silence in memory of a young black man who was killed by police officer. I saw angry white grandmothers beg officers to arrest the two young black women who took the stage, and I heard a small group of hip Capitol Hill dudes, horrifyingly, chant “tase those cunts.

          Shelf Awareness published an account of two Washington state booksellers who recently had to close due to rampant wildfires. One of the bookstores, Winthrop&rsquo;s delightful Trail&rsquo;s End, is open again and &ldquo;plans to donate proceeds from coffee sales at its espresso bar to vetted fire relief funds.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re ever in the Methow Valley, you should go out of your way to visit Trail&rsquo;s End; it&rsquo;s a delightful and well-stocked little shop.

I am a novelist. Some have called me the novelist, but their approval means nothing to me. Likewise their approbation. But I age, as we all do, and, as we all do, I crave the succor of youth.

This morning, local author (and, full disclosure, my friend and former coworker) David Schmader [made an exciting announcement](https://twitter.com/davidschmader/status/636965842761027585): he’s the new creative director at the [Greater Seattle Bureau of Fearless Ideas](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/teri-hein-it-lsquohurts-a-littlersquo-to-split-from-826-national/). The BFI is a nonprofit writing and communications center — until last year, it was [known as 826 Seattle](http://fearlessideas.org/) — that offers writing workshops, tutoring assistance, field trips, and other writerly pursuits for Seattle-area youth. Schmader has for decades been a beloved fixture in Seattle’s writing scene; you may know him from his brilliant solo shows, or his insanely fun *Showgirls* screenings, or his brainstorming classes at Hugo House, or his Last Days column in *The Stranger*.

          Being an arachnophobe is popular. It seems to be completely within the realm of reason and decency to severely panic at the sight of a spider of any size. Adult human beings will recount stories of their terror without a hint of shame — sometimes it even seems they do so with pride. While some may capture the spider under a glass, barricade it within using a sheet of paper, and escort it outside, it can be safely assumed that every year millions of spiders are instead crushed upon sight.

          Every comics fan knows Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country. Thursday Comics Hangover is a weekly column reviewing some of the new books that I pick up at [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/), my friendly neighborhood comic book store.
For many years, the publishers of superhero comics tried to convince their readers that it was the characters that mattered most, not the creative teams behind the characters.

          Our bookstore of the month for August is Mercer Street Books. You may have read Paul&rsquo;s first three pieces on the store, from the previous Wednesdays of this month. He mentioned that owner Debbie Sarrow kindly agreed to be the mail-drop for SRoB, and to the cynical mind that might explain why we picked Mercer Street Books as our first pick: a little quid pro quo, right?
What it doesn&rsquo;t say, though, is why we asked Debbie if she&rsquo;d agree to help us in the first place.
