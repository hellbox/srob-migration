        <div class="content">
          Our January bookstore of the month is Ballard’s own Push/Pull Art &amp; Illustration Studio &amp; Gallery, a cooperative space that launched out of a successful Kickstarter campaign last summer. Push/Pull is a gallery space devoted to art and comics and it’s also an underground comics store, with roughly 60 titles, and many more on the way. (You can see a small collection of the zines and comics, including one titled Those Fucking Dinosaurs, on their retail site.

        <div class="content">
          This morning, the comics internet blew up when the long list for this year&rsquo;s prestigious French comics award, the Grand Prix d’Angouleme, was announced. The list of 30 candidates did not include one single female cartoonist. And in case your first instinct was to mansplain this fact away — &rdquo;durr, but maybe no woman produced a comic worthy of awards this year,&rdquo; I can hear the gamergate crowd grumbling, as though that made any sense at all — you should bear in mind that in the Grand Prix&rsquo;s 43 years, only one woman has ever won the award.

        <div class="content">
          As you likely already know, the Hugo House building will be torn down this spring and a six-story mixed-use development will be built on the site. The Hugo House is scheduled to reopen in the new building sometime in 2018. (Mary Ann Gwinn published a preview of the new House in the Seattle Times last week.) But until today, we didn’t know where the House would be operating during the interim.

          Long shot prairie
Long shot wolf
Long shot girl
Long shot deer
Long shot dog
Close-up shot little monkey
My dear sweetheart,
Where does the North begin?
Wolfang, Fang, Flash and Flame
My darling cotton wooly hotel
A tiny house is expensive
At the edge of the sea
What is happiness, Love?
My dear sweetheart&mdash;
HUNGRY WOLVES SURROUND THE CAMP

          Heading east for the American Library Association Midwinter meeting in Boston? Are you interested in the future of books and reading? Check out the CODEX hackathon over at the MIT Media Lab January 8-10.
The concept of a hackathon may seem daunting if you&rsquo;re not a developer or designer, but really, don&rsquo;t be intimidated. Typically, small groups of people are put together to work a problem, or respond to a conceptual prompt.

          We&rsquo;re so excited about our first sponsor of 2016. Mineral School is an overnight artist&rsquo;s residency situated in an old elementary school in Mineral, Washington. It&rsquo;s in the foothills of Mount Rainier, an idyllic and perfect setting for an artist focusing on getting some work done. If two weeks dedicated to your writing in an amazing setting with delicious food provided seems like a dream to you, then you should get your application in as soon as you can.

        <div class="content">
          Today, Nick Licata is retiring from the Seattle City Council after four terms. He leaves behind a very impressive legacy. Licata was the most progressive member of the council at a time when Seattle was experimenting with a very prickly east coast version of urbanism, exemplified by Mark Sidran’s atrocious civility laws and Joe Mallahan’s dumb corporate paternalism. And the council that is being sworn in today is more liberal, in part, because of Licata’s tireless advocacy for liberal causes.
