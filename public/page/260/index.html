Wait a gosh-darn minute. That top one doesn&rsquo;t feel like a book. The weight is all wrong.

It kind of looks like it will open up.

Wow! It&rsquo;s a game! How interesting.

          From the AP:
South Korean author Han Kang has won the Man Booker International Prize for fiction with "*The Vegetarian*," an unsettling novel in which a woman's decision to stop eating meat has devastating consequences. Kang is the first South Korean author to be nominated for the Man Booker. The book was translated from the Korean by Deborah Smith.

          Sponsor Lisa Richesson has an incredible story to tell in her book White Lady, Black Sons, one that explains Seattle&rsquo;s racist past through her direct experience. Lisa, a white woman, had two children with a black man. One, when she was a teenager, was put up for adoption.
The first chapter of the book, which you can read on our Sponsor&rsquo;s page, goes back even earlier to the first time she became aware of race, and just what happened in her cloistered white Catholic community when she became friends with a young black girl.

          Are you interested in Lindy West the person? Or are you interested in the feminist issues Lindy West frequently discusses, such as fat acceptance? That answer will tell you how much you’ll enjoy her new book Shrill.
I went into Shrill expecting a book making the case for feminist causes. As a professional, West is primarily known for that work, such as her wildly viral Jezebel piece, “How to Make a Rape Joke.

          I came to Geek Love late in life — just a couple of years ago when I was 36, as I tackled edits on my own novel. I’d heard of Katherine Dunn for years, of course, but I was totally surprised by the weirdness in her work. Everything in Geek Love felt like a madwoman’s treasure hunt, complete with freaks, carnivals, flippers, Siamese twins, fetish strip clubs, and — yowzah — limb amputation.

          As I said in my introductory Bookstore of the Month piece about Queen Anne Book Company, the store is relatively small when compared to some of Seattle’s other neighborhood bookstores, but its stock seems remarkably deep, as though it’s got the stock of a bookstore two to four times the size squeezed inside of it. It’s the kind of store that leaves you marveling at how much they do have, which is essential for a bookstore; those stores that leave you marveling at what they don’t carry do not tend to last that long.

        <div class="content">
          This is a big one: Seattle author Elissa Washuta is receiving $25,000 in no-strings-attached funds for the Artist Trust 2016 Arts Innovator Award. (The other AIA winner this year is performer, writer, and musician Ahamefule J. Oluo, who will also probably write a book one day.) It&rsquo;s been a big year for Washuta, who also recently won the Fremont Bridge Writer-in-Residence title.
Along with the announcement of the award, Artist Trust announced that The Dale and Leslie Chihuly Foundation have committed to continue funding the Arts Innovator Award for another three years, through 2019.
