        <div class="content">
          If you&rsquo;re in the Orthodox church, Easter is still ahead, on May 1st this year. We&rsquo;re welcoming back sponsor Charlotte Riggle, whose children&rsquo;s book Catherine&rsquo;s Pascha follows a little girl&rsquo;s quest to stay awake for the overnight Pascha, or Easter, service.
If you&rsquo;re not Orthodox, maybe you&rsquo;ll be wondering why the family next door are loading up the car with sleepy children all dressed up come April 30th. This book is a great way of understanding the faith of your neighbors and friends, and introducing children to the many ways that different people in the world worship.

          Singapore is especially difficult for Westerners to understand. People who visit come back like a blind man from the parable of the elephant, convinced that the trunk they felt represents the whole of the place.
Infamously, William Gibson wondered where the underground was when he visited in 1993 and wrote his Wired essay &ldquo;Disneyland with the Death Penalty&rdquo;. He lamented, among other things, the loss of the red light district.

As Open Books owner John Marshall prepares his poetry bookstore for a new owner and a new future, he can’t help but reflect on the past. Between the old friends sending their best wishes on news of Marshall’s retirement and the prospect of retirement, he describes himself as feeling a little “sentimental.”
“I’m getting lovely memories,” Marshall says. In particular, he’s been remembering some of the liveliest events Open Books has hosted over the last two decades.

          The Voyeur's Motel Let&rsquo;s talk about Gay Talese. When asked last week to name female journalists he admired, he balked, then doubled-down. Not using Twitter, or any social media, a New York Times piece reported that Talese was unaware of the controversy his words inspired until informed a few days later. After that reporting, the New York Times Public Editor responded to the Time&rsquo;s executive editor Dean Baquet talking smack about the very artice.

          Over at The Inlander, I wrote a piece about Seattle memoirist Elissa Washuta, who&rsquo;ll be reading at Get Lit!, Spokane&rsquo;s wonderful annual book festival. We talked about the distinction of being a memoirist versus being an essayist, whether people got mad at Washuta for the way they were presented in her memoir, and what the most surprising thing about publishing a memoir. I love introducing Seattle&rsquo;s authors to new audiences; I hope you&rsquo;ll go take a look at the piece.
