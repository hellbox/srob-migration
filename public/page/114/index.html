        <div class="content">
          Yesterday, a Redditor by the user name of FatuousJeffrey posted that the Half Price Books in the University District on Roosevelt Way was scheduled to close in April of this year. FatuousJeffrey attributed this news to “a clerk I talked to last night.” That Half Price Books has been operating for at least a quarter-century, and it was a rare familiar presence through all the development the Roosevelt neighborhood has seen in recent years.

You&rsquo;ve likely read something in the last month about Emil Ferris&rsquo;s stellar graphic novel My Favorite Thing Is Monsters, which was just published by Fantagraphics Books. NPR&rsquo;s John Powers explains the story of how Ferris came to create the book:
 She was a 40-year-old single mom who supported herself doing illustrations when she was bitten by a mosquito, she contracted West Nile virus, became paralyzed from the waist down, and lost the use of her drawing hand.
