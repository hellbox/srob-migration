  Standing on the northeast corner of Third and Stewart, looking south on Third, one sees a sky bridge. It connects a parking garage to the building that once housed The Bon Marché, one of three powerhouse retailers that bounded out of the wellspring of Seattle in the olden days.

          We at the Seattle Review of Books aren&rsquo;t attending the Association of Writers &amp; Writing Programs (AWP) conference in Washington DC, but we&rsquo;ve been following along on social media as the Seattle contingent of attendees represents us in readings and at conferences. They&rsquo;re doing us proud!
Unfortunately, AWP management doesn&rsquo;t seem to be rising to the occasion. We&rsquo;ve seen several Facebook posts complaining about a failure to provide accessibility for the disabled, particularly with power doors onsite at the Washington [DC] Convention Center that don&rsquo;t open at the push of a button.

Dear Cienna,
The other day at the eye doctor’s office, I found myself considering a pince nez. Would this make me look like a total ass, or is it time for FDR’s preferred eyewear to make a comeback?

Friday February 10th **Bushwick Book Club: Americanah**
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Americanah is one of the greatest novels to be published in the last five years. Actually, probably the last decade. Maybe the last 25 years? Seems likely. Tonight, Seattle musicians present new work based on the most recent Greatest American Novel.

Love Makes Our Worlds Go Round The first story published in the SFFH series I mentioned last month, the Slate Magazine series on life under Presiden Trump, is a love story: Hector Tobar’s “The Daylight Underground.” Love moves the immoveable, and SFFH is rife with its primal and paradoxical power.

Early in Sexcastle, a random goon threatens Shane Sexcastle by asking, &ldquo;You ever hear the phrase &lsquo;You brought a knife to a gun fight?&rsquo;&rdquo;
Sexcastle responds, &ldquo;This is worse than that. You brought a you to a me fight.&rdquo;
Sexcastle was first published almost two years ago, but it had escaped my attention until the good folks at Phoenix Comics turned me on to it last night. I was interested in an upcoming comic called Rock Candy Mountain about a hobo’s epic journey by a cartoonist named Kyle Starks, and they happened to have his first book in stock.
