        <div class="content">
          M.A.Orthofer at the Literary Saloon notes that the New York Times has consolidated all of its book review coverage — in the daily paper and in the The New York Times Book Review — under the purview of Pamela Paul. It&rsquo;s perhaps easy to bemoan every new change in the world of journalism as a mistake, but, uh, I think this is a mistake.
One of the consistent pleasures of reading the New York Times was finding book reviews in the paper that disagreed with book reviews in the Book Review.

        <div class="content">
          This morning, Gawker.com — the popular news site that started as a publishing industry gossip blog — confirmed rumors that it will shut down next week. This would be a great time to read Brian Abrams&rsquo;s ebook Gawker: An Oral History, which was published last summer. I reviewed that book when it was released last year.

        <div class="content">
          Above all else, most superhero comics should aim to be entertaining. Sure, it’s nice if you get some commentary in there, or a little bit of a political message, but superheroes aren’t the ideal messengers for heavy themes. (Sorry, people who think The Dark Knight Returns counts as deep political satire.) By the entertainment-per-page ratio, Portland author Chelsea Cain’s run on the Mockingbird series for Marvel is leading the superhero pack these days.

        <div class="content">
          This is not the first time this has happened:
Barnes & Noble just unceremoniously ousted Ronald Boire as CEO, saying that the board has deemed him “not a good fit for the organization and that it was in the best interests of all parties for him to leave the Company.” Boire was at the top of the chain book retailer for less than a year. This puts longtime Barnes &amp; Noble leader Leonard Riggio back in charge of the chain that he founded in 1965 and has led, on-and-off, ever since.

        <div class="content">
          Luna, Alice, and Saraphina fill the stage with both humor and anguish. Three friends living in the same building, they work on their downward dog together and help each other through life’s daily struggles. The performance in 9 Ounces presented the separate monologues of these three black women — each one an act and each role performed by Anastacia Renee Tolbert, the Hugo House&rsquo;s current poet-in-residence. In part, the characters serve to represent the span of life and its various stages through their age differences: Luna is a kid, Alice an adult, and Saraphina a 91-year-old widow.
