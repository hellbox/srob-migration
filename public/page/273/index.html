        <div class="content">
          The 2016 Eisner Award nominations have been announced — the Eisners are basically the Oscars of comic books — and Seattle is well-represented this year. Fantagraphics Books is the most-nominated company of the year, with a whopping 17 nods. (One of Fantagraphics&rsquo; most-nominated titles is The Eternaut, which I reviewed here at the Seattle Review of Books back in December.)
Other Seattle-area nominees include The Oatmeal&rsquo;s Matthew Inman, who was nominated for his strip &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Going to Be Okay,&rdquo; and G.

          Taking my knife to the sharpener
I had to ask my brother
how do I take a knife
to the sharpener
one chance not to ruin
the flesh of this tuna I wanted
to separate the head
and dissolve the eye into
powder on my tongue I said
something about a fire worried
about dying in a fire in this club
with these people she said
“Where I come from that isn’t funny”

          Hugo House has published a (PDF) Frequently Asked Questions sheet explaining what their last month of operations in the Capitol Hill building will be like. There will be a large party on May 7th in which people will be invited to write on the walls of the House, and there will be a Literary Series event on the 20th — the theme is &ldquo;The Writing on the Wall,&rdquo; cleverly enough — that is slated to be the final event.

          Imagine your mind connected with others in such an intimate, seamless way that you became one person with many bodies. This is the basis of sponsor Steve Toutonghi&rsquo;s exciting new Science Fiction thriller Join. We&rsquo;ve got the first chapter on our sponsor&rsquo;s page, and there&rsquo;s no way we&rsquo;re gonna stop reading there — and we bet you&rsquo;ll be just like us.
Steve is throwing a launch party this Thursday, April 21st at the Queen Anne Book Company.

          I stop at Mercer Street Books to pick up the review copy of Lunatics, Lovers and Poets. Where to read it? Which restaurant? Where? Too many cars, too loud, I don’t want to cross the street. Irish pub? No, it’s too dark, too much dark wood, in the middle of our block I avoid the selva oscura. Floyd’s! Floyd’s? It’s gone! How about Mecca, that’ll work, but that’s all the way round.

Of course, there’s more to a bookstore than readings. As John Marshall reflects on his time with Open Books, he’s been thinking about how much he’s learned from his customers. “I have been educated in so many directions by articulate folks possessing a vast array of aesthetics,” he says. He learns about poets and events from customers all the time, and all those many voices have helped make Open Books a two-decade conversation, with the kind of “crackling moments of wit,” he says, “that make life glow.
