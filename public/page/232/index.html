        <div class="content">
          The new documentary Finding Babel opens with the construction of a statue of the author Isaac Babel. Scenes of the statue being sculpted are intercut with an introduction to Babel’s grandson, Andrei Maleev-Babel. We spend the rest of the film with Maleev-Babel as he he travels the world trying to discover the truth about his grandfather’s past.
As Maleev-Babel follows his grandfather’s footsteps, Finding Babel unspools in a chorus of voices.

        <div class="content">
          It’s perhaps a gross generalization to say that most novelists don’t understand quantum physics, but it is a generalization that I feel confident standing behind. You’ll see certain well-worn scientific oversimplifications dragged out again and again in fiction: the idea of light being both particle and wave, depending on how you observe it; the fact that gravity is dependent on mass; and the idea that there are countless parallel universes out there, a multiverse where every world you can imagine is true.

Last week, Marvel Comics published the first issue of a comic book titled Captain America: Steve Rogers by writer Nick Spencer and artist Jesus Saiz. At the end of the comic — uh, spoilers, I guess — the superhero Captain America is revealed to have always been a double-agent of Hydra, a super-villain analog to the Nazis. (You can read an explainer here.) People on the internet wrote a lot of posts and tweets and Facebook updates expressing their dismay about the reveal.

Hi! I was in your beautiful city the weekend of May 20 and seem to have misplaced an incredibly important notebook in that time. Have you seen it? It's a 5-star Mead composition notebook with a white plastic-y cover with folder inlay. On the inside you will see an index and then headings like "

          Well, this is huge.
Now after 13 years of remarkable rewards, a ton of laughs, hard work, good cheer, and so many remarkable children and families in my life, I’m ready to start new projects, write new stories, and make time for yet more fearless adventures.
The timing is right. We have weathered some big changes in the organization and will be returning to our remodeled post-gas-explosion site in a few weeks.
