          Just got an email from the Zine Archive and Publishing Project&rsquo;s Managing Director, Graham Isaac regarding ZAPP&rsquo;s closure. It&rsquo;s billed as an &ldquo;Official PR statement.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re reprinting the statement in its entirety, using their bolds. There has been one update to the statement, which I detail below in an update on this post.
**Effective immediately Seattle Public Library will be taking over storage, programming, and access to ZAPP's collection of over 30,000 zines.

          Judge Neil Gorsuch, in his Supreme Court nomination hearings today, quoted David Foster Wallace&rsquo;s most famous commencement speech to explain the ubiquity of law. (It&rsquo;s kind of a dumb and basic interpretation of the speech, if you ask me, but whatever.) Justice Antonin Scalia was also a DFW fan. What&rsquo;s the connection between conservative judges and the work of David Foster Wallace? It must the tennis, right? Yeah, it&rsquo;s gotta be the tennis.

          Cartoonists don’t often get a chance at second acts. We expect comics artists to keep drawing the same immortal characters over and over until they grow old and die, like Charles Schulz; or until they retire from the business, like Gary Larson; or until they perfect their art and ascend to the literary heavens, like Lynda Barry.
Tacoma cartoonist Peter Bagge, then, is the great exception. His semi-autobiographical Buddy Bradley comics — partially canonized last year in the deluxe two-volume reprint collection The Complete Neat Stuff — is largely considered one of the cornerstones of 1990s alternative comics.

          Just because I can now trap a spider
between cup and paper and set it free
doesn’t mean I’m no longer afraid.
Just because I sometimes believe
in the divine doesn’t mean I don’t see emptiness every time I close my eyes.
The man down the street
has made a home out of things
I’ve thrown out:
used retail bags, duck-taped and stretched, keep the rain at bay, old clothes

Just got an email from ZAPP, the Zine Archive and Publishing Project, that the organization is finally folding.
The zine collection will be in good hands, at the CEN branch of Seattle Public Library.
The independent nonprofit called ZAPP will cease programming and has found worthy places to donate their remaining budget.

Our sponsor, Friends' of the UW Libraries, gala event "Literary Voices", on May 3rd, is one of those amazing, inspiring events that are too far and too few between on our literary calendars. This year, they've got a keynote address by the inimitable Annie Proulx, author of _The Shipping News_, _Barkskins_, and the short story "Brokeback Mountain". The event is a fundraiser that pays directly for student employee scholarships. You are either helping to create the librarians of tomorrow, or get the librarians of today the support they need to run one of the most robust, impressive University library systems on the West Coast.

Once in a while, I take a new book with me to lunch and give it a half an hour or so to grab my attention. **Lunch Date** is my judgment on that speed-dating experience.
**Who’s your date today?** *Him, Me, Muhammad Ali*, by Randa Jarrar.
**Where’d you go?** The [Chaco Canyon Organic Café](http://www.chacocanyoncafe.com/about-us/) in West Seattle.
**What’d you eat?** I had the smoky yam and kale quinoa bowl($9.95) and a cup of coffee.

        <div class="content">
          One day, Jamaica Baldwin’s name just started popping up everywhere in Seattle literary circles. Two years ago, I had never seen her name before. Then from out of the blue in January of 2016 came this tweet from Kwame Dawes:
Remember this name: JAMAICA BALDWIN. A poet of power will cross your path soon.
&mdash; Kwame Dawes (@kwamedawes) January 8, 2016 And then Baldwin was everywhere at once. She was part of the exclusive Margin Shift poetry collective’s reading series and the 2016 Lit Crawl and seemingly everywhere else in the Seattle literary scene.
