          **Wednesday March 8th: *Native Seattle* Reading**
Coll Thrush, a professor at the University of British Columbia, has two new books out. The first, *Indigenous London*, looks pretty neat. But we’re most interested in the new edition of *Native Seattle*, his history of Seattle’s native peoples. Today, Crosscut’s Knute Berger will interview Thrush about both books. *Folio: The Seattle Athenaem, 324 Marion St., 402-4612, http://folioseattle.org. $10. 7 p.m.* ![](/webhook-uploads/1488582134310/toughgirl.jpeg)

          Kevin Craft is one of the hardest-working people in Seattle literature. As a teacher, he works on literary programs at Everett Community College and University of Washington. As an editor, he ran Poetry Northwest magazine for seven years and has compiled five anthologies. As a publisher he just built a new press, Poetry Northwest Editions, that will launch with a new collection from Sierra Nelson this year. And as a writer, he’s.

        <div class="content">
          It seems that nearly every page of Seattle author Kevin Emerson’s young adult science fiction novel Last Day on Mars has a blinking light on it. Since the book takes place on a Mars colony in the far-flung year of 2213, most of the lights are on console panels or spacefaring equipment. There are some signal lights, too, and a few twinkling stars. But the book is really about one giant blinking light: the sun, billions of years ahead of schedule, is about to go supernova and then collapse, rendering our solar system inhospitable.

          &ldquo;A branch of the Seattle Public Library is named after two African-American icons who never set foot in the Pacific Northwest,&rdquo; begins this report by historian Feliks Banel at MyNorthwest.com. The branch in question, of course, is the The Douglass-Truth Library.
 Ijeoma Oluo needs your help to keep her site The Establishment running:
  It has been life-affirming to see so many writers bless us with some of their first professionally published pieces — women writers of color, trans writers, queer writers, disabled writers — talking about some of the most important issues of the day with actual lived experience.

          My father was de-boned as a child.
The trick was to use a sharp knife,
steady hands and always begin at the neck. With luck, my grandparents
were able to remove his spine intact.
But all-muscle can’t hold love upright.
You see strength needs something
to settle itself around. Boneless men
can only stay where they are bent to.
My father was made to cut
his own beatings off a tree,
