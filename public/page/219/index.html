          Here, in two easy steps, is the secret to succeeding in Seattle:
 First, tell everyone you know about what you’re planning to do. Then, actually do it.  Number two is the most crucial part, obviously. Seattle’s writers and artists are drowning in aspiration; everyone has an idea of what they’d do with unlimited time and resources. They’d write a book, they’d start a citywide conversation about a topic that really matters to them, they’d build a community around a gallery or store or event.

          The fact that Elie Wiesel passed away on the same weekend that Donald Trump tweeted a barely coded anti-Semitic graphic from a white supremacist group was more than just unfortunate timing: it served as a reminder that we need writers and advocates and witnesses like Wiesel in our public sphere more than ever. He will be missed.
 The American Poetry Review just announced that Seattle author Jane Wong won the Stanley Kunitz Memorial Prize for her poem &ldquo;I Put On My Fur Coat.

          I have this notion that if you live long enough,
there are three or four great stories that you will have in your life.
A story of a journey or a transformation.
A story of love, which will likely mean the loss of love, a story
of loss. And a story of spiritual illumination,
which, for many, will probably be the moment of death itself,
the story untellable, its beginning and middle

 Now: we&rsquo;re taking the day off, but we don&rsquo;t want to leave you in the lurch for summer reading, so we thought we&rsquo;d share Queen Anne Book Company&rsquo;s page for the McClure Middle School&rsquo;s summer reading program. We wish this was our required reading in 6th grade.

          5 Reasons Why Moby-Dick Just Won’t Die Thankfully, my high school English teacher decided we’d skip the technical chapters on how to behead a whale. But Mark Beauregard explains why Melville’s Moby Dick as a whole is still relevant 165 years later.
 To be an American in 2016 is to feel threatened from within and without. We have anxiety about our role in the world and our responsibilities to other Americans, which some people want to solve by electing a monomaniacal Captain Ahab (Trump) to take the helm and some people want to solve by electing a radical populist Ishmael (Sanders).
