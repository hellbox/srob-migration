          People ask me all the time how I read so much. They usually don&rsquo;t like my answer: I don&rsquo;t watch as much TV as the typical person, and I don&rsquo;t play video games. There&rsquo;s no easy quick-fix, besides the fact that you have to make time in life for the things that you really value.
With that in mind, I&rsquo;d like to direct your attention to this Harvard Business Review piece by Hugh McGuire, titled &ldquo;How Making Time for Books Made Me Feel Less Busy.

          I&rsquo;m a big fan of Jess Walter and Sherman Alexie&rsquo;s podcast, A Tiny Sense of Accomplishment. Many conversational podcasts don&rsquo;t work because they feel unstructured, but Tiny regularly delivers smart and funny conversation on a few tightly focused subjects.
Just this morning, a very special episode of Tiny was published. This one was taped live at Bumbershoot a week or so ago, and it features special musical guests Rachel Flotard and Neko Case.

(*Every comics fan knows that Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country.* Thursday Comics Hangover *is a weekly column reviewing some of the books I pick up at [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/), my friendly neighborhood comic book store.*)
In nerd vernacular, the phrase “Hey, kids! Comics!” has taken on a couple of disparate meanings. It originated as a sign on the top of drugstore comics spinner racks (some iterations of the sign were paired with another sign that read “Wholesome entertaining comics”).

          Alex de Campi&rsquo;s critically acclaimed Wonder Woman comic, Sensation Comics, is being canceled. DC Comics has moved the separate ongoing Wonder Woman comic, which is terrible, under the Superman editorial banner. On her blog, de Campi makes pubic some gossip that&rsquo;s been writhing just under the surface of the comics industry for decades now:
Now, the Superman office allegedly employs no women, and a cursory glance over the mastheads of several Superman titles and Wonder Woman seems to confirm that allegation.

          The Asian-American Writers Workshop has published an anthology of essays (self-described as &ldquo;a Forum&rdquo;) titled &ldquo;After Yi-Fen Chou.&rdquo; In it, 19 Asian-American authors respond to the Best American Poetry 2015 controversy. Some of the pieces are hilarious. Many are furious at Michael Derrick Hudson for submitting work under the name Yi-Fen Chou. Others are furious at the book&rsquo;s editor, Sherman Alexie, for choosing to leave the poem in the anthology after he discovered that Hudson had appropriated another culture to submit his work.

          Mark your calendars for Thursday, October 22nd — that&rsquo;s the date for Lit Crawl Seattle, the annual three-part literary pub crawl that happens all over downtown, Capitol Hill, and First Hill. Organizers at Lit Crawl just announced their full schedule and it&rsquo;s ridiculously packed with local talent. There are scores of readers — somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 — and dozens of readings to suit just about every literary taste.

          JB Dickey happened to walk into the Seattle Mystery Bookshop on the day that they received their first order of books from late, lamented west coast distributor Pipeline in 1990. There were boxes everywhere. He made a deal with Seattle Mystery founder Bill Farley: “I traded him work for store credit” on that first day, Dickey says, and “a few weeks later, I ended up starting with him part-time so he could do other, non-bookselling things.

          I was so excited to report the Man Booker Shortlist names (and the attendant Seattle connection) yesterday that I completely failed to follow the advice of Seattle author Nicola Griffith: I didn&rsquo;t count the number of women&rsquo;s voices on the list. Luckily, Griffith did do a gender count, and she finds the results to be &ldquo;appalling.&rdquo; There are fewer women on the shortlist than usual, she says, and very few of the books are about the experiences of women.
