          The nature of work has changed significantly in the last 50 years, and it’s frankly kind of amazing that there’s not rioting in the streets over it. Think about it: at one point in American history, employers were expected to offer full-time jobs with benefits and a retirement program. Fewer and fewer Americans ever enjoy that kind of a relationship, and the rush into piecework only gains speed with the passage of time.

        <div class="content">
          News broke yesterday that author William Trevor passed away. Literary Hub has a wonderful roundup of audio and visual files of Trevor appearances and remembrances of Trevor by other authors.
 Sadly appropriate for our time: Umberto Eco&rsquo;s list of 14 common features of fascism. Here&rsquo;s number seven:
  The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.

          If a tree falls in the woods
And no one is there to hear it
Does it even make a sound?
Alternative version:
If a police officer shoots a black kid
and no one saw the bullet
Is the black kid really dead?
If a white man goes on a killing spree is he a terrorist?
Or mentally ill?
Or a wolf in white skin?
If the black kid does not get a hashtag

Our inspiring sponsor, Susan Marie Conrad, did something many of us want to do, but almost nobody does: she kayaked the entire Inside Passage, from Anacortes to Juneau, Alaska. You and I both know this story is more than just the logistics of paddling, and Conrad delivers a great story in her book _Inside: One Woman’s Journey Though the Inside Passage_. It's well-told, rife with personal accomplishment, and that kind of self-examination that only comes from pitting oneself against nature.

          Chaim Gartenberg at The Verge writes about the really neat idea behind Recommendmeabook.com:
Designed by developer Givi Phirtskhalava, the site presents you with the first page of a novel as a blank, standalone item without title, author, or cover, allowing you to experience the beginning of a book without coloring it with any preconceived ideas. You just read the first page and if you like it, you push a button to reveal the title and author.
