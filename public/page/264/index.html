On Saturday, hundreds of people flooded into the Hugo House to take part in a public celebration of one of the most important literary spaces in Seattle. Though the House will host a few more literary events between now and the old building&rsquo;s demolition, Saturday&rsquo;s party certainly marked some sort of an end. Someone described it to me as a wake, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem quite right; I&rsquo;ve never been to a wake where they played AC/DC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thunderstruck&rdquo; at high volume.

          There has been a bookstore on top of Queen Anne hill almost continuously since 1998. Queen Anne Books, the bookstore that was the precursor to (our Bookstore of the Month) Queen Anne Book Company, changed hands once since its founding and moved roughly half a block north. Three years ago, the store closed for several months before reopening under the slightly modified name and new ownership. One of the points of continuity between Queen Anne Books and Queen Anne Book Company was bookseller Wendee Wieking, who has been working for the organization since 2007.

        <div class="content">
          This past Saturday, Independent Bookstore Day, I interviewed author Shann Ray onstage at [Phinney Books]( http://www.phinneybooks.com/) as part of the ongoing [Dock Street Salon](http://dockstreetpress.com/) reading series. It is impossible to talk about Shann Ray without using sentences that go galumphing off into a long series of ands. Watch this: Shann Ray writes poems and non-fiction, and fiction about masculinity, bar fights, and forgiveness. His debut novel, *American Copper*, was praised by no less a Seattle luminary than Sherman Alexie as “tough, poetic, and beautiful.
