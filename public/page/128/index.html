          If I had to choose one, and only one, writer to help me navigate the world for the rest of my life, my choice would probably be Rebecca Solnit. Solnit is a considerate, intelligent writer; sometimes when you read her essays you can feel your own brain changing and growing to accept new information about the world. And she’s also got the power to direct the very flow of popular culture; her essay “Men Explain Things to Me” is widely regarded as the source of the word “mansplaining.

This newspaper article, written exactly 36 years ago, marks the beginning of my immigration story. Those people in the picture are my parents and my sister. I am the one sitting, with my fists turned awkwardly in the foreground. When the photo was taken we had been in the US exactly 13 days. Before that we survived in a war zone.

          (After Soujourner Truth’s speech, Ain’t I a woman?)
There is so much turmoil in our country of late, something must be terribly wrong.
There is a man over there, who occupies the highest office in the land, who says immigrants are rapists, criminals, the worst kind of people.
I have never committed a crime, have paid taxes every year of my adult life, and have worked to earn an honest wage!

          Let me tell you about the place I come from, the ragged-road Texas
where every gas station means hot breakfast tacos wrapped in foil,
and every summer means brisket cooked so slow it falls apart,
because everything worth doing is worth doing slow
unless it’s driving, or sex,
both of which we do young and fast until someone stops us,
except for me, who starts driving late and starts dating never

          Nobody writes about the Northwest like Jon Raymond. From his gorgeous short stories— *Livability* is one of the finest books about the region to be published in the last two decades —to screenplays for films like *Old Joy* and *Wendy and Lucy* to novels like *Rain Dragon*, he’s perfected the art of writing about the lush vividness of Northwest nature, the peculiar mannerisms of Northwest people, and the sprawling wet-concrete grace of Northwestern cities.
