          As you know, we at the Seattle Review of Books publish a poem by a Seattle poet every Tuesday at 10 am. We always ask the featured poet to then choose the poet who we’ll feature on the next Tuesday. It’s a chain of Seattle poetry, made up of friends, fans, and acquaintences who’ve shared some laughs on the open-mic circuit. When I asked Seattle literary demigod Sherman Alexie to kick off our spring/summer 2016 poetry chain, I was intensely curious to see who he’d choose as the poet to succeed him.

          Hunter S. Thompson&rsquo;s widow, Anita, just returned a pair of antlers that Thompson stole from Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s house about three years after Hemingway committed suicide. This story touches on so many high school boy writer wannabe zones of interest that it&rsquo;s not even funny: Thompson, Hemingway, theft, the ironic display of hunting trophies.
But let&rsquo;s be clear so all the wannabe gonzo journalists in the back can hear us: stealing objects from the home of your idols is not okay.

        <div class="content">
          When I talked with cartoonist Ted Rall at Town Hall last year, he openly discussed his legal troubles with the Los Angeles Times. His side of the story is around the 28 minute mark in the video below:
 Basically, Rall says that the chief of the LAPD and the editors of the LA Times colluded to fire him. Rall filed a suit against the Times to clear his name, which means he&rsquo;s now in direct combat with the much-loathed media conglomerate Tronc.

          &hellip;.Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell. A book club for Seahawks players is the idea of defensive end Michael Bennett, who got approval from management.

          From the other-sided, alee the valley; to give what you want &mdash;
says the mentor, irreparably. As pretense gets wrecked like a
photograph. As we haunt eternally.
It&rsquo;s hard to tell.
Do we?
Cold guy drifts in cold veins, this nightly swim.
So I overheard in LA, grab a shovel, LA is dead.
Nothing is Real. Lame,
I know. Ask if there&rsquo;s proof.
Of life, if not for death&rsquo;s warming the carpet living room.

          Seattle poet EJ Koh announced on Twitter that her poetry collection A Lesser Love has won the 2016 Pleiades Press Editors Prize for Poetry. The book will be published next year.
If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about Koh, we published her wonderful poem &ldquo;Korean War&rdquo; last fall, and she will be a featured reader — along with poet Robert Lashley and Seattle author Sherman Alexie — at the Seattle Review of Books reading at Bumbershoot this year.

          Sponsor Roy Lisker has done it all: he&rsquo;s a mathematician, political activist, underground journalist, prankster and provocateur, as well as playwright, poet, and writer of fiction. Sagging Meniscus Press has pulled together this first volume of Lisker&rsquo;s collected stories: &ldquo;We regard the publication of these stories, all together for the first time, as an important event in American letters.&rdquo;
We have the start of his story &ldquo;Amplitude of the Cosmos&rdquo; on our sponsor&rsquo;s page, and it&rsquo;s wonderful work, complex, rhythmic, with a melodic rhyme and lilt, a formalist repetition that provides mood and music in the prose.

          In the news business, they refer to the &ldquo;Friday evening news dump&rdquo; as the time when organizations — corporations, governments — release information that they don&rsquo;t want to get much attention. Friday evenings at 5 pm in the summer are generally when disgraced CEOs step down, when embarrassing statistics are released, when institutional shame is released into the world. Friday news dumps in August and December are especially notorious for this, because absolutely nobody pays attention to the news over the weekends in summer or the holiday season.
