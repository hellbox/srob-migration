          What We're Saying When We Talk About Hillary Clinton's "Likability" Sady Doyle unpacks the gendered responses to the first woman to be a major party candidate.
 No, Hillary Clinton is not a flawless person &mdash; or politician. You can complain about her secrecy, her hawkishness, or her husband all for good reason. But Clinton is, according to available biographical evidence, normal. Ordinary, even. She’s like countless women of her generation: Caught between the second wave of feminism and the marital norms of a pre-feminist age, driven to prove herself but cautious about seeming “pushy” or radical, aspiring to lead the nation into the 21st century yet baffled by her own fax machine.

Dear Cienna,
**I recently moved from Seattle to a small town in the Midwest, giving up the Seattle Public Library’s massive collection for something much more modest. Now, our library system here is pretty good!

          As Jennifer Schuessler reported in the New York Times, the MacArthur Foundation announced their annual &ldquo;Genius&rdquo; grant winners yesterday. I&rsquo;m very excited to see that the new list of &ldquo;Geniuses&rdquo; includes authors we&rsquo;ve written about here at the Seattle Review of Books over the past year.
 Willie Fitzgerald wrote a review incorporating Claudia Rankine&rsquo;s compelling poetry collection Citizen last year.
 The brilliant Maggie Nelson has been written about a few times here on the site, most notably in Cate McGehee&rsquo;s splendid review of The Argonauts and Jennifer Bernstein&rsquo;s review of, among other books, Nelson&rsquo;s The Art of Cruelty.

          New column! Every month, Daneet Steffens is going to uncover the latest goings on in mystery, suspense, and crime fiction. Welcome Daneet!
I’m delighted to be kicking off this column for the Seattle Review of Books during a month full of crime-fiction action. Bloody Scotland, Scotland’s International Crime Writing Festival, toasted its fourth year, crowning Christopher Brookmyre with the top McIlvanney Prize, and featuring the traditional England crime writers vs. Scottish crime writers football match (England won, 7-1).

          Sometimes you just fall in love with an artist’s work at first sight. That was what it was like for me reading the first issue of DC’s new Doom Patrol, which was published last week. I don’t know where Nick Derington comes from, but that two-page spread he drew that opens the issue, with a long, narrow panel of protagonist Casey Brinke driving an ambulance, is this kind of a moment for me.

          It feels like these are end times that we are living in. Black men are being murdered by police with impunity. Nationalist movements reminiscent of pre-WWII era fascism are cropping up all over the world. And we have somehow all become willing participants in a surveillance state, happily carrying around devices that track our every movement, and enable us to share intimate details for the state and corporations to monitor and mine.
