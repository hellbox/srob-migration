          The Face is a new series of book-length essays centered around an interesting theme: in each volume, an author writes about their own face. It’s an idea that at once seems expansive as the horizon and as claustrophobic as a broom closet. When meeting strangers, we look to their face for hints of inner character, but we also chastise people for being too narcissistic if they seem overly obsessed with their own appearance.

&mdash; Breaking News (@BreakingNews) April 21, 2016 I wanted to be a musician so bad. We&rsquo;d gather at my friend Randy&rsquo;s house, all of us fifteen or so. We&rsquo;d order pizza in, and we&rsquo;d watch Purple Rain on VHS. Maybe a dozen times, we played it. We talked about our band and how cool it was going to be.

It was kind of a boring new comics Wednesday from the mainstream publishers, so I decided to dive into the minicomics section of Phoenix Comics &amp; Games to see what local cartoonists are working on. Or, in one case, what local cartoonists were working on; I had never seen the 2014 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fanzine Notorious R.B.G. before, so it was new to me. (It also predated the 2015 Christmas bestseller Notorious R.

          Who would have thought? More people use public libraries when public libraries get more revenue. Maybe Seattle Public Library leadership should focus more on investment in the collection and less on pursuing an &ldquo;anti-book&rdquo; agenda?

          We told you about this a couple weeks ago, and thankfully sanity has prevailed:
The Tennessee House of Representatives failed Wednesday to override Gov. Bill Haslam’s veto of a bill to make the Bible the official state book.
Haslam, a Republican, vetoed the Bible bill last week, saying he felt the bill “trivializes the Bible.”

          Last week, I asked people to share their experience with this year&rsquo;s Emerald City Comicon. Over the last few days, I&rsquo;ve heard from local cartoonists, from comics professionals, and from people who attended the show as fans. From those conversations, a pattern has emerged.
People are, so far as I can tell, pretty happy with Emerald City Comicon, especially as compared with other large comic book conventions. In fact, the more conventions that someone attends every year, the more likely they are to appreciate ECCC.

          **Wednesday April 20: David Schmader **
It’s true that I worked with David Schmader for years at *The Stranger*, and it’s true that I’m proud to call him my friend. But there is a part of my brain — the part that tingles when it comes across a sufficiently beautiful sentence — that is still in awe of his writing ability. If you haven’t read his now-defunct Last Days column or seen his live *Showgirls* performance, you might think it’s hyperbole when I say that Schmader is the single funniest man I’ve ever met.

          Since August of 2014, co-founders Connor Guy and Alex Davis-Lawrence have published Moss, a self-described “Online Journal of the Northwest,” for free at mosslit.com. It’s a literary magazine that publishes quality longform fiction and non-fiction from, and interviews with, Northwest writers. Last week, Davis-Lawrence and Guy, announced that they were bringing on Spokane novelist Sharma Shields — author of the excellent The Sasquatch Hunter&rsquo;s Almanac — as a contributing editor, with a few more editors yet to be added.

        <div class="content">
          It’s a hateful job, delivering news of death: the fact of its very existence, its unexpected arrival, its sudden probability. It’s heavy enough just to describe how it feels for the whole idea to swirl in, like a loaded paintbrush tainting the water in a jar. In her latest memoir, What Comes Next and How to Like It, released in paperback today, Abigail Thomas reluctantly and humanely shoulders the job, “just poking at death with a long stick to see what happens.
