      <description>Novels are economic artifacts. Some of the greatest novels of all time - books by Dickens, Steinbeck, and Allison come immediately to mind -were lauded because the authors wrote beautifully and knowingly about the lives of poor people. But walk around a bookstore reading dust jackets today and you&amp;rsquo;ll see that an overwhelming majority of the novels that land on bestseller lists are about the middle class and the upper middle class.</description>

      <description>The last Saturday in this month, April 28th, is [Independent Bookstore Day](http://www.indiebookstoreday.com/) - a celebration of books and the small businesses that celebrate literary culture year round. We&#39;ll have a lot to say about Independent Bookstore Day over the course of the month, but we thought we&#39;d begin the conversation by talking with two owners of smaller local bookstores - Jenny Cole of Burien&#39;s [Page 2 Books](https://page2books.indielite.org/), and Annie Carl of Bothell&#39;s [Neverending Bookshop](http://www.</description>

      <description>Good writing elicits a feeling that the words on the page were always meant to be. Like a film, say, where you don&amp;rsquo;t see the thousands of hours and hundreds of people sweating over the details to make a product that feels effortless when projected. Both the writing and film share a secret: they are more than the sum of their parts, but they are made of only of their parts.</description>

      <description>The color in the room was yellow.
I donât know if I knew then why,
or that yellow is as much the color of nerves
as it is of cowardice, as I stood stiff-straight
in front of Father Panda and examined his face.
It was wide, porous, ruddy, full as a moon beneath
a wave of curly hair the color of the pews. We both wore white, he in his vestments,</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s what Lindy West had to say on Facebook about her April 15 show at Benaroya Hall: Huge news! I&amp;rsquo;m speaking at Benaroya Hall! All by myself! For a long time! WITH A HUMOROUS SLIDESHOW!
Frankly, she had us at &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m speaking&amp;rdquo;; by the end of that string of phrases, we were ready to see her twice. These are trying times, and they deserve to be skewered, as only Lindy West can.</description>

      <description>**Monday, April 9: *Make Trouble* Reading **
Cecile Richards is president of both the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Her book *Make Trouble* is about her life - protesting the Vietnam War as a child, growing up as the daughter of fabulous Texas governor Ann Richards, and fighting regressive anti-woman forces in her role at Planned Parenthood. Tonight, she&#39;ll be in conversation with Lindy West, who is having a big week â West is also interviewing author Samantha Irby at University Temple on Wednesday, April 11th, and she&#39;s headlining at Benaroya Hall on Sunday, an event that is our sponsorship this week.</description>

      <description>Portland author Julia Stoops started writing her debut novel Parts Per Million in 2002, when liberal America was trying in vain to keep President George W. Bush from going to war with Iraq. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to recall now, after Occupy and Black Lives Matter and the Women&amp;rsquo;s March and the March for our Lives, but 2002 made activism feel like a fool&amp;rsquo;s errand. It seemed - to me, anyway, and to many of my friends - that the age of protest had passed, and that the people were powerless in the face of such relentless evil.</description>

      <description>Every month, Olivia Waite pulls back the covers, revealing the very best in new, and classic, romance. We&#39;re extending a hand to you. Won&#39;t you take it? And if you&#39;re still not sated, there&#39;s always [the archives](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/kissing-books).
This month I intended to write something frothy about clothing in romance. About the linen and muslin and silk of historicals, the wool suits and high heels of contemporaries, the uniforms of sports romances, the dragon-scarred leathers of fantasy romance, or the nano-regulated synthetic fabrics of the future in SFR (sci-fi romance, for those in the know).</description>

      <description>I have written before about how much I detest Mark Millar&amp;rsquo;s Old Man Logan story. It&amp;rsquo;s the worst of modern superhero comics: cynical, try-hard, a crass rip-off of a significant pop cultural icon (Millar should have to pay royalty checks to Clint Eastwood for what he did to Unforgiven.) Somehow the series, which imagined Wolverine living in a dystopian future in which the Hulk breeds with his cousin to father a posse of inbred hulkbillies, managed to inspire Hugh Jackman&amp;rsquo;s final Wolverine movie, Logan - a film with all the heart and thoughtfulness that the original series lacked.</description>

The word that set most of the Reading Through It Book Club on edge last night was &amp;ldquo;transgressive.&amp;rdquo; That word shows up a lot in Angela Nagle&amp;rsquo;s book Kill All Normies: Online Culture Wars from 4Chan and Tumblr to Trump and the Alt-Right. She quotes Milo Yiannopolous and other alt-right figures who call themselves &amp;ldquo;transgressive,&amp;rdquo; and she seems to buy into the word a fair amount.
But are the men who call themselves men&amp;rsquo;s rights activists and gamergaters and white separatists online really &amp;ldquo;transgressive?</description>

      <description>Yes, the world is terrible, but every now and then you deserve a good thing. Follow this thread. I swear it&amp;rsquo;s worth it.
So there was a MYSTERY at the library today.
A wee old women came in and said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve a question. Why does page 7 in all the books I take out have the 7 underlined in pen? It seems odd.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; I say, thinking she might be a bit off her rocker.</description>

      <description>When I was a college student in San Diego, I worked part-time at the Natural History Museum doing a variety of jobs. I was a zoology major and was once invited to join the herpetologist and his student assistants in the field. We drove over the mountains and dropped into the desert near the border. I was the only brown person in the car, and when a border patrol helicopter whirred overhead, one of the assistants yelled, with mock urgency, âHide Donna!</description>

      <description>Tomorrow night at Core Gallery from 6 to 9 pm, Expedition Press founder Myrna Keliher will debut On Edge, a month-long show of her series of Broken Broadsides prints.
Over the phone, Keliher explains the project: you take the concept of a broadside (which she describes as &amp;ldquo;a poster of a poem&amp;rdquo;) and focus it, centering the work on &amp;ldquo;a few lines broken out and then reframed in a different context.</description>

      <description>April is National Poetry Month. While for many readers and lovers of poetry this means a bit more time than normal looking through the pages of your favorite chapbook, and lingering in the well-stocked poetry sections of Seattle&amp;rsquo;s many indie bookstores (the best-stocked, of course, being the store that is made up entirely of poetry), if you&amp;rsquo;re a poet (or would like to become a poet), April offers you a compelling challenge: it&amp;rsquo;s also National Poetry Writing Month.</description>

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;from its trunk.
A car stereo begins playing

      <description>Rebecca Brown, the smartest writer in Seattle, has been out of commission recovering from a broken ankle. But with spring poking its fuzzy little head out of the newly muddy earth, Brown seems eager to get off the couch and out into the world with at least two events this month. This Thursday at Gallery 1412, Brown will be reading new and old work to celebrate her long winter&amp;rsquo;s hibernation and her new spring awakening.</description>

Ten Times Gravity Reading this essay by Richard Chiem is like being run over by a very gentle freight train; there&amp;#8217;s a vibration on the tracks, then suddenly you&amp;#8217;re aflight â slightly stunned, wondering how something that looked far off got so close so fast.</description>

March&#39;s Theme: Sarahs Life has presented me with many Sarahs; I believe I am not unique in this experience. But Iâve only ever had two main Sarahs &amp;mdash; that rare and special Sarah who stays untethered to any modifier (specifying last name, perhaps, or that I mean so-and-soâs Sarah).</description>

Dear Cienna,
**Thereâs this couple Iâve been friends with for years. One of them is writing a memoir, which I agreed to edit.**
When I got the manuscript, I realized it documents a bunch of stuff I wish I didnât know â without getting too specific, there are stories in this thing that call their entire relationship into question.</description>

      <description>Samantha Cole writes at Motherboard:
In the last few days, word has spread among independent erotica authors on social media that Amazon was quietly changing its policies for erotic novels. Five authors I spoke to, and several more on social media, have reported that their books were stripped of their best seller rankingsâessentially hiding them from casual browsing on the site, and separating them from more mainstream, safe-for-work titles. Coincidentally, serial-fiction app Radish has also just eliminated all erotica from its digital shelves.</description>

      <title>Thursday Comics Hangover: You belong to The City</title>

      <description>Why are fictional cities such a common trope in comics? More than any other art form, comics seem to make it easy to create locations with their own unique spirit. Compare Metropolis in the Superman comics with the Metropolis of any of the Superman movies, for instance, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see how hard it is for film to duplicate the world-building of the comic books. In just a few panels, artists can give Metropolis its own flavor: an art deco city of the future, with flags and golden sunlight everywhere.</description>

      <description>Hugo House is very close to moving in to their new home in the old location â the sign is up! â but they still need to raise a little cash before they can settle in. Right now, they&amp;rsquo;ve announced that they&amp;rsquo;ve got a Challenge Match of $100,000. &amp;ldquo;That means every dollar donated will be doubled,&amp;rdquo; an email from the House announced.

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re on a book review website, so the chances are good that you&amp;rsquo;re occasionally just completely gobsmacked by the beauty of a word. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve been astounded by the fact that a word like &amp;ldquo;chair&amp;rdquo; fits so perfectly with the idea of what a chair is and does. Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve been suddenly taken with the idea of the word &amp;ldquo;enormous&amp;rdquo; - eee-NOR-mous! - to the extent that you force the word into strange new contexts.</description>

      <description>Visit any bookstore and you&amp;rsquo;ll see that a whole spectrum of once-viable books are no longer considered desirable. It&amp;rsquo;s virtually impossible, for instance, to give away a set of old encyclopedias. The &amp;ldquo;â¦for Dummies&amp;rdquo; series of books about outdated computer programs are literally not worth the paper and ink they&amp;rsquo;re printed on. And very few people have any interest in antique buying guides.
Another book that seems to be falling out of favor is the humble joke book.</description>

      <description>Every year the University of Washington Libraries host Literary Voices, a dinner to support the Libraries and this year, to provide scholarships for its student staff â a lovely idea and one from which we all benefit. Each year the keynote address is stunning; this year, the featured guest is Ted Chiang. Chiang&amp;rsquo;s writing brought a kind of imagination back to hard science fiction that a lot of readers had stopped expecting, and he&amp;rsquo;s applied the same lens, terrifyingly, to the giants of tech.</description>

      <description>Charles Johnson is one of Seattle&amp;rsquo;s literary giants - right up there with authors like Jonathan Raban and Richard Hugo and Denise Levertov. One of Seattle&amp;rsquo;s few National Book Award winners and a MacArthur &amp;ldquo;Genius,&amp;rdquo; Johnson has represented the city at a time when the nation still considered us to be a literary lightweight.
Johnson&amp;rsquo;s fiction has often been celebrated for the way he has corrected the historical record. His historical novels and short stories have helped provide a voice for Black Americans who have been cut out of the history books.</description>

**BM: What is the greatest misconception about book critics and criticism?**
PC: That negative reviews are a bad thing. Itâs important for a critic to write and publish negative reviews so that their readers can get a complete sense of what their tastes are.</description>

Our March Poet in Residence, Julene Tripp Weaver, is right now having a moment. This month, she&#39;s reading multiple times all over the region and her most recent poetry collection, *Truth be bold â Serenading life &amp; death in the age of AIDS* was nominated for a Lambda Award. She&#39;s squeezing more activity into the month of March than most poets in Seattle manage to do in a year. But Weaver isn&#39;t an overnight success; she&#39;s been quietly putting out and reading quality work in Seattle for a couple of decades, and she&#39;ll keep writing and reading even when the spotlight moves to another poet for a while.</description>

Here&amp;#39;s a little story I&amp;#39;ve told often in private but never in public. Several years ago I was the emcee of a high profile author event.
&amp;mdash; Shannon Hale (@haleshannon) March 19, 2018 For the love of God, authors: everyone has a megaphone now. If you can&amp;rsquo;t act like a decent human being because it&amp;rsquo;s the right thing to do, you should at least act like a decent human being because the world will very likely learn about your behavior.</description>

      <description>The natural state of humanity is to acknowledge tragedy, to honor it, and then to move on. We forget the dead, we can&amp;rsquo;t remember what pain felt like in the exact moment that we realized something horrible had happened. This is a survival mechanism; if we never physically stopped feeling the immediate hurt of heartbreak and loss, we would not live for very long. The pain has to fade; the memory has to dissolve.</description>

      <description>The antique cards from my great grandmother,
the photographs of ancestors I did not know,
so much regal furniture, I sat in a closed off
parlor, quiet in a King George chair, looked
across the room at the matching couch,
the grand organ, the gold trimmed tall mirror
with marble at its base, hung full length
between tall windows formally draped.
I loved the quiet in this room, the history I</description>

      <title>Get a peek at Janet Buttenwieser&#39;s new memoir</title>

      <description>Published barely a month ago, local writer Janet Buttenwieser&amp;rsquo;s memoir GUTS is perfectly in season. The story of her double loss âÂ a significant hit to her health, the devastating loss of a friend âÂ GUTS is about persistence, resilience, and renewal, a few things we all need right now. It&amp;rsquo;s also about that most Seattle-y sport possible, the triathlon, and using physical endurance to endure emotional challenges. And it&amp;rsquo;s a delight to read: clear, funny, self-reflective.</description>

      <description>We look to novelists to inspire us, but we also look to them to tweak the ugliest parts of our imaginations, to invent the unimaginable, to speak the unsayable. It&amp;rsquo;s not that humans are inherently bad, exactly. We&amp;rsquo;re just inherently fascinated by bad behavior. That&amp;rsquo;s why the Devil - with a little more than a glorified cameo - became the sleeper favorite character of the Bible. We like to think about terrible things, and then we like to put the book down and resume our ordinary lives.</description>

      <description>Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles we enjoyed this week, good for consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if thatâs your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also look through the archives.
Does recovery kill great writing? Move past the Bettridge-y headline and dig straight into this essay by Leslie Jamison on the relationship between booze and books âÂ or, more accurately but less pithily, on giving up booze while continuing to write books.</description>

      <description>First, let&amp;rsquo;s begin with a correction. In this week&amp;rsquo;s Event of the Week column, I credited the Dock Street Salon solely to Dock Street Press publisher Dane Bahr. In fact, Bahr co-hosts the salon with Seattle author and publisher Heather Jacobs. And this week&amp;rsquo;s edition of the Salon was entirely curated and coordinated by Jacobs, not Bahr. I sincerely apologize to Jacobs for getting that wrong, and I&amp;rsquo;ve amended the listing to give her proper credit.</description>

      <description>I came late to cartoonist Rich Tommaso&amp;rsquo;s work - the first comic of his that I read was the funny-animal Tintin pastiche Spy Seal - but I think I&amp;rsquo;m falling in love. His art is so clean, his storytelling so economical, that it seems like it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of time before one of the mainstream publishers shows up on his front lawn with a dump truck of money and forces him to start drawing Batman for a living.</description>

      <description>At Yes Magazine, Jacqueline Keeler has written an excellent story that offers some background and some wider context into the allegations surrounding Sherman Alexie. The piece is titled &amp;ldquo;Why Reading Sherman Alexie Was Never Enough: As the #MeToo spotlight moves to Indian Country, epidemic violence against Native women meets tokenism in publishing,&amp;rdquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely worth your time.
 If, like me, you had never heard of Seattle-area sci-fi writer E Lily Yu before she was named the winner of this year&amp;rsquo;s Gar LaSalle Storyteller Award, you might want to read her latest story at Clarkesworld magazine.</description>

      <description>In the winter of 1897, a New York City plumber taking a break from a job on Fifth Avenue did something that went viral (or at least the late nineteenth century equivalent). He walked into the Metropolitan Museum of Art to check out the exhibitions and was promptly asked to leave. The reason? His dirty overalls were deemed offensive to the sensibilities of this refined cultural space.
Initially reported in the New York Times, the incident made headlines across the country, sparking vigorous debate about the relationship between the museum and the working classes.</description>

      <description>Alan LaMont, the owner of Ballard&amp;rsquo;s The Grumpy Old Man&amp;rsquo;s Comics, Art, and Collectibles doesn&amp;rsquo;t come across as a grumpy old man. He&amp;rsquo;s downright chipper, in fact, and he&amp;rsquo;s got the youthful vigor and charm of someone who&amp;rsquo;s finally living a life he&amp;rsquo;s been dreaming about for decades.
After years &amp;ldquo;working in corporate America&amp;rdquo; in Rochester New York and dreaming of the Pacific Northwest, LaMont finally moved to Seattle on Labor Day of 2017.</description>

      <description>Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan&amp;rsquo;s World War II film, is a brilliant technical achievement. Made using mostly practical special effects, and told through an ambitious three-tier story that collapses three different timelines into a single climactic battle, the movie was one of the most remarkable cinematic achievements of 2017.
I watched Dunkirk at the Cinerama on opening weekend, and I appreciated both the film&amp;rsquo;s technical mastery and the pure emotion behind it. But I&amp;rsquo;m embarrassed to admit that for much of the film&amp;rsquo;s runtime, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell what the hell was going on.</description>

      <description>- after Gregory Pardlo
It was leap year, on a Thursday, I was born
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;upstate New York, Borsch Belt small town.
To a family of farmers, where covered bridges crossed
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;creeks. Twenty miles to the racetrack in
Monticello, our nearest city, where father worked
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for an air conditioning installation firm.

Born to arrowheads and quartz, to blueberry

Try a chapter from sponsor Joe Ponepinto&amp;rsquo;s Mr. Neutron âÂ a political, science-fictional satire starring a down-and-out political flunky and a cadaverous (in the best way) mayoral candidate in small-town Grand River.
Ponepinto is known to many of you as the founding publisher and fiction editor of the Tahoma Literary Review. We&amp;rsquo;re honored to have him as a sponsor and delighted to suggest his lastest to you.</description>

The Salon, which is named after Seattle publisher Dock Street Books, is an informal reading and Q&amp;amp;A session with local authors cohosted by Seattle author and publisher Heather Jacobs and the ever-charming and enthusiastic publisher of Dock Street, Dane Bahr.</description>

From Afrin to Ghouta Hungarian philosopher G. M. TamÃ¡s writes passionately, furiously, and without sentiment (will make sense when you read it) of the world&amp;#8217;s inexcusable behavior toward refugees: not only our failure to offer assistance to those who flee violence and brutuality, but our cowardly eagerness to make demons of those who have been injured â for fear of becoming powerless ourselves.</description>

      <description>When I was a kid, I loved poring over the old cosmic superhero comics of the 1970s. Something about those books â their shaggy-haired heroes pondering the self and free will, against a trippy backdrop of stars and cosmic energy âÂ appealed to my sense of self-indulgence.
One of my favorites from that time was Jim Starlin&amp;rsquo;s Adam Warlock series, a blessedly self-contained adventure of a space messiah who ultimately had to confront his twisted mature self.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already written at length about Amy Goldstein&amp;rsquo;s amazing book Janesville. It was one of my favorite books of last year, a beautifully reported study of the economic turmoil that rocks Paul Ryan&amp;rsquo;s hometown after the GM plant closes. If you want to understand the human cost of the perils facing rural America right now, there&amp;rsquo;s no better book to read âÂ toss aside your Hillbilly Elegy and your New York Times profiles of sympathetic Trump supporters, because you won&amp;rsquo;t need them anymore.</description>

      <description>For years, Seattle author Neal Stephenson has argued that science fiction, in its long lean to the dystopian, has abdicated its responsibility to imagine positive solutions to humanity&amp;rsquo;s worst problems.
Back in 2014, Stephenson joined a community of writers in an anthology of optimistic stories titled Hieroglyph: Stories &amp;amp; Visions for a Better Future. I read Hieroglyph when it was published, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you now what any of the stories were about.</description>

      <description>Last week, Greenwood bookstore Couth Buzzard launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise $9,500 in order to keep the store going. Owner Theo Dzielak announced that the store needed the money to address &amp;ldquo;sharp increases in rent, license fees and taxes, supporting our employees with fair wages, the effects of new health and environmental regulations, the ongoing need to repair and replace aging equipment, and many other costs.&amp;rdquo;
The store is now more than halfway to the goal.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What we were heading toward,&amp;rdquo; Seattle writer Natalie Singer writes at the beginning of her new memoirâ¦
â¦was bigger than a natural, perfect family. In that plane, over the next six hours, I would cross over into what I hoped would be my own version of freedom. By the time the plane touched down at the San Jose International Airport, I would be unburdened of the pressures of my old high school, the weight of family secrets that burned like a brand, and the loneliness of my existence in the nowhere of the North.</description>

      <description>I believe the women who talked to NPR about being sexually harassed by Sherman Alexie. I admire the bravery that it must have taken to speak up against such a powerful man in the literary community. I hope that sharing their stories helps them find some emotional peace, and if there are others out there who have had the same experience as these women â as we&amp;rsquo;ve learned in the last six months, there are often more women â I hope that they find inspiration in the courage that these women displayed.</description>

      <description>We may have been young and stupid
We tried things this life
We survived to tell or hold our tongue
I only wanted good teeth
It was the kind of day that kissed
my adrenals, I was in love but didnât
know, I forget his essential nature
Looking at altars I swim the undersea
Our art, how we breathe it
becomes our moment of forgiveness
Everything essential dies or disappears</description>

      <description>Lynn Neary at NPR published a report this afternoon accusing Seattle author Sherman Alexie of sexually harassing female authors. This report is especially noteworthy because it&amp;rsquo;s the first in recent days to actually include the named testimonies of three women.
In the report, Seattle author Jeanine Walker, Erika Wurth, and former Seattle author Elissa Washuta each recalled personal experiences with Alexie. The particulars vary from story to story, but taken in aggregate they paint a portrait of Alexie as someone who abuses his high standing in the literary community to make aggressive sexual advances on emerging women writers.</description>

      <description>This week, the Seattle Review of Books is sponsored by Lois Farfel Stark â the award-winning filmmaker behind more than forty documentaries and, now, the author of The Telling Image. Stark&amp;rsquo;s new book is an exploration of how humans experience the world through shape: a web, a ladder, a helix. Her vast experience makes a tour de force out of what could easily have been a quiet coffee table book.</description>

      <description>**Monday, March 5: *California Calling* Reading**
Natalie Singer was from Canada. She dreamed of living in California - wrote a whole book about it, in fact, titled *California Calling* - and now she&#39;s living in Seattle. Tonight, she debuts her lyric memoir with another Seattle author, Sonora Jha. This book is getting a lot of pre-publication praise and it&#39;s from great Oregon publisher Hawthorne Books and this reading is free, so you have no excuse to skip this one.</description>

      <description>Ijeoma Oluo didn&amp;rsquo;t ask to be Seattle&amp;rsquo;s conscience. But often the most responsible, honest person in any given area is granted a role of community conscience - especially if they&amp;rsquo;d never asked for that role in the first place.
At times, it seems as though Oluo is biologically incapable of writing a dishonest word. She speaks the truth, clearly and repeatedly. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t suffer fools. She speaks against injustice as often as she needs to, and the world is a very unjust place.</description>

How to write a memoir while grieving When Nicole Chung&amp;#8217;s father died, she was still writing the story of her family and her adoption â the memoir was due to her editor just one day after she found out he was dead.</description>

Dear Cienna,
**My willpower seems to be diminished to the point of nothingness. I canât stay off my phone long enough to read a damn book.

This Sunday, Seattle Arts and Lectures is bringing Pulitzer Prize winning poet Jess to McCaw Hall. Jess is an artist who seems custom built for this moment in history. His poetry reflects the rich history of music of Black America - the blues, the gospel, the work songs, the jazz - and heâs rewriting the nationâs history to make more space for Black stories and songs.</description>

      <description>Every month, Olivia Waite pulls back the covers, revealing the very best in new, and classic, romance. We&#39;re extending a hand to you. Won&#39;t you take it? And if you&#39;re still not sated, there&#39;s always [the archives](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/kissing-books).
Romanceâs greatest strength can also be its greatest weakness.
Romanceâs purpose is to map in detail the intimate geography of the human heart. The genre invites us to peer deeply into a hero and/or heroineâs secret world &amp;mdash; even when the characters are familiar types (the spunky ingenue, the troubled aristocrat) every romance heavily prioritizes the interiority of its protagonists, in all their messy, muddled glory.</description>

Additionally, funders who provide up to $100 in support will receive an equal amount in store credit to spend on books at the shop.

      <description>Emerald City Comicon has long since sold out, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t enjoy a number of (free) comics-centered celebrations around Seattle this weekend. Here are a few of the best-looking events for you to attend:
 Broadway&amp;rsquo;s Phoenix Comics is hosting a signing tonight from 5 to 7 pm with Seattle author G. Willow Wilson and former Batgirl writer and MotorCrush writer/artist Babs Tarr.
 The fantastic free comics anthology Thick as Thieves is hosting &amp;ldquo;Thievescon&amp;rdquo; Friday night at Nii Modo on Stone Way.</description>

      <description>Tonight, Nina Shapiro and Brendan Kiley at the Seattle Times published the most comprehensive coverage of the accusations swirling around Seattle author Sherman Alexie to date, including a statement from Alexie.
Over the last few weeks, a number of literary figures have leveled unsettling charges against Seattle author Sherman Alexie on social media. Seattle author Litsa Dremousis has tweeted that &amp;ldquo;Dozens of women&amp;rdquo; have approached her with stories of Alexie &amp;ldquo;sexually harassing them, making unwanted advances, cornering them in rooms, &amp;amp;/or explicitly threatening to end their literary careers if they told anyone.</description>

      <description>Emerald City Comicon is coming this weekend! The fantastic Sarah Anne Lloyd at Curbed compiled a handy list of Seattle-area comics shops to visit over the weekend. I have to admit, I had never heard of Burien&amp;rsquo;s Ancient Comics until I read this list and now I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to check it out.
 The Seattle Public Library&amp;rsquo;s Shelf Talk Blog is celebrating ECCC with a list of worldbuilding comics, including Faith Erin Hicks&amp;rsquo;s excellent Nameless City series.</description>

      <description>Thereâs an iconic photograph of the Philippine People Power Revolution of February 1986 that ousted Ferdinand Marcos: several men perch atop light poles, while beneath them a sea of people swells on Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA), a Coca-Cola sign â that symbol of American enterprise â in the distance. Over three days, more than two million citizens mobilized in spontaneous opposition to the US-supported dictator. Declining the advice of one of his generals to fire upon the people, Marcos fled the country.</description>

Love and Rockets co-creator Jaime Hernandez is a guest at Emerald City Comic Con this weekend, but he can&amp;rsquo;t visit Seattle without a visit to his lifelong publisher, Fantagraphics Books. This Saturday at 7 pm, Hernandez will be signing books and talking with fans at a free event in the Fantagraphics Bookstore and Gallery in Georgetown to celebrate the release of a deluxe artist edition portfolio highlighting his creative process as a cartoonist.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s open with a word of praise, first, for the Seattle Public Library&amp;rsquo;s Peak Picks program, which places copies of popular titles in neighborhood library branches on a first-come, first-serve basis. It&amp;rsquo;s the perfect antidote to those long lists of holds that vex library users who want to read the hottest, newest titles on their release. The program encourages readers to visit their local library often, and it encourages high circulation numbers, and it gets hot new books into more hands.</description>

      <description>For the first month of the year, those interested in childrenâs literature speculate frantically about which books will win the American Library Associationâs book awards. And when the winners are announced, sales go up. Before Kelly Barnhillâs The Girl Who Drank the Moon received the 2017 Newbery Medal, its sales were 17,484. After it won, the number shot up to 56,653 âÂ a 324% shift. The same goes for the year-end lists produced by organizations and book lovers to promote the âbestâ childrenâs or young adult books published that year.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve heard Artie Kane, even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of him. Kane spent decades in Hollywood, composing, conducting, and playing the music to a dizzying number of television shows (Wonder Woman!) and movies (Eyes of Laura Mars!) âÂ and along the way, hobnobbing with the giants of the entertainment industry.
Amphora Editions, a small publisher with a penchant for the odd and beautiful, is sponsoring us this week to give you an inside look at Kane&amp;rsquo;s new memoir, Music to My Years: a candid and wryly witty account of his life and adventures in entertainment.</description>

      <description>**Monday, February 26: Family Story Time**
I donât know what could possibly be cuter than families wearing pajamas and bringing their favorite stuffed animals to a storytime in the Queen Anne Library. Maybe if they had pet bunnies at the event, too. But that might be overkill, right? *Seattle Public Library, Queen Anne Branch, 400 W Garfield St, http://spl.org, 6:30 pm, free.* **Tuesday, February 27: *Winter Sisters* Launch Party**
Bestselling Seattle author Robin Oliveira debuts her new novel, *Winter Sisters* with a book talk, reading, Q&amp;A, prize drawing and maybe some wine.</description>

      <title>Literary Event of the Week: Tyehimba Jess at McCaw Hall</title>

      <description>Last year, when his collection Olio won the Pulitzer Prize, Tyehimba Jess became one of the best-known living poets in America. Jess has been celebrated in poetry circles for years, of course - leadbelly, a previous collection, won awards in 2004 - but Olio, published by Seattle publisher Wave Books, became an instantaneous must-have collection. Ironically, the fact that Wave was overwhelmed by the demand for Olio might have helped the book&amp;rsquo;s success: it made Olio a must-have book, an object of desire that lasted much longer than the Pulitzer&amp;rsquo;s glow might have lasted.</description>

      <description>Over on our Instagram page, weâre posting a weekly installation from Clare Johnsonâs Post-it Note Project, a long running daily project. Hereâs her wrap-up and statement from February&#39;s posts.
February&#39;s theme: Song Lyrics I have no problem with the weather or the dark this time of year &amp;mdash; Seattle&amp;rsquo;s coldest cold is nothing compared to other places, plants start changing early, and in February I always feel the air softening in this strange way.</description>

      <description>Every month, Daneet Steffens uncovers the latest goings on in mystery, suspense, and crime fiction. See previous columns on the [Criminal Fiction archive page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/criminal-fiction)
Including both James Lee Burke and Alafair Burke in this column got me thinking of other mystery-writing family ties. Whether itâs a collaborative, mother-offspring effort a la [Mary Higgins Clark-Carol Higgins Clark](http://www.cnn.com/books/dialogue/9805/higgins.clark/) , [PJ Tracy](https://mysterypeople.wordpress.com/2017/08/15/mysterypeople-qa-with-traci-lambrecht-of-pj-tracy/) ([see also this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7UjXFUpg4U)), and [Charles Todd](https://www.charlestodd.com/author/) or an [all-in-the-family business](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/magazine/stephen-kings-family-business.html?pagewanted=all), itâs dead good fun to imagine those in-the-writing-studio and dinner-table conversations.</description>

      <description>Last month, Drawn and Quarterly published the new English translation of Swedish cartoonist Anneli Furmark&amp;rsquo;s comic Red Winters. Though the book is set in 1970s Sweden, it feels newly relevant for a politically charged America in 2018.
Red Winter is the story of an affair, but it&amp;rsquo;s also a political story. In the dark of winter, a wife and mother named Siv finds comfort in the arms of a young unmarried man named Ulrik.</description>

      <description>Buried in this South Sound Magazine story about new additions to SeaTac International Airport by Kirsten Abel, there&amp;rsquo;s a piece of news that Seattle Review of Books readers will be especially interested to hear. A ton of local restaurants are opening in SeaTac over the next few years, but SeaTac will also be home to an outpost of the Elliott Bay Book Company. This move has a local precedent, of course: Portland indie bookstore Powell&amp;rsquo;s has an airport outpost, too.</description>

      <description>A keening moan in the night that is somehow both human and animal. An artist who makes a chrysalis sculpture that becomes the molted husk of her own transformation. A merciless city-state grafting living animal and machine parts to its prisoners. An historian of a lost culture who infects himself with plant spores in pursuit of the truth. This is the teeming, constantly transforming world of the New Weird. This small, experimental and hybrid genre planted its flag at the intersection between fantasy, horror, sci-fi, and supernatural two decades ago and continues to cultivate that fertile territory today.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I started writing poetry in eighth grade,&amp;rdquo; our February Poet in Residence, Azura Tyabji, tells me over the phone. She&amp;rsquo;d always considered herself a writer - she wrote and assembled her own books as a child, and she participated in the school paper as soon as she could - but &amp;ldquo;I never really considered myself a poet.&amp;rdquo; It was an assignment to read a poem in a student showcase that inspired her.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in creative uses of the comics format, or in innovative literary fiction, this week&amp;rsquo;s sponsor sample is a must-see. Kevin Marshall&amp;rsquo;s Not Really an Emotion walks the border between reality and dream, transforming the familiar comic book conventions (panels, speech bubbles) into something strange and new. The storyline of Not Really an Emotion is appropriately dreamlike: a young woman, meditating, hears music she can&amp;rsquo;t forget, and seeks to recreate it through means both natural and fantastic.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve said for years that I don&amp;rsquo;t believe in writer&amp;rsquo;s block. I believe writing to be a craft more than an art, and I think the only way to cure a problem with writing is to sit down and work through it by writing - a lot. Inspiration is cheap, and words are entirely free. Too many people use writer&amp;rsquo;s block as a convenient excuse to explain away their fears, or to undercut their own ambition.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a story you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard: in a strange world of dragons and heroes, a bratty young heir to a great fortune is about to enter an arranged marriage with a young woman he&amp;rsquo;s never met. Published in January, Chandler Klang Smith&amp;rsquo;s second novel The Sky Is Yours takes that simple hero narrative and plasters it over withâ¦well, everything.
The Sky Is Yours is what I&amp;rsquo;ve come to describe as an &amp;lsquo;everything novel,&amp;rsquo; by which I mean it&amp;rsquo;s one of those huge, overstuffed tomes that seems to contain every stray thought the author&amp;rsquo;s mind entertained over the course of the writing of the book.</description>

Earthâs crust eager to rift itself into a beast that breathes fire.

      <description>**Monday, February 19: Densho Day Remembrance**
Noted patriot and memoirist Khizr Khan leads a day of remembrance for all the Japanese-Americans who fought and protested and were held in camps during World War II. There will also be a documentary screening and live music. *Seattle Center Fisher Pavillion, 305 Harrison St, 2 pm, free.* **Tuesday, February 20: * The Silence of Vanishing Things* Reading**
Is âan over-reliance on scientific terminology and conceptsâ¦quietly undermining the human ability to come to grips with the climate crisis?</description>

      <description>British Columbia author Ruth Ozeki&amp;rsquo;s majestic 2013 novel A Tale for the Time Being imagined a global perspective on the Northwest, pinning together the Fukushima meltdown with our coastline on the other side of the world. She is a vocal supporter of the amazing Hedgebrook writers residency for women. And she&amp;rsquo;s a natural teacher who has guided new generations to the pleasures and challenges of writing fiction.
Ozeki is also a Zen Buddhist priest-ordained in 2010-and that informs her work more than any single region or theme ever could.</description>

      <description>Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles we enjoyed this week, good for consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that&#39;s your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also look through the archives.
The Great Stink Laurie Penny somehow manages to be deeply compassionate toward men who treat women badly, without surrending a single ounce of her righteous, blazing fury.</description>

      <description>Every week we ask an interesting figure what they&#39;re digging into. Have ideas who we should reach out to? Let it fly: [info@seattlereviewofbooks.com](mailto:info@seattlereviewofbooks.com). Want to read more? Check out the [archives](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/whatcha-reading).
 Alix Christie is a writer and journalist based in London. Her novel Gutenberg&amp;rsquo;s Apprentice (which I absolutely adored) came out in 2014. She&amp;rsquo;s at work on a new novel about her Scots ancestors in the Pacific Northwest.

      <description>Every Friday, Cienna Madrid offers solutions to lifeâs most vexing literary problems. Do you need a book recommendation to send your worst cousin on her birthday? Is it okay to read erotica on public transit? Cienna can help. Send your questions to advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.
Dear Cienna,
**All my friends whoâve done writer residencies swear by them. But they also donât really have any work to show from their time away. As an aspiring writer with very little free time on her hands, should I be wasting writing time on residency applications?</description>

      <description>Earlier this week, this happened:
Jay Asher was quietly expelled from the Society of Childrenâs Book Writers and Illustrators last year after the organization determined that the *Thirteen Reasons Why* author violated its harassment code, [*Entertainment Weekly*] has confirmed. The news only became public on Monday, after Asher received scrutiny in the wake of a School Library Journal article on sexual harassment in childrenâs publishing. Yesterday, this happened:
James Dashner, author of the *Maze Runner* series, has been dropped by his literary agent following sexual-misconduct claims.</description>

      <description>Berger Books, the new editor-driven imprint from Portland publisher Dark Horse Comics, is something new in the world of comics. It&amp;rsquo;s a bet that readers of comics actually care about editors - or even really understand what comics editors do, for that matter. But to be fair, Karen Berger is one of the most successful editors in comics history: she created DC Comics&amp;rsquo;s wildly successful Vertigo line, which created the template for modern mature-readers comics.</description>

      <description>We first told you about this seven months ago, and now it&amp;rsquo;s officially a reality: Tacoma has named a new park after the life and works of sci-fi author Frank Herbert. &amp;ldquo;Dune Peninsula at Point Defiance Park&amp;rdquo; is an 11-acre park featuring &amp;ldquo;Frank Herbert Trail.&amp;rdquo; Tacoma Metro Parks commissioner Erik Hanberg told the News Tribune that Herbert&amp;rsquo;s âexperiences in Tacoma shaped his appreciation for the delicate balance of nature, so it feels right to attach his name to a park that reclaims toxic land.</description>

      <description>In 2008 I opened a Twitter account. I was driving from Seattle to Chicago with two friends for a social media conference; we used Twitter to communicate our location, to meet strangers along the way, to get ideas about where to stop and what to do once weâd stopped there. A friend joined Twitter while I was on the road. Heâd been following my 140-character-count updates for much of the journey, but he really wanted to tweet back: It was essential I not miss a particular roadside attraction.</description>

      <description>A little over a week ago, I moderated a panel on DIY culture for Literary Career Day at the Seattle Public Library downtown. The panel conversation was between myself, author Jeffrey Cheatham of the Seattle Urban Book Expo, and poet Rita Wirkala of Seattle Escribe, but many of the dozens of young aspiring authors in the room took part in the conversation, which covered a wide array of topics.
Cheatham talked about his surprising success with the first Urban Book Expo, and his current attempts to turn the festival into &amp;ldquo;an actual movement, a culture&amp;rdquo; that represents writers and readers of color in Seattle.</description>

      <description>Outdoorsiness is having a moment. All of a sudden, popular culture is obsessed with people (particularly young people) fending for themselves in the wild. In comics like Lumberjanes, in fiction for young readers like Arlo Finch in the Valley of Fire, in novels like My Absolute Darling, in films like The Mountain Between Us, characters are using quick wits and thoughtful preparation to survive in the woods without any of the technological advances we take for granted.</description>

_there is a crack in everything_

      <description>Many, many thanks to Pope Brock for his two-week sponsorship of the site! This week brings the second delightful taste of Charlatan: Americaâs Most Dangerous Huckster, the Man Who Pursued Him, and the Age of Flimflam. This vivid, hilarious, and fast-paced history of the early twentieth-century quack Dr. John Romulus Brinkley is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year. The timing is right, the themes are on point, and the storytelling will keep you turning pages.</description>

If youâre new here, or if you havenât been paying attention, hereâs the deal: local musicians create all-new music in response to a book. The results obviously vary, depending on the book and the musicians who are participating.</description>

My Own Alternate Universe Kristen Petersonâs piece on working at a convenience store in Las Vegas is a rare example of the âI took a low-paid jobâ essay thatâs thoughtful and respectful â the viewpoint of a resident of the job, not a tourist.</description>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1518073041341/Economics-in-Wonderland-REICH_0hfl-2q.png)
Letâs be clear: former Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich is a cartoonist, but his latest title from Seattle-based comics publisher Fantagraphics Books, Economics in Wonderland, is not a comic book. The illustrations in the book arenât, strictly speaking, comics. Theyâre cartoons. Perhaps this seems like splitting hairs, but itâs an important distinction: comics involve a juxtaposition of words and illustrations, while cartoons are simply funny drawings that accompany the text without enriching the text.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t say I agree with all of Prateek Vasisht&amp;rsquo;s assessments of the future of libraries, but there are some pretty good insights here:
The trend will be to move away from storing information, instead becoming a place for people for people to interact. Interaction can occur across various media such as with collection items (books, toys, games) or physical devices (pianos, electronics) and does not need to be restricted to human interaction.</description>

      <description>How do you enter the conversation among generations of Continental philosophers? Learn the lingo â and bring a bodyguard. In The Seventh Function of Language, Laurent Binet depicts the big names in 1980s literary theory â Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Julia Kristeva, Bernard-Henri LÃ©vy â as hedonistic, ego-driven monsters who would not hesitate to kill or maim to demonstrate their intellectual superiority. Binetâs novel weaponizes literary theory, a central conceit that brings to mind the Monty Python skit âThe funniest joke in the world.</description>

      <description>When our January Poet in Residence, Kevin Craft, left his post as editor of Poetry Northwest magazine in 2016 for an executive editor position, he tells me, âthe first order of business was to take some time for myself and rediscover myself as a writer.â
Poetry Northwest has a long history of very fine direction from poets including Carolyn Kizer, Richard Hugo, and David Wagoner. Craft took his charge as editor seriously, guiding Poetry Northwest from some creative and financial doldrums back to its rightful place as the standard-bearer of the regionâs literary traditions.</description>

      <description>Seattle author Ross McMeekin is probably best known as the founder and editor of Spartan, the minimalist literary journal. Spartan has, over the course of a few years, become one of the more influential literary forces in the Seattle area; itâs rare to find a group reading in the city, for example, that does not include a Spartan author on the bill.
So when McMeekin announced that his debut novel would be published by Skyhorse in February of 2018, most local folks assumed that The Hummingbirds would be something, well, Spartan â that is to say: minimalist, and literary, and stripped-down, and interested in furthering the Seattle aesthetic McMeekin has promoted over the course of his career.</description>

      <description>Our January Poet in Residence, Kevin Craft, is a writer who has a deep understanding of Seattle&amp;rsquo;s literary tradition and has taken on an active role as a caretaker of that tradition. (You&amp;rsquo;ll hear more from Craft in an interview on that exact subject tomorrow.) Our February Poet in Residence, Azura Tyabji, is one of the newest and most exciting poets in our Seattle tradition.
As Marcie Sillman wrote in the summer of last year, Tyabji, a Seattle native and a student at Nova High School, burst onto the scene thanks to some nurturing poetry teachers and the great local organization Youth Speaks Seattle.</description>

      <description>**Monday, February 5: Thrilling Tales**
The downtown Seattle Public Library hosts a lunch-period storytime for adults two times a month. Itâs a chance for grownups to leave the office, relax and hand over their attention to someone else for a while. Todaysâ short story selection was written by San Diego sci-fi author Greg Bear. Itâs titled &amp;ldquo;Blood Music,â and itâs one of his beset-known works. Seattle Public Library, 1000 4th Ave.</description>

Marie Hausauer is one of Seattleâs mightiest cartoonists. Check out any of her strips and youâll immediately recognize her confident lines and bold color choices. She can be funny or serious or flip back and forth between the two in a single eight-panel strip.
And Hausauer is transcending the gag strip in exciting ways. Her 2016 comic Raccoon focused on the dead and rotting body of a raccoon in the Northwest wilderness with a literary sensibility that evokes minimalists like Raymond Carver.</description>

      <description>Paul Tumey at the Comics Journal wrote a lovely, detailed remembrance of Seattle cartoonist Mark Campos, who passed away in January. Campos was an incredibly supportive cartoonist, reader, and friend. I can&amp;rsquo;t quite bring myself to accept that I won&amp;rsquo;t bump into him at the next Short Run. He was devoted to cartooning, and to Seattle, and to all his many friends. I&amp;rsquo;ll miss Mark very much, and Tumey&amp;rsquo;s piece is a good and fitting tribute to his life.</description>

My favorite alpha heroes in romance are the fragile ones.
They donât seem fragile, at first. Consider Alec Kincaid from the RITA-award winning classic romance The Bride. Heâs a big, burly Scotsman, the much-feared laird of his clan, who kills enemies easily and without a second thought.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying the Young Animal line of comics curated by My Chemical Romance frontman Gerard Way. They&amp;rsquo;re a pop-up imprint published on the fringes of the DC Comics superhero properties, taking on the same rebellious-goth-teen role that Vertigo Comics did back in the 1990s. The best Young Animal books, like Mother Panic, fill in a gap left by the all-ages edict of mainstays like Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman.</description>

      <description>There is a specific beauty to the movements of a mind that has consciously taught itself to reroute around its own weaknesses, that has learned to take unexpected backroads through the landscapes it feels least equipped to understand. About half a decade ago, Ben Blum and I crossed paths in Seattle, and I recognized in him a very particular sort of kinship. We were both presenting for Washington Ensemble Theaterâs Sixpack Series, a wildly irreverent literary reading that gives genre-spanning creatives a theme (in this case, âtoo bored for the lordâ), a month to prep, and twenty completely open minutes on stage.</description>

Is Amazon very good or very bad at naming things? It&amp;rsquo;s honestly hard to tell. Why would any company choose to promote a line of e-reading devices with fire-themed names, for instance? Most businesses would balk at the idea of even hinting at book-burning in their book-related products, but Amazon led with the Kindle and then doubled-down on the concept with its Fire family of tablets. Naming their personal-assistant line of speakers the Echo, too, seems a little cute â what is an echo but a hollow and fading repetition of ourselves?</description>

Last year, digital reading platform Overdrive announced that [King County led the nation in digital book checkouts](https://kcls.org/news/kcls-tops-overdrive-digital-checkouts-in-2017/), ahead of the systems for Los Angeles, New York, and even Seattle.</description>

      <description>Juarez, Mexico is frequently referred to as the most dangerous place in the world. A secondâs worth of Googling will uncover terms like âMurder Valleyâ and news stories titled âWho Is Killing the Women of Juarez?â It is a city that is universally known for violence and death, and that reputation serves many purposes. The drug cartels that keep the city in a grip of fear have redefined the city of Juarez, transformed the worldâs perception of the city into a war zone, a place where innocent victims die with startling regularity.</description>

      <description>I met Ursula Le Guin in Atlanta. I was 31. Ammonite, my first novel, had been accepted for publication as a cheap mass-market paperback and I was trying to figure out how to get it some attention. So I went to Ursula&amp;rsquo;s reading and book signing at a local bookshop and afterwards joined the line that inched closer and closer to her table, clutching one of her books.
Even then I knew that asking a writer on tour to read your book was a bad idea, but also knew that if you don&amp;rsquo;t ask, you don&amp;rsquo;t get.</description>

      <description>Wind kicks a few cups down the alley.
Pocketful of stones, a greasy lot.
Morning chill in fleeting sunlight.
Youâd rather stay under this blanket agreement.
Not any storm can house you off the cuff.
The troposphere brushes your cold turned cheek.
Wake up. Get the child to school.
Now you are alone in this story
of cornflakes and Tuesday frost.
If you smell gas leak, all the more reason.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t picked up the winter/spring 2018 issue of Poetry Northwest, get to it: it&amp;rsquo;s waiting in the magazine stand at your local independent bookstore. Every issue has a theme, and this time around it&amp;rsquo;s visual poetry. Poetry Northwest always has a strong graphic element â the look of the publication gets more interesting with every issue â so we&amp;rsquo;re excited to get our eyes on the pages of this one.</description>

      <description>Monday, January 29: Itâs Even Worse Than You Think Reading
The title of David Cay Johnstonâs latest book, It&amp;rsquo;s Even Worse Than You Think: What the Trump Administration Is Doing to America, about says it all. Johnston has already written one very good book about Trump, so this book is likely follow in that pattern: not many writers out there have genuine insight into Trumpâs actions and management style, but Johnston does.</description>

      <description>Here we are at the end of January and 2018 is already shaping up to be a long year. Everything under the sun is either a disaster or a distraction from a disaster. Weâre learning the horrible truth behind the legends that the media has printed for decades, and weâre realizing that nobody has any goddamn clue whatâs going on.
Itâs important, in the middle of all this chaos and drudgery and nightmare news notifications, to celebrate.</description>

      <title>The King County Council wants more control over 4Culture. Tell them why that&#39;s a bad idea.</title>

      <description>King County Council introduced an ordinanceÂ âÂ Ordinance #2018-0086 âÂ to give the Council more control over 4Culture, the county&amp;rsquo;s cultural funding agency. The ordinance would allow the Council to fire the executive director of the organization, and to name a majority of 4Culture&amp;rsquo;s board of directors. (You can read more about it on 4Culture&amp;rsquo;s own site.)
This all seems rather silly to me. It&amp;rsquo;s not as though 4Culture has done anything wrong â the organization oversees a ton of grants and artist residencies and artist visibility programs, with virtually no controversy and/or scandal along the way.</description>

How I stopped being ashamed of my EBT card In this personal essay about the social stigma (and social anxiety) associated with using food stamps, Janelle Harris deftly de-others people who rely on public assistance to feed themselves and their families.</description>

I enjoyed the first issue of sci-fi writer Saladin Ahmed&amp;rsquo;s Black Bolt series for Marvel Comics, but I ultimately didn&amp;rsquo;t continue with the book, because Black Bolt is the very definition of a one-note character. The best writing in the world couldn&amp;rsquo;t make an aloof mute king with a tuning fork on his forehead a compelling protagonist. But there was so much talent in evidence in that first issue of Black Bolt that when I saw Ahmed had a new creator-owned series coming out from Boom!</description>

      <description>Last summer, I wrote about The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, a sci-fi novel from Portland author Becky Chambers. I gave the book a hard time, chastising it for treading a little too closely to preexisting science fiction tropes. The piece ended, âI breezed through Long Way, but I donât know if Iâm going to be back for the just-released sequel unless Iâm assured that Chambers finally takes her crew somewhere new for a change.</description>

      <title>How we&#39;re remembering Ursula Le Guin</title>

      <description>When the news broke yesterday that Ursula Le Guin passed away, people around the world responded with a genuine outpouring of grief and disbelief. I can&amp;rsquo;t recall the last time I found myself consoling a weeping person when they heard news of an author&amp;rsquo;s death. That happened yesterday, with Le Guin. Her writing â curious, brave, thoughtful â beguiled generations of readers. She shaped an army of feminists. She inspired young women to demand their place at the table.</description>

This week, [*Cascadia Magazine* officially published its first online issue](https://www.cascadiamagazine.org/). The nonprofit publication promises to cover all of the Cascadian bioregion, and they look to publish &#34;quality journalism, personal essays, arts coverage, environmental reporting, fiction, poetry, and photography you wonât find anywhere else.&#34; I talked with the Seattle-based publisher of *Cascadia*, Andrew Engelson, about why he&#39;s starting a magazine in 2018, and what he hopes to do with the publication.</description>

      <description>Ursula Le Guin, grand dame of speculative fiction, and resident of Portland, died yesterday at 88, reports the New York Times.
We&amp;rsquo;ll have more to say about Le Guin soon, who was immensely influential in both her writing, and her steadfast approach to the value of books beyond commercialism.
In her 2014 acceptance of the National Book Foundation&amp;rsquo;s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, she said:
 Books arenât just commodities; the profit motive is often in conflict with the aims of art.</description>

      <description>Seattle cartoonist Sarah Glidden launched a Patreon. For just a buck a month, Glidden will give you access to her diary comics. Glidden notes that her personal comics lately have been about her pregnancy and impending motherhood, and &amp;ldquo;I thought it would be nice to have a little more of an intimate space for posting comics of such a personal nature.&amp;rdquo; Glidden has already produced two books of excellent comics journalism, and these personal strips give her an opportunity to share a different kind of story.</description>

      <description>On Saturday, thousands of womenâs march protesters made downtown Seattle feel as vibrant and alive as it does on any weekday. You could tell who the protesters were by their signs, by their pink knit hats, by the spontaneous chants that joyfully erupted on street corners and in public spaces.
Much of the media failed to acknowledge the hundred thousand protesters who gathered peacefully at Cal Anderson Park and marched down to Seattle Center, but if you were on the street, these protesters were impossible to ignore.</description>

      <description>Oh Wednesday
Full of rain
An argument
With no one
Junk mail
In the mailbox
Hummingbird
In the fall smoke tree
Waiting it out
Coffee going
Cold again
In the untouched
Cup
My father
Not my father
Gone since June
His voice a message
On my phone
Everything
Sounds like rain
In the living room
Of his greeting
When I rewind
Or fast forward
Or gather in stillness
Like smoke</description>

      <description>Applications for 2018 Mineral School residencies (and the six fellowships available to help cover costs) are due on February 15. Writers and visual artists who need a place to start something new or finish something big should leap on this: Mineral School is young, but rapidly gaining an ardent following. The setting is quirky and idyllic, the food is good, and the company is exceptional â just ask Clare Johnson, whose last round-up of Post-It Note art on this site documented her experience at the program.</description>

      <description>**Monday, January 22: * The German Art of Raising Self-Reliant Children* Reading**
Apparently, German parents let their kids do anything up to and including running around cities unsupervised and playing with knives. So why isnât a wave of juvenile delinquency wracking Germany? Apparently, it comes down to *selbstandigkeit*, which translates as âself-reliance.â Parents who are interested will find a lot to think about here. * Westside School, 10404 34th Ave SW, 7 pm, $5.</description>

      <description>A couple weeks ago, Seattle novelist Laurie Frankel talked with me about the difference between a hardcover and a paperback book launch. In hardcover, she said, the readers tend to seek out the book specifically because of reviews or word of mouth. They know what theyâre getting into. But in paperback, she said, the book is priced for discoveryâpeople see the book on a table at a bookstore, for instance, or their book club decides to read it.</description>

      <description>On Friday, Seattle nonprofit writing organization Hugo House learned that the Washington State Legislature had given them a million-dollar Building for the Arts grant. The award ($1.032 million if weâre being precise) moved the House considerably closer to its new home.
âAll our legislators have just been fabulousâ in their support of the organization, Hugo House Executive Director Tree Swenson tells me over the phone. âAll three of our representatives â Nicole Macri, Jamie Pedersen, and Frank Chopp â have all been amazing.</description>

      <description>Last year, small press comics publisher Alterna Comics began publishing a line of cheap comics. Printed on flimsy newsprint, these books sold for $1.50 a pop â about half the price of the cheapest monthly comics published by the big two mainstream publishers.
Unfortunately, most of what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen from Alterna Comics hasn&amp;rsquo;t blown me away. One comic, Amazing Age is clearly playing for a noxious kind of superhero nostalgia. It reads like a Marvel Comic from the 1980s with worse art â full of self-referential superhero action with no depth or consequences.</description>

A couple of years ago, brainy blog The Awl moved all their pieces over to blogging site Medium, presumably in search of a business model that would sustain the site. (You don&amp;rsquo;t change everything about your publishing model unless your publishing model needs serious help.</description>

      <description>Look, I think fan fiction is a great thing. People have been writing fan fiction for as long as there&amp;rsquo;s been stories â you could make a very compelling case for playwrights and poets telling multiple versions of the same stories as an early draft of fan fiction.

      <description>The New Statesman reports that it&amp;rsquo;s getting harder than ever to make a living as a novelist in Great Britain:
In todayâs market, selling 3,000 copies of your novel is not unrespectable â but factor in the average hardback price of Â£10.12 and the retailerâs 50 per cent cut, and just Â£15,000 remains to share between publisher, agent and author. No wonder that the percentage of authors earning a full-time living solely from writing dropped from 40 per cent in 2005 to 11.</description>

Is less than candid
And the office holder
Heavy handed,
While the Senate
Dabbles in senility
And the city feeds
On incivility.
When fact is fiction,
Faction fact,
What tribute
Should the tribe exact?
Few words follow
Veni vidi vici veto.
Forensics
Stuffs its face with Cheetos
Like rodents
Gnawing at a rostrum.
The Social Wars &amp;mdash;
Now thereâs a custom
Any pleb can get behind.
Time again to face the nation.</description>

      <description>The fabulous Grey Sun Press is this week&amp;rsquo;s sponsor, and they&amp;rsquo;re sharing a meaty chapter from the fast-paced fantasy epic Amaskan&amp;rsquo;s Blood by Seattle author Raven Oak. The first book in the Boahim series, Amaskan&amp;rsquo;s Blood introduces a young woman warrior with a bit of a problem: she&amp;rsquo;s miles from home and from her people, tangled in political intrigue, and suddenly unsure that even her name is her own. The e-book is available on Amazon.</description>

      <description>Each week, [Christine Larsen](http://christinelarsen.com) creates a new portrait of an author for us. Have any favorites youâd love to see immortalized? [Let us know](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about)
![](/webhook-uploads/1515699281741/SRoB_101_ChloeBenjamin.jpg)
**Thursday, January 11:** *The Immortalists* Reading**
Author Chloe Benjaminâs latest novel, *The Immortalists*, is about a mystical prophecy that foretells death. Itâs a clever addition to the genre of fiction based around the primal thought experiment centered around what you would do if you knew the exact date and time of your death.</description>

Music of the spheres Whenever I give an SFFH reading I also sing. And at their public readings, Pan Morigan and Andrea Hairston sing and play original songs inspired by Andreaâs novel Redwood and Wildfire.
No one knows how or why music so easily evokes emotions, but we three are certainly not above using it to do so.</description>

      <description>Friends, I&amp;rsquo;m going to make a bold announcement: It is quite possible that the best new series of 2018 from one of the big two &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; comics publishers has already made its debut. The book in question was published last Wednesday â the first new comics day of the year â and I can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking about it.
And it&amp;rsquo;s a comic book based on the old Hanna Barbera character Snagglepuss.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not very often that a new media outlet debuts in Seattle, so let&amp;rsquo;s pay attention to Unite Seattle, which went live today. They publish coverage of arts and news in Seattle with an eye toward LGBTQ issues â and they have a dedicated books page!
 The president of the United States of America is still whining about how he should be able to ban a book because he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like it.</description>

The woman at the door of the BLACK IMAGINATION: The States of Matter show at CORE Gallery asked me point blank: &amp;ldquo;are you a white man?&amp;rdquo; It was literally the first time in my entire life that anyone had ever asked me that question, and I had to pause for a minute.
&amp;ldquo;Uh, yes,&amp;rdquo; I eventually replied. I&amp;rsquo;d been invited to the opening night &amp;ldquo;celebration of Black joy&amp;rdquo; from four Black Seattle storytellers âÂ Natasha Marin, Imani Sims, Amber Flame, and Rachael Ferguson â and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been told about this part of the entry process.</description>

      <description>Seattle author [Laurie Frankel](http://www.lauriefrankel.net/)&#39;s novel [*This Is How It Always Is* was one of my very favorite novels of last year](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/all-happy-families-are-alike/). It&#39;s the gentle and big-hearted story of a mother who slowly realizes that her child is transgender, and the publisher made no secret of the fact that the story features at least some roots in reality: Frankel is the mother of a girl who was labeled a boy at birth.</description>

      <description>This might sound misanthropic, but itâs true: Some of the best nature writing that Iâve ever read is about cities. Edward Abbey â the shaggy, problematic voice of 1970s environmental activism â wrote fondly about New York City in such a way that youâd want to divide your time, as he did, between the city and the desert. He embraced the metropolis and celebrated its artificiality even as he cautiously guarded the natural peace of the desert, and he saw no hypocrisy in loving both.</description>

      <description>Letâs practice getting under the desk.
Letâs practice barricading the door, turning the blinds
in our eyes. Shhh now. Letâs demonstrate
in utter silence. Every desk is a bunker in disguise.
I must have walked a hundred miles
in a single afternoon. No one followed,
pacing myself. Sunlight stained the leaves like glass.
Vine maples tangled in an avalanche of shine.
The protocol is not what you think.
The protocol is run hide fight.</description>

Conon Parks returns as sponsor this week to share an excerpt from _Some Kind of Ending_, a collaboration with Mike MacNeil and illustrator Randy Jones. Set in Reagan-era Seattle, _Ending_ is a solid whole built from materials that always feel like they&#39;re about to drop you through the slats â sentences that steer you one way, then spin you like a bottle; sketches and scribbles that feel like they came straight from a zine.</description>

Members of Seattleâs own African-American Writers&#39; Alliance share their poetry in a laid-back setting. Have you noticed that there are more readings happening in the south side of Seattle these days?

Certain Trumpy wall-o-philiacs seem to have forgotten that immigration is at the very heart of the American ideal. Those same alt-right douchebags have armed themselves with bushels of doctored statistics and phony stories to gin up a hearty phobia of immigrants in white Americans. Their goal is to foment fear in an effort to other immigrants, to build them into a monstrous âthemâ that âweâ can then demonize and force out.</description>

December&#39;s theme: Wishful Thinking With my mom starting chemo again, I felt I should be publishing post-its from three years ago when she first had cancer. Or else something cozy, something seasonalâor even seasonal in the sense of the annual healthcare enrollment process, the post-its Iâve made out of anxiety and anger about the insurance system here.</description>

The book, which was scheduled to be published on Tuesday, has already made headlines after several gossipy excerpts were leaked online.
Greg Evans at Deadline reports that Henry Holt responded to Trump&amp;rsquo;s cease-and-desist in exactly the right way:</description>

One book is a collection of film criticism, and the other promises &amp;ldquo;Lindyâs grand theory of America,&amp;rdquo; which aims to explain our current cultural moment. See?

      <description>New Column! Every month, Olivia Waite pulls back the covers, revealing the very best in new, and classic, romance. We&#39;re extending a hand to you. Won&#39;t you take it?
This monthâs books are heavy on new and continuing series, so itâs a good time to look at how series work in romance.
Romance series, like mystery series, tend to be chains of standalone episodes. While the Fifty Shades phenomenon has made single-couple trilogies briefly A Thing (and in my humble opinion, A Super Boring Thing), more commonly each romance in a series will show one specific happy ending per bookâmeaning the reader whoâs missed the first one or two can still jump in with book three and have a reasonably good time.</description>

      <description>At the beginning of last night&amp;rsquo;s Reading Through It Book Club at Third Place Books Seward Park, one of the members of the book club had to ask a question that really should have been answered in the text: What, exactly, is an algorithm? Given that Cathy O&amp;rsquo;Neil&amp;rsquo;s Weapons of Math Destruction â is subtitled &amp;ldquo;How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;d think that an explanation of what, exactly, an algorithm is would be addressed in the book.</description>

      <description>This news got buried in the holiday onslaught, and it deserves room to breathe: The 2018 Seattle Reads selection is Yaa Gyasi&amp;rsquo;s novel Homegoing.
![](/webhook-uploads/1514955630474/homegoing_book_cover.jpg)
Seattle Reads is the Seattle Public Library program formerly known as If All Seattle Read the Same Book. Basically, the library gets a ton of copies of the book and hosts the selection&amp;rsquo;s author in library branches around the city. It&amp;rsquo;s an attempt to focus conversation and encourage civic discourse around the topic of a single novel.</description>

You could find books on the shelves at Louis Collins&#39;s Capitol Hill bookstore that existed nowhere else on earth.
Last night, the news started spreading on Facebook that Seattle used bookseller and Seattle Antiquarian Book Fair cofounder Louis Collins had died. Collins reportedly collapsed while walking his dog yesterday and had passed away before medics could arrive. By this morning, Collins&amp;rsquo;s Facebook page was filled with loving tributes posted by friends and antiquarian booksellers from around the world.</description>

What does it mean to represent a city, or a state, through poetry? To me, the role of poet laureate always felt like it would be too much responsibility. Writing a book of poetry is one thing, but to represent the varying perspectives of a community through poetry seems like a daunting task of representation. Seattle poet Shin Yu Pai talked to me over the phone last month about her tenure as Redmond&#39;s Poet Laureate âÂ what she learned, her successes and failures, and what she thinks her legacy might be.</description>

      <description>Over at the South Seattle Emerald, librarian Maggie Block published a spectacular roundup of radical books for young readers. You should read all three parts.
 Aside from the sad news of Sue Grafton&amp;rsquo;s passing, the biggest book news of last week was the publication of editorial notes for Milo Yiannopoulos&amp;rsquo;s book. An increasingly exhausted editor from Simon &amp;amp; Schuster left a series of increasingly angry notes on a draft of Yiannopoulos&amp;rsquo;s book, and now that whole document has been entered into the public record.</description>

      <description>When mystery author Sue Grafton died at the end of December, she famously left her Alphabet Series of mysteries unfinished. The summer of 2017 saw the publication of the penultimate volume in the series â Y Is for Yesterday â and Grafton hadnât even started writing Z Is for Zero, which she had always referred to as her final book. When announcing Graftonâs death, her daughter wrote that the series will remain unfinished: âAs far as we in the family are concerned, the alphabet now ends at Y.</description>

      <description>We drank too much.
Stayed up too late
watching elephants disappear.
The beer was flat. The ice
receded. The moon
tracked its footprints into the house.
Bases loaded, the batter struck out looking.
The kicker shanked the field goal wide
to the right. The wide receiver took a knee.
The drone strike found its target.
The drone strike missed its target.
The drone strike turned the village to dust.
We stood in line for hours</description>

      <description>Sponsor Northwest Associated Arts is back this week to bring yet another great event to the attention of our readers. This time, it&amp;rsquo;s a talk by Anne Lamott, coming up on April 8, 2018, at Benaroya Hall. It&amp;rsquo;s sure to be packed, given how beloved Lamott is, and after her recent sold-out interview with Hillary Clinton at the Paramount Theater.
This will be a good evening for writers and readers both: for followers of Lamott&amp;rsquo;s Bird by Bird writing guide (who are legion), and for lovers of her thoughtful, direct, and funny novels and essays.</description>

      <description>The second year of the post-Trump book club founded by the Seattle Review of Books and Seattle Weekly officially begins this Wednesday at Third Place Book Seward Park.
This month, for a change of pace, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about something not specifically related to Trump, Russia, or the Republican Party. Instead, our choice, Cathy O&amp;rsquo;Neil&amp;rsquo;s Weapons of Math Destruction, is about the rise of data and algorithmic systems. It&amp;rsquo;s probably hard for you to place a priority on data management when the whole world is falling apart around you.</description>

By an accident of timing, the Sunday Post has the last word on 2017 at the Seattle Review of Books. When I agreed to collate this weekly list, it was just after Donald Trump&amp;#8217;s election; the news cycle hadn&amp;#8217;t yet shifted into something past lightspeed.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s the second (&amp;ldquo;second annual&amp;rdquo;? dare we hope?) time Sedaris has put on this event: a week-long series of readings to workshop his newest project. This year, the book is Calypso, a collection of essays that won&amp;rsquo;t come out until summer. Seattle: you know how far away summer is. Don&amp;rsquo;t miss this chance for a preview.</description>

      <description>Did you know that local celebrity author Garth Stein hosts a book club at Third Place Books Seward Park on the last Wednesday of every month? Itâs true! And if youâre going to talk about the relative merits and failings of a book, why not have one of Seattleâs best-sellingest authors of all time to help guide you through it?
Tonightâs book club will discuss Brit Bennetâs debut novel, The Mothers.</description>

      <description>They talked Carol into dropping by. His coworkers met at the tavern once a week after their shift. The Graveyard Ghouls, they called themselves, and one of them even had patches made up, about three inches round, with a melting ghost face amidst a field of flame, clutching a wrench in its teeth. Carol wanted nothing to do with them normally, but agreed to stop in on account of it being Christmas Eve.</description>

December heralds best-of-year lists; when it comes to crime fiction, here are a few of my favorites from Irish critic [**Declan Burke**](https://crimealwayspays.blogspot.com/2017/12/feature-crime-novels-of-year-2017.html), _The New York Timesâs_ [**Marilyn Stasio**](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/books/review/best-crime-novels-2017.html), and _The Guardianâs_ [**Mark Lawson**](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/30/the-best-crime-books-and-thrillers-of-2017).  Reading around: new titles on the crime fiction scene ![](/webhook-uploads/1513741045606/AliveShapeColor.jpeg)

      <description>Natalie Dupille works along a wide spectrum of cartooning. Her diary comics â as seen in her most recent collection, October Diary â are sketchy and minimalist. It&amp;rsquo;s remarkable the information that Dupille&amp;rsquo;s cartooning can convey in with so little. Look at this image from the cover of October Diary:
Now consider how amazing it is that your eye can assess that image and immediately determine that it&amp;rsquo;s set at a rollerskating rink when all you can see is exactly six motion lines, an eighth of a disco ball, a single rollerskate wheel, and a background figure.</description>

      <description>Heyyyyy! Looks like 2018 is already guaranteed to be better than 2017: HarperCollins is publishing a long-lost anthropological text written by Their Eyes Were Watching God novelist Zora Neale Hurston in May. Kristian Wilson at Bustle says:
*Barracoon* is the story of Cudjo Lewis, the last person known to have survived the transatlantic slave trade. The book evolved out of Hurston&#39;s interviews with &#34;the Black community of Plateau, Alabama, which was founded by Cudjo Lewis and other ex-slaves from the ship that brought them to America.</description>

      <description>Last week, Sean Spicer posted this unbelievably stupid commentary on Instagram:
![](/webhook-uploads/1513668901987/aspicercarol.jpg)
Yes, apparently the idiot former White House spokesperson believes that A Christmas Carol is a book of Christmas carols. (The fact that Spicer, after being roundly mocked by the internet for many hours, changed the caption of his Instagram post to read âFDRs [sic] book [sic] of Dickenâs [sic] Christmas Carol [sic]â didnât much help matters.)
Spicerâs lack of awareness regarding A Christmas Carol reminded me of this blog post from a decade ago arguing that A Christmas Carol is intrinsically a conservative story.</description>

sunbathing on a felled tree

a silent confessional barred in by a community

      <description>As the first Poet Laureate of the city of Redmond, Shin Yu Pai worked hard to bring poetry out into the civic space. She created a beautiful and elaborate combination of poetry and fabric art in response to a hate crime. She had another poem animated and projected onto the side of a building. Sheâs demonstrated new ways that poets can interact with the public.
Now Paiâs term as Redmondâs Laureate has come to an end, and one of her final public exhibitions is available for viewing through this week.</description>

Friday, December 15: Four Seattle Poets
The last author reading at Elliott Bay Book Company for the year of 2017 is a stellar lineup of debut poets. You definitely know Jane Wong, whose Overpour was the first big debut of the year. And frequent readers of the site also know EJ Koh, whose A Lesser Love is a genius collection that spans love and war.</description>

Fashion: Beep beep. When I was little, my parents subscribed to Life magazine. It was our weekly dose of glossy photojournalism: enormous pages full of news and human interest stories. Though itâs been more than fifty years since I saw it, the Life article predicting 21st-century fashions still troubles my mindâs eye.</description>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1513230498869/4KidsHeader.png)
Writer Matthew Rosenberg and artist Tyler Bossâs 5-issue crime miniseries 4 Kids Walk Into a Bank is finally available in collected form, and you need to hunt down a copy immediately. Kids has so far managed to evade mainstream acclaim somehow, but its moment will come. The book is too goddamned enthusiastic, too exuberant, to ignore.
![](/webhook-uploads/1513230527258/4Kids0.png)
Kids is a comic about four children who become tangled in some very adult dealings, up to and including a bank robbery.</description>

      <description>As I reported last month, Zanadu Comics, the second-oldest comics store in Seattle, is closing in January. Tonight, you&amp;rsquo;ll have an opportunity to come start saying your goodbyes to the store. Zanadu employee Casey is hosting the final edition of Discussions from the Longtable, a comics conversation group, tonight at 6:30 pm. It promises to be an emotional time.
&amp;ldquo;Customers and employees would sit around the table and rant and rave about this or that while verging on sugar overdose from all the free candy&amp;hellip;I love connecting with customers on another level and sharing not only our mutual joy of comics, but the energy that lies behind the covers,&amp;rdquo; Casey writes in a Facebook post.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The castle grounds snarled with a wave of magically magnified wind,&amp;rdquo; the Harry Potter book begins. It continues,
The sky outside was a great black ceiling, which was full of blood. The only sounds drifting from Hagridâs hut were the disdainful shrieks of his own furniture. Magic: it was something that Harry Potter thought was very good. This is the opening passage of Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash, an artificial intelligence-created text generated out of the Harry Potter novels.</description>

      <description>Every Wednesday between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we&#39;re asking some of our favorite Seattle authors to recommend the books they&#39;re most excited to give as gifts this holiday. Our third author is novelist and cookbook author Bharti Kirchner.
![](/webhook-uploads/1513189845278/oldknives.png)
[*All the Old Knives*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250045430) by Olen Steinhauer is at once a spy novel and a heartbreaking love story. It takes place, surprisingly, over a long dinner in a fancy restaurant at Carmel-by-the-Sea. Thanks to Bharti Kirchner for her intriguing recommendation.</description>

      <description>As a rule, I&amp;rsquo;m against embedding threaded tweets onto a website. Besides the fact that a series of embedded tweets is pretty ugly, there&amp;rsquo;s also the fact that if a so-called news organization posts an entire thread by an author into a blog post, they are publishing an essay and they should pay the writer for their work.
But I recognize that many of you are not on Twitter â good choice, by the way â and you should read this amazing thread by the Seattle Public Library about their recent criminal justice, equity, and inclusion program.</description>

      <description>Congratulations to Seattle poet Jane Wong, who won the 2017 James W. Ray Distinguished Artist Award. The award is $50,000 â one of the biggest available to writers in the area â and Wong will have the opportunity to present her work at the Frye Art Museum. We&amp;rsquo;ll have more news about that exhibit when it gets closer to happening.

      <description>Letâs begin with bark beetles, sugar pines and sap. I am twelve,
and as high as I can get in the tree behind our double-wide
mobile home. Iâm peeling bark back by my bare hands
to see bug tracks, small iris-like engravements canyoned
into the treeâs meat like a secret message or a promise
from the maker of trees: Your eye will not purple
like your motherâs. Her cries are faint from this lofty height &amp;mdash;</description>

      <description>A million thanks to Arundel and Chatwin Books for returning to sponsor the site this week and for tipping us (and you) off to their holiday party, coming up this Friday. As always, the celebration is shaping up to be something special, particularly this year&amp;rsquo;s featured guest: Carl Montford, well-known local wood engraver and extraordinary artist and craftsman.
Montford&amp;rsquo;s prints are on display all month at Arundel&amp;rsquo;s Pioneer Square shop, and you should absolutely stop in and see them (and get some Christmas shopping done while you&amp;rsquo;re there; originals are shockingly affordable).</description>

      <description>In the wrong hands, Matthew McIntoshâs second novel, theMystery.doc, could be a murder weapon. The thing is immense â over 1500 pages, a giant blue bludgeon of a book. Once you stop wondering at the sheer size of the thing, your second question is probably: is it any good? And, uh, can you close Instagram and set down your phone long enough to read the damn thing?
Youâll have to trust me when I say that theMystery.</description>

      <description>So as you probably know by now, writer Geoff Johns and artist Gary Frank are publishing a sequel to Watchmen titled Doomsday Clock. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what to say about the first issue of the book, except it is drenched in nostalgia. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of book that ten thousand teenage geeks dreamed they&amp;rsquo;d get to write after they read Watchmen for the first time. Doomsday Clock reads like a cover version of Watchmen, a mimicking of Alan Moore&amp;rsquo;s tone without the intellect to back it up.</description>

      <description>Last night marked the one-year anniversary of the Reading Through It Book Club. The anthology we were there to discuss, Tales of Two Americas, was a controversial topic. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think it was especially interesting, but others considered it to be a worthy selection packed with important perspectives. The best pieces in the book â by Karen Russell, Edwidge Danticat, and Chris Offutt â inspired some conversation, but the book club&amp;rsquo;s collective mind kept wandering.</description>

      <description>William Gass, one of the most challenging and brilliant writers of the 20th century, has died, Dalkey Archive reports. I will never understand why Gass&amp;rsquo;s 1995 novel The Tunnel, about Nazism and academia and guilt and procrastination, is not considered one of the major books of our time, alongside its peers like Infinite Jest and Gravity&amp;rsquo;s Rainbow and The Last Samurai.
My introduction to Gass was a hilarious quote from this Paris Review interview, which I&amp;rsquo;ll share with you now:</description>

      <description>Ta-Nehisi Coates&#39;s We Were Eight Years in Power is a pensive, complex book. Interlacing memoir and essay, Coates reports on America after Barack Obama&#39;s presidency with nuance and emotional weight. This the best work I have read from him.
And yet _Eight Years in Power_ has been attacked by many online as agitprop with biblical pretensions that aids and abets Nazism. When Coates analyzes the symbolism of Barack Obamaâs success to a black America that gave him 94 percent of their vote, Dan McLaughlin says Coates is [one with Richard Spencer](http://www.</description>

      <description>Every Wednesday between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we&#39;re asking some of our favorite Seattle authors to recommend the books they&#39;re most excited to give as gifts this holiday. Our second author is short story writer and novelist Richard Chiem.
I recommend [*The Passion According to G.H.*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780811219686), by Clarice Lispector, for that weird strange someone in your life. It&#39;s about a maid who accidentally kills a cockroach, and then goes through a stunning and hellish existential dreamscape.</description>

      <title>A fairy tale of New York</title>

      <description>Pluta, the teenager at the heart of Seattle novelist Anca SzilÃ¡gyiâs debut Daughters of the Air, has all the makings of a fairy tale protagonist. Her life seems cursed: Her father disappears. She wanders into the world alone, meeting monsters. She uncovers her own hidden power. Love pushes her onward, but always seems to be just out of reach.
But this isnât a fairy tale; itâs fiction, but it feels as real and as insistent as the vein pulsing just over your right eye.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I told you that Arizona poet Natalie Diaz is in town for a fantastic new series of events celebrating indigenous women writers called Poetry Across the Nations.
What I failed to tell you was that Diaz&amp;rsquo;s first Seattle event this week is tonight at the downtown branch of the Seattle Public Library. She&amp;rsquo;ll be appearing in conversation with great literary editor John Freeman in a discussion about inequality and invisibilty in modern America.</description>

      <description>Itâs summer in Sanger, California,
and thereâs a volcano
between my motherâs lips
as she stuffs me
into tiny shoes and a cotton dress.
Ashes powder my pointy bits &amp;mdash;
nose, elbows, training bra.
Instead of running in grapevines,
I sit in mahogany pews
at a Methodist church and stare
at the heavily blushed face
of my grandmother &amp;mdash;
her gray head juts
out her coffin
like a matchstick from a box.</description>

      <description>This morning, Artist Trust announced that Seattle writer E. Lily Yu is the recipient of this year&#39;s [Gar LaSalle Storyteller Award](https://www.garlasalle.com/2017/07/artist-trust-lasalle-storyteller-award/). This is a fairly new award in Washington State&#39;s arts scene, but it&#39;s a mighty one â it pays $10,000 to its winner, with no strings attached. In 2015, Anca L.SzilÃ¡gyi was the first Gar LaSalle recipient, and that prize money seems to have paid off; her debut novel, *Daughters of the Air*, is [launching tomorrow night at the Hotel Sorrento](http://hotelsorrento.</description>

âThe lives of Native women are not valued greatly in the Americas,â Arizona poet Natalie Diaz explains. This is not just a matter of feeling underappreciated; literal lives are at stake. âThe rates of Native femicide in North and South America are astronomical, and also invisible in regard to mainstream media discussion.â
Part of the reason these lives are being snuffed out, Diaz says, is because Native women feel isolated and removed from the culture.</description>

Trapped: The Grenfell Tower Story Tom Lamont&amp;#8217;s account of the Grenfell Tower fire is riveting and wrenching. It&amp;#8217;s not a political examination, but a human one, a set of interlocking stories by residents and firefighters who lived through the night.</description>

      <description>Our manic relationship to memoir has already circled through many shame spirals in this reality-hungry culture, and the dog memoir genre â from the stirring Hachikoto books to the feel-good Marley and Me franchise â is so oversaturated that every purchase comes with complimentary eye-rolls. Jill Abramson, of The New York Times, was slaughtered in reviews of The Puppy Diaries, partially because she expressed her fantasy of sharing monumental bylines with her canine partner, Scout.</description>

The first issue of Now, a quarterly comics anthology from Fantagraphics, begins with a text page that falls just shy of manifesto territory. It&amp;rsquo;s by Now editor Eric Reynolds, and it argues that &amp;ldquo;The anthology format can be an inherent force for good.&amp;rdquo;
Reynolds makes a compelling argument. Anthologies are a great way for young cartoonists to get exposure and to experiment with styles without committing to a longform project.</description>

      <description>This Saturday, December 2nd, Redmond Poet Laureate Shin Yu Pai will be presenting new work at the Redmond Lights holiday festival. Pai has written a special poem for the occasion recounting Redmond&amp;rsquo;s logging history and celebrating the city&amp;rsquo;s attempts to regrow its gorgeous tree canopy. Additionally, Seattle designer Michael Barakat has animated the poem, and it will be projected on the side of City Hall as part of the festivities.</description>

Over Thanksgiving break, I did something unusual: I played a video game. It only took about an hour and a half to play from start to finish, and (happily) it required absolutely zero hand-eye coordination. The game is called Far from Noise, and it&amp;rsquo;s available pretty much everywhere you play games: on Steam, on the PS4, or â and this is how I played it âÂ on Apple devices.</description>

      <description>Every Wednesday between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we&#39;re asking some of our favorite Seattle authors to recommend the books they&#39;re most excited to give as gifts this holiday. Our first author is novelist Anca SzilÃ¡gyi.
This spring, I cackled all the way through Elaine Dundy&#39;s novel [*The Dud Avocado*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781590172322), the story of Sally Jay Gorce, a 21-year-old American in 1950s Paris who is a delightful hot mess. It&#39;s my kind of &#34;</description>

      <description>These events came in too late for me to add to our readings calendar, but you should definitely know about them: This coming Sunday, December 3rd, Seattle Civic Poet Anastacia-Renee is hosting two very different events.
The first event, Speak to Me! is billed as &amp;ldquo;an intergenerational monthly reading series showcasing emerging and seasoned poets,&amp;rdquo; and the reading is &amp;ldquo;followed by a 30-minute optional writing workshop facilitated by Anastacia-Renee and visiting workshop facilitators.</description>

      <description>Iâll fight to the grave on this: Joe Biden was one of the most effective vice presidents in the history of the United States.
Itâs hard to recall now, but in 2008 Bidenâs experience and genial demeanor afforded a small but important subset of white American voters with the confidence to vote for the first black president. Once in office, though, Biden transformed into a very different figure than Token White Grandpa: he became the Crazy Uncle of the White House, the figure whoâs prone to blurting out what everyone else was thinking.</description>

      <description>To make the banana naked, crack
its neck and peel its jacket. To make
the bed naked, throw back the sheet
and the cotton blanket and the down one, too,
along with whatever&amp;rsquo;s been whispered to
them in the damp minutes around midnight.
To make the dog naked, let the mange
rake and ravage, the tiny mites like
humpbacked handmaids, plucking a hair,
dropping it overboard, scraping away the skin.</description>

      <description>This week, the Seattle Review of Books is sponsored by Paul Mullin, playwright, poet, and creator/curator of the Loud Mouth Lit reading series. We&amp;rsquo;re infinitely grateful to Paul for supporting the site and for sharing a chapter from his memoir, The Starting Gate, with our readers. The excerpt is a great standalone story: the down-and-dirty (or up-and-clean) on the dangers of washing windows on a New York highrise when you&amp;rsquo;re a young writer with three jobs and no time to sleep.</description>

**Monday, November 27th: *Obama: an Intimate Portrait* Reading**
Pete Souza was President Barack Obamaâs official photographer, and the photos that heâs captured in that role have defined Americaâs relationship to Obama. These are photos that will last forever, long after the horrendous current political moment has passed. And Souza has been trolling Donald Trump quite effectively on social media in the last few months by posting photographic proof of Obamaâs competence whenever Trump messes something up.</description>

      <description>Andy Weirâs The Martian is a rare self-publishing success story. The Martian first began on a blog, in which Weir presented a series of problems relating to life on Mars followed with a cliffhanger, only to solve the cliffhanger in the next installment. And it must be said that The Martian is a ton of fun to read â basically, the dictionary definition of âpage-turner.â Somehow, The Martian even defied the odds of adaptation, becoming a phenomenally watchable movie, too.</description>

What Do We Do With the Art of Monstrous Men? This is the must-read of the week, and not just because it&amp;#8217;s Claire Dederer, which means it&amp;#8217;s sharp and funny and expresses anger and feelings in the most satisfyingly vulnerable-but-also-take-no-prisoners way possible.</description>

November&#39;s Theme: Same Day, Different Year Looking through a decade of post-its, sometimes I notice weird patterns. For November, I started with the dates they would be published at the beginning and end of the month, and chose drawings from those same dates in two different years.</description>

      <description>The Pacific Northwest is home to many unique eccentrics, but there was one character who, if you encountered him, you never forgot. He went by the name Symptomatic Nerve Gas, and no, this is not some kind of sub-par Vonnegut fiction. He was a real man, a Korean War vet, apparently, or Viet Nam, perhaps, or maybe not a vet at all, depending on who you believe &amp;mdash; the narratives are mixed and told in different ways depending on when you met and talked to him.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow, of course, is Thanksgiving. The day after that is Black Friday. Don&amp;rsquo;t shop anywhere on Black Friday; it&amp;rsquo;s a mess out there. But on Saturday, you should go shop at your favorite small business, because it&amp;rsquo;s Small Business Saturday. Small businesses are essential to local economies; studies have shown that while only 14 cents of every dollar spent at a chain recirculate through the local economy, nearly 50 cents of every dollar spent at a small business stays in the local economy.</description>

      <description>Reza Aslan&#39;s new book [*God: A Human History*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/246531/god-by-reza-aslan/9780553394726/) is a remarkable document. It lays out the entirety of human&#39;s relationship with the divine, using athropological and archaeological documentation. From pantheism to ancestor worship to monotheism, Aslan examines the way that a concept of a higher power has evolved right alongside human civilization â and also helped shape our modern world. Aslan was in Seattle last week with Seattle Arts and Lectures.</description>

Seattle author Juan Carlos Reyesâs novella A Summerâs Lynching begins with a city:
After all, there will always be places on Earth where elevated things happen, where few people call each other by name, where voices sprinkle across pavement and seep into cracks, where stories are codified in the song of humming air conditioning vents and whistling manhole covers, flooded gutters and opening soda cans, aging Camaros and nagging door bells, store-light gnats and encaged dogs, pigeons smothering pavement in shadowy monsters and ten year-old littering sidewalks, and near endless repair projects that, in cycles of upended sewers and streets, feign renovations that never improve a city.</description>

      <description>The cantaloupe sits
on the counter like
a little moon

off its course.
Outside, grassy
undertones
and modest navel,
inside, a wall
of pale orange fruit
and inside that
a child&amp;rsquo;s night terror
of seeds and guts and string.
It is no matter:
The kitchen has
its own astronomy.
The instant the cutting edge
pierces the rind &amp;mdash; flesh
yielding to steel &amp;mdash;
the gig is up.
We simply eat.</description>

      <description>If you like epic dark fantasy, stop reading this post and go immediately to the sample chapter from sponsor Allen Batchelder&amp;rsquo;s Steel, Blood &amp;amp; Fire. You&amp;rsquo;ll find the not-so-heroic hero Tarmun Vykers sitting in the stocks, at the mercy of an entire village he&amp;rsquo;s mysteriously offended. It&amp;rsquo;s an irresistible opening, and so are the cameos by Aoife, a woman on a secret and possibly deadly mission, and Long Pete, a man whose destiny (at least for today) lies at the bottom of a flask.</description>

As part of their ongoing Inside/Out program, Town Hall asks the Columbia/Hillman City communities what they can be doing to assist inclusivity and togetherness in their events. This is worth attending even if youâre unfamiliar with Town Hall. This part of town has been changing for years, and it needs to reassess its cultural needs and desires before it moves into the future.

You know who we think are the best people in the world? A hint: it starts with _s_ and ends with _ponsors_. We owe a huge enthusiastic thank you to the more than sixty sponsors who&#39;ve signed up to support us since we launched. By putting their projects in front of our readers, it means that we can pay writers, which is pretty dope. Also, unlike some advertising, our sponsors are pretty amazing and interesting &amp;mdash; you actually _want_ to read what their offering.</description>

Humanities Washington and the Washington State Arts Commission (ArtsWA) are excited to announce that Claudia Castro Luna, a prominent Seattle poet and teacher, has been appointed the fifth Washington State Poet Laureate by Governor Jay Inslee. Castro Luna takes over from current state Poet Laureate Tod Marshall on March 1st of next year.

      <description>Say youâre friends with a writer. Say one day your writer friend asks you to lunch. You ask whatâs going on. She tells you, âIâm working on a book.â A book, you reply, thatâs great! Whatâs it about?
âWell, hereâs the thing,â she says. âIâm writing a sequel to The Wind in the Willows.â
Hereâs where youâd gently try to convince your friend that sheâs making a horrendous mistake, that the world doesnât need a sequel to Kenneth Grahameâs beloved childrenâs classic.</description>

Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner published an open letter this week about the paper&amp;#8217;s history and commitment to holding power&amp;#8217;s feet to the fire. It&amp;#8217;s a stirring account of the tough choices a newspaper makes â the risks that journalists face, to their livelihoods and persons, when they oppose the dominant political and social thinking.</description>

**Iâm a white writer, and Iâm writing a historical novel. One of the characters â a villain, I guess youâd say â is racist as fuck. This is important to the plot.**

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the 1973 Hal Ashby film The Last Detail, I&amp;rsquo;d urge you to do so. Detail, starring Jack Nicholson, Otis Young, and Randy Quaid as young Navy men on a road trip before one of them is put in the brig for a long time, is one of the most quintessentially American films I think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. It&amp;rsquo;s an ambitious, dark, funny film that name-checks Billy Budd and questions our assumptions about freedom and duty.</description>

Ben Affleck is the perfect Batman for the era of Donald Trump. Heâs huge and he often looks like he can barely move his arms. The nose on his mask is doing something weird that looks odder and odder the more you stare at it. Heâs prone to saying gruff things that donât really make sense. His plans involve talking a lot and not doing anything of value, and they almost always result in the situation getting worse.</description>

      <description>One of Seattle&amp;rsquo;s oldest comics shops is set to close. Zanadu Comics posted on Facebook yesterday:
The good guys donât always win. Unfortunately, our world is harsher than that of comic books and after 42 years of battling in the trenches of comic book retail, Zanadu Comics will be closing its doors at the end of January 2018. Believe us when we say that this decision was not made lightly. There are hundreds of reasons we could list, but the truth is that the money coming in does not equal the money going out.</description>

      <description>As the title of Carmen Maria Machadoâs debut collection suggests, the stories in Her Body and Other Parties are about womenâs lives and bodies, which means that, above all, men must read them.
The blurbs on the book are numerous and rightfully ecstatic from writers of no small repute, and itâs a good sign that half of the jacket endorsements come from male writers. Not that their opinions matter more than the notable women who also praised the book.</description>

      <description>Congratulations to Tim Lennon, who was announced as the Executive Director of LANGSTON, a new Seattle nonprofit that will &amp;ldquo;guide programming intended to strengthen and advance community through Black arts and culture.&amp;rdquo; I worked with Lennon at Elliott Bay Book Company right after he moved to town in 2001 and we&amp;rsquo;ve been friends ever since, so I can&amp;rsquo;t claim any objectivity, but his career in the years since âÂ at One Reel, heading up Vera Project, working at the Office of Arts &amp;amp; Culture â demonstrates that he&amp;rsquo;ll be excellent at this.</description>

A city never looks so noble, or so full of potential, as when youâre viewing it through Jane Jacobsâs eyes. For the last week or so, Iâve been walking through Seattle while listening to an audio recording of the 50th anniversary edition of Jane Jacobsâs The Death and Life of American Cities. Itâs an experience Iâd recommend to anyone.
When youâre walking in downtown Seattle, Jacobs becomes your personal tour guide, pointing out areas (like the always-vibrant stretch of Pike and Pine north of Broadway) where pedestrians activate and enliven a space through work and play, and critiquing other areas (like the weird airy mall at 6th Ave &amp;amp; Union) that seem to push humans away with a vague sense of dread and alienation.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time
an accountant there was
who numbers loved
And every day
numbers flew in
and numbers floated away
and days were numbers
and also gloves and boots and
numbers counted the noodles
in his soup as he ate it
Until one day began
the numbers to slip
their shapes, to stand
up off their stools, to spool
into nests of number
and start to nap
And grew afraid the accountant</description>

When Kelly Davio left Seattle in 2015, she was the most requested name for [our Exit Interview series](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/09/exit-interview-kelly-davio-is-moving-to-london/) â a tribute to how much this community hated to see her go. We haven&#39;t lured her back yet, but she&#39;s here this week in spirit to sponsor the site and share an excerpt from her latest book: *It&#39;s Just Nerves: Notes on a Disability*.
Davio is a poet, an essayist, and poetry editor at the Tahoma Literary Review.</description>

Pie and Whiskey is a popular reading series in Spokane and Missoula. Headlined by ex-Seattle author Kate Lebo and Sam Ligon, the series offers writers that most blessed of gifts: a theme.
Themes are a blessing, but some themes are too broad to work with, and others are too specific. Ask ten thousand writers to come up with stories about âwar,â for instance, and youâll get a spray of stories in response that will be impossible to categorize.</description>

The Unforgiving Minute Laurie Penny delivers a not-that-gentle-but-still-sorta-loving ass-kicking to men who are worried that the so very long overdue public outrage over sexual assault by men in positions of power feels awkward and uncomfortable.</description>

Friday, November 10th: Fresh Complaint Reading Jeffrey Eugenides is a stone-cold genius writer of novels. If you havenât read Middlesex, youâre missing one of the finest American novels of the last twenty years; youâll likely be hooked from the very first description of a fire tearing along a waterfront.</description>

Magellanic pseudopods and chipped funkleweed Food in space! It isnât always as vividly and goofily named as the cafeteria offerings listed above, lifted from the infamous Pel Torroâs godawful novel Galaxy 666. In fact their polar opposite, the tasteless and efficient food pills are fairly ubiquitous; they make an appearance as early as the Victorian SF story âThe Senatorâs Daughterâ and are heavily featured in Twentieth Century media such as the cartoon series The Jetsons.</description>

Regardless of whether an author is a bright debut or a seasoned veteran, the experience of finally sending oneâs book into the world brings with it weeks (if not months) of excitement, anxiety, and hard work. My third novel, Jade City, will be published this month, and in the frenetic run-up to launch, Iâve been thinking about how much authors depend on our families, friends, and fans during this time â in more ways than you know!</description>

      <description>The newest issue of Marvel&amp;rsquo;s The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl is billed as a &amp;ldquo;special &amp;lsquo;zine&amp;rsquo; issue,&amp;rdquo; which immediately grabbed my attention. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of alternative sensibilities applied to superhero comics â the Coober Skeber &amp;ldquo;Marvel Benefit Issue&amp;rdquo; is one of my all-time favorites, and DC&amp;rsquo;s Bizarro Comics trade paperback is a lot of fun, too âÂ and while I haven&amp;rsquo;t read that many Squirrel Girl comics, the character is an appealing meta-take on the superhero genre, and I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to read more.</description>

      <description>Last month, New Zealand author [Nic Low](http://www.dislocated.org/) came to Seattle for almost two weeks as part of an ongoing native author exchange program facilitated by the [Seattle City of Literature](http://seattlecityoflit.org/) organization. As part of [Lit Crawl](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/10/20/last-nights-lit-crawl-was-worth-braving-the-traffic-apocalypse/), Low appeared onstage at the Hugo House with Seattle author Willie Fitzgerald. The morning after Lit Crawl, he met with me to share his thoughts about the trip, and how Christchurch and Seattle could grow together as literary cities.</description>

Youâll be hearing a lot more about it from me in the coming months, so for now Iâll just say this: itâs set in 15th century Spain and those of you whoâve been pining for more genies ought to be pleased.  This is pretty cool: Hugo House and the Poetry Foundation are joining forces with poet Natalie Diaz to put on a series called &amp;ldquo;Poetry Across the Nations, a new community outreach program facilitated by Native women, on December 6â8.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, actor Charlene Yi told a story about comedian David Cross. She recalled on social media that the first time she met Cross, a decade ago, he said several racist comments to her. Yi was offended, but Cross at that time was a popular celebrity, and she felt too powerless to respond.
Cross responded by saying âI do not remember it like she remembers it,â and that âI am NOT accusing Charlene of lying and Iâm truly sorry if I hurt her,â but he concludes âI am not a racist nor a bully and loathe them in real life.</description>

of the stage. Our eyes are dry, our knees numb,
our temples dull. Nothing is left to be begun:
No tearing at the breasts of hairdoed birds,
no smooth unscrolling of the Italian words
for love and loss. No garden froth, no castle wall
to knock the sword against, no impossible
extension of the slenderest ankle in its arc.</description>

      <title>What we saw (and loved) at Short Run</title>
      <link>http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/what-we-saw-and-loved-at-short-run/</link>

      <description>This report was written by Paul Constant, Martin McClellan, and Dawn McCarra Bass.
Last yearâs Short Run Comix &amp;amp; Arts Festival was the weekend before the presidential election, and most people we talked to about it can only recall the convention as a blur preceding one of the worst weeks in recent memory. Perhaps for that reason, people seemed extra-ready to have a doubly good time at this yearâs Short Run.</description>

      <title>Event of the Week: Chief Seattle and the Town that Took His Name reading at Seattle Public Library</title>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1509683362617/seattle.jpeg)
David M. Buergeâs Chief Seattle and the Town That Took His Name is billed as âthe first thorough account of Chief Seattle and his times,â a âcomprehensive storyâ of the colonization of Seattle that Buerge has supposedly been working on for two full decades.
So why has it taken so long to finally get the biography that Chief Seattle deserves? For one thing, many of the accounts are contradictory and passed down orally from generation to generation.</description>

      <description>Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles good for slow consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if thatâs your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also look through the archives.
To the Lady Who Mistook Me for the Help at the National Book Awards Poet Patrick Rosal issues an epistolary rebuke to a woman who took him for a server at a black-tie event, in a series of letters addressed to a subtly shifting cast of one â &amp;#8220;Dear lady,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Dear Miss Lady at Fancy Table 24,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Dear _______ &amp;#8221; (we both know who you are).</description>

Tomorrow is one of the best days in the literary Seattle calendar year: Short Run happens at Seattle Center, both in the Fisher Pavillion (where exhibitors will be showing thousands of independantly produced books and comics and art) and at the Vera Project (where programming including panels and interviews will play out all day.) It runs from 11 to 6, and it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely free!
But before you go, you might want to learn about some of the authors you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to meet at the show.</description>

Dear Cienna,

You can find her booth in the show and sheâll also be performing in *The Midnight Variety Hour*, described as an âactive participatory performanceâ at the Vera Project at noon.

      <description>Youâve seen these kinds of juxtapositions before: someone will place a photograph of a specific location from a century ago up against a contemporary photograph. Usually, the intent is to make a reader shake their head and wonder about the horrible price of progress: a beautiful old Victorian home in the âbeforeâ frame has given way to an ugly strip mall in the âafter,â for instance. A field becomes a gas station.</description>

      <description>Every month, Olivia Waite pulls back the covers, revealing the very best in new, and classic, romance. We&#39;re extending a hand to you. Won&#39;t you take it? You can also peruse the [_Kissing Books_ historical archive](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/kissing-books/).
People will tell you romance is anti-feminist. Others will tell you that romance is definitely, strongly feminist. The weird part is: thanks to the genreâs vast and complicated history, both are sort of right. Paradoxes: such fun.</description>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1509075556925/ragnarok.jpg)
Full disclosure: the press screening for *Thor: Ragnarok* ended in a modest kind of film-reviewing disaster: the audio for the movie cut out about five minutes before the end of the film due to an automation problem with the digital print. And then the theater staff couldn&#39;t go back and show us the conclusion of the film again because the film studios have locked down their digital prints with copyright-control software.</description>

You might know Nilsen from his Peanuts-meets-Tolstoy epic bird comic Big Questions, or his heart-rending memoir of grief and loss, Don&amp;rsquo;t Go Where I Can&amp;rsquo;t Follow. But at Short Run, he&amp;rsquo;s debuting his latest ambitious project: the first issue of a projected series called Tongues.
Nilsen describes Tongues as &amp;ldquo;loosely based on a trilogy by the ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus, of which two plays are lost and only dimly reconstructed by historians.</description>

      <description>It is incredibly difficult to explain oneâs own ignorance to someone else.
At last nightâs Reading Through It book group at Third Place Books Seward Park, many of us used the phrase âpunched in the gutâ to describe Carol Andersonâs brilliant White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide. The book, which documents the institutional history of white supremacy of the United States, lays out the many ways white America has systematically made even existing while being black an illegal act.</description>

      <description>In the midst of all the exciting City of Literature news yesterday, this piece of news didn&amp;rsquo;t get the attention it deserves: David Lasky and Mairead Case have been selected to create a fictionalized graphic novel about the beautiful old Georgetown Steam Plant. (We told you about the open call for Seattle cartoonists five months ago.) Case and Lasky will be blogging about the experience of creating the graphic novel on the new site Steam Plant Graphic Novel: The Blog!</description>

      <description>Several summers ago, an architect contacted me to ask whether I could help with a curious discovery. In the backyard of an almost-hundred-year-old house in Seattleâs ChinatownâInternational District, hidden under overgrown shrubbery, workers uncovered a yellowish-tan oblong stone. Carved on one side, in English, was âShinjiro Honda/Died Sept. 3, 1942/Age 65â; on the other was Kanji script that translated to âSeptember 3, 1942/This is the grave of the deceased Shinjiro Honda/Lived 65 years/Shizuoka prefecture, Hamamatsu city.</description>

      <description>Ever since the dawn of comics, cartoonists have tried to break free from the bounds of the page. Those cartoonists have discovered that comics grant them mastery over two dimensions, but they are powerless in the third dimension: you can do anything with width and height in comics, but it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to add depth.
Read any comic and youâll find evidence of cartoonists pushing back against this fundamental limitation. Youâll find figures bursting free from the constricting lines of the panel.</description>

      <description>This is a big goddamned day in Seattle history, and so for posterity I want to make sure Seattle City of Literature&amp;rsquo;s announcement is in the public record.
(SeattleâOct. 31, 2017) The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) announced it designated Seattle as a City of Literature in the Creative Cities Network. Seattle joins an international network of 116 member cities from 54 countries that promote socio-economic and cultural tourism in the developed and developing world through creative industries.</description>

      <description>We just got maybe the most welcome press release in the history of press releases. It begins, &amp;ldquo;The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) announced it designated Seattle as a City of Literature in the Creative Cities Network.&amp;rdquo; As a City of Literature, Seattle joins more than 20 other cities around the world in the network, including Baghdad, Dublin, ReykjavÃ­k, Prague, and Montevideo.
This is the culmination of a years-long process; the bid for Seattle as a City of Literature began in 2013 and it has seen wholesale staffing changes, survived four different mayors, and the US&amp;rsquo;s withdrawal from UNESCO in the intervening years.</description>

      <description>Poetry Northwest is announcing a new prize, in honor of poet Joan Swift, who passed away earlier this year at the age of 90.
&amp;ldquo;The Joan Swift Memorial Prize is the brainchild of Esther Altshul Helfgott, longtime curator of the It&amp;rsquo;s About Time reading series in Ballard,&amp;rdquo; said Poetry Northwest executive editor Kevin Craft (Helfgott was also our Poet in Residence for September this year). &amp;ldquo;When Joan died earlier this year, we first heard the sad news from Esther.</description>

To get my lighter from the Jeep &amp;amp;
Walking past I see a lady
Leaning against a silver car in front of the bldg
Sheâs on the phone
Sheâs talking
&amp;amp; leaning is that her car
A crow is very upset
Calling &amp;amp; cawing &amp;amp; gargling it seems
A branch in the tree the lady
Does not notice me I see
Her pink hood &amp;amp; black hair her</description>

      <description>**Monday, October 30: *Leonardo Da Vinci* Reading**
Walter Isaacson has made a career out of writing about geniuses. Heâs written books about Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Benjamin Franklin. His latest book is a biography of one of historyâs most important geniuses: Leonardo Da Vinci. How does one man paint several of the most recognizable paintings of all time, make world-changing discoveries in anatomy and biology, and craft a flying machine in just one lifetime?</description>

Every year, the Short Run Comix &amp;amp; Arts Festival gets a little larger. This year&amp;rsquo;s happening at Seattle Center on Saturday, November 4th from 11 am to 6 pm, is way bigger than last year&amp;rsquo;s mammoth show.
And this isn&amp;rsquo;t some size queen trip: the additions are all high-quality affairs. The main floor of Short Run will be essentially the same: 270 exhibitors spread across the floor of Fisher Pavillion.</description>

On Being Driven Kristen Millares Young read this essay at Lit Crawl to a packed room held silent by the story: an ill-met drive on a small island in the Bahamas; a trade of threats; a tangle of considerations involving sex, race, money, and history.</description>

      <description>Over on our Instagram page, weâre posting a weekly installation from Clare Johnsonâs Post-it Note Project, a long running daily project. Hereâs her wrap-up and statement from Septemberâs posts.
October&#39;s Theme: Fancy Dress When I lived in the UK, wearing costumes was called fancy dress. Fancy dress parties, Halloween in general, seemed to mostly be a thing with university students. Looking at post-its from my life back in Seattle, I notice a lot more fancy dressâcostumes, but also weddings, where other people are truly wearing fancy dresses.</description>

      <description>Victor LaValle is one of the most underappreciated novelists in America today. His debut novel The Ecstatic was less a shaky first outing and more a spectacular announcement of a singular talent. His last three novels âÂ Big Machine, The Devil in Silver, and The Ballad of Black Tom â have addressed America&amp;rsquo;s complicated relationship with race through the lens of horror fiction. (And before you ask, LaValle began exploring this relationship years before Get Out was anything more than a figment of Jordan Peele&amp;rsquo;s imagination.</description>

Ugh, looks like James Frey&#39;s &#34;memoir,&#34; *A Million Little Pieces*, is [about to become a movie](http://www.pajiba.com/trade_news/sam-and-aaron-taylorjohnson-will-adapt-controversial-but-wildly-overrated-memoir-for-the-big-screen.php). The book, which unhelpfully and unthoughtfully applies toxic masculinity to questions of addiction and substance abuse, became famous when it was selected as an Oprah&#39;s Book Club pick back when Oprah&#39;s Book Club was a thing. And then it became *even more famous* when it was revealed that Frey made up a lot of the book.</description>

      <description>When Tara Atkinson lost her favorite bookstore, she decided to do something about it. After the ferociously independent Pilot Books closed down, Atkinson and her friends came together to create the APRIL (Authors, Publishers, and Readers of Independent Literature) Festival, which ran longer than Pilot Books and, arguably, made more of a mark on the city then the bookstore which inspired it.
Atkinson was not just a curator of the APRIL Festival&amp;rsquo;s wildly entertaining events.</description>

A new magazine about mental health, [_Anxy_](http://www.anxymag.com), is currently [running a Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redindhi/anxy-the-workaholism-issue?ref=6zei08) to fund its second issue. The name is so odd that it takes a moment to reckon with it &amp;mdash; but in a world of short and frivolous names for apps and startup, _Anxy_ feels weighted with meaning.
I asked Anxy Editor-in-Chief Bobbie Johnson &amp;mdash; who was a founder of Matter Magazine, and went on to work for Medium after their acquisition of Matter, so no stranger to digital publishing &amp;mdash; why print was the right format.</description>

      <description>The word Iâve most often applied to our October poet in residence, Kary Wayson, is âpatience.â Waysonâs poetry feels deliberate and constructed in a way that the work of many Seattle poets does not. Every word is there for a reason, and if you were to extract even one syllable, the whole thing would crumble to a pile of typeface at the bottom of the page. In a literary scene that tends toward expressionistic and reactionary poetry, Wayson stands out as a contemplative figure.</description>

      <description>Do you need a book recommendation to send your worst cousin on her birthday? Is it okay to read erotica on public transit? Cienna Madrid can help. Send your Help Desk Questions to advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.
Dear Cienna,
**When I was a kid my parents always had one of those big thick 70s novels going. *The Godfather*. *Roots*. *Shogun*. I was too young to read them then, but I&#39;m thinking that this might be a good time to dig into all those thick, engrossing historical stories.</description>

      <description>Something different in our Lit Crawl coverage this year. Instead of grouping together in an inconvenient cluster, we split up. Paul Constant, Martin McClellan, and Dawn McCarra Bass all attended different readings in venues around the city, thus tripling our ability to cover the amazing variety of events. Even with that, we had to make hard choices, and missed things we wish we hadnât. But this is the bargain we always make.</description>

During the first few minutes of The Snowman, the new adaptation of the popular thriller from Norwegian crime writer Jo NesbÃ¸, I felt as though I was in good hands. With an excellent cast â Michael Fassbender as NesbÃ¸&amp;rsquo;s alcoholic police detective Harry Hole, Charlotte Gainsbourg as his ex-girlfriend Rakel, Val Kilmer as a detective on the edge named Gert Rafto âÂ and some truly beautiful cinematography, The Snowman&amp;rsquo;s early moments felt like a perfect fall entertainment: a serial-killer flick filmed on location in Norway (one of the most beautiful countries on Earth, and I will fight you if you disagree.</description>

This week I want to talk about a book that isn&amp;rsquo;t actually a comic book, but which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist without comics. Catherynne M. Valenti&amp;rsquo;s young adult short story collection The Refrigerator Monologues is an attempt to give voice to the often-neglected women who serve in supporting roles in superhero comics.
Refrigerator is structurally a riff on the Vagina Monologues with a superhero twist, and Valenti clearly knows her source material.</description>

Here are the opening paragraphs:  This Saturday (10/21/17), Third Place Books will donate 20 percent of sales at all three of its store locations (Laker Forest Park, Ravenna, and Seward Park) to relief efforts in Puerto Rico, which has been devastated by Hurricane Maria.
Proceeds will go to Unidos Disaster Relief Fund, sponsored by the Hispanic Federation, an organization that Consumer Reports says âhas been reviewed and received high ratings from two of the watchdogs, Charity Navigator and BBB Wise Giving Alliance.</description>

      <description>**Wednesday, October 18: Translation Is a Mode**
As part of The Bagley Wright Lecture Series on Poetry, Seattle poet and translator Don Mee Choi âwill discuss Walter Benjaminâs bread, Korean cornbread, warships, Ingmar Bergmanâs The Silence, and Kim Hyesoonâs mirrors in her exploration of translation.â Translation is one of the most difficult-to-explain aspects of literature, and the experience of having a mind like Choiâs describe it for us is a blessing.</description>

In the Seattle literary scene, Lit Crawl has become that party, the one-night shindig that lays everything out in one glorious buffet. Spreading across Capitol Hill, First Hill, and downtown, Lit Crawl takes place in bars and bookstores and event spaces in five different âphasesâ on Thursday, October 19th.</description>

      <description>Lincoln in the Bardo, George Saunders&amp;rsquo;s debut novel, has won the Man Booker Prize. If you&amp;rsquo;ve already read Lincoln in the Bardo, I recommend you check out the audio book, which features an all-star cast including David Sedaris and Nick Offerman as a pair of mismatched spectral friends. I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to the book twice now, and I keep finding new things to enjoy. It&amp;rsquo;s like an old-timey radio drama about Abraham Lincoln and sacrifice and what it means to embrace your mortality.</description>

The one thing about hosting author interviews in public spaces is you&amp;rsquo;ve got to &amp;ldquo;yes, and&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; the hell out of them. No matter what the author throws at you, you have to make it an additive experience. If they tell an anecdote about fox hunting, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to find the connective tissue to tie that anecdote to the next question somehow, even if the next question is related to the stock market.</description>

      <description>âI have a boyfriend.â
The main character in Tara Atkinsonâs new novella Boyfriends says that sentence multiple times, and itâs not a statement of ownership, or an appreciation of a fact. Instead, she uses the sentence as a talisman to ward off other guys when they get creepy, when they try to make a move on her.
Itâs not enough that sheâs simply not interested in the men. She has to announce that she âbelongsâ to another man before theyâll leave her alone.</description>

met. Sheâs bringing flowers to an idea.
Of bees, thereâs a hive the child tends &amp;mdash;
fresh picked flowers on a made mound of dirt
packed in the shade of a dark green fire escape.
As she picks (and puts) I think of a singing &amp;mdash;
the voice itself a handrail up

      <description>This note was just posted on Roosevelt bar/coffee shop CafÃ© Racer&amp;rsquo;s Facebook page:
It is with great sadness that I have to say this...
CafÃ© Racer is closing.
The last night will be this Wednesday.
Lord knows the cafÃ© has had it&#39;s ups and downs but it has been 14 years of art and music and community. No one can take that away from us.
But I just can no longer support it.</description>

You&amp;#8217;ll also get a first peek at a new short film, in which local lights Laura Da&#39;, Christine Deavel, and Kathleen Flenniken join Mueller for a &amp;#8220;making of.</description>

      <description>Last week, Seattle cartoonist DW recommended a cartoonist who [posts on Instagram under the pseudonym Seattle Walk Report](https://www.instagram.com/seattlewalkreport/). Iâd never heard of her before, but when I looked her up I could easily understand why she was a favorite.
Seattle Walk Reportâs cartoons track various data points from her walks through Seattle. She might count all the pumpkins she sees, or make a running tally of newspaper boxes, or notice that every single paneled parapet on the Montlake Bridge had its own spider web inside, or write little love notes to dogs she meets while walking around town.</description>

      <description>This morning, Gardiner Harris and Steven Erlanger reported for the New York Times:
The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations cultural organization, after years of America distancing itself because of what it called the groupâs âanti-Israel bias.â The decision to leave Unesco is not really a surprise. President Trump has declared war on art, and and he&amp;rsquo;s announced his ambivalence about the rest of the world.</description>

Before Jill Lepore&amp;rsquo;s The Secret History of Wonder Woman landed on the bestseller lists, Wonder Woman&amp;rsquo;s origins were a deep nerd trivia cut. But now, pretty much everyone knows Wonder Woman was created by a disgraced professor named William Moulton Marston who was part of a triad relationship, and that with his wife he invented the lie detector. Now that it&amp;rsquo;s common knowledge, the character&amp;rsquo;s unique backstory has become a part of Wonder Woman&amp;rsquo;s appeal.</description>

      <description>In the 1990s, a ton of male cartoonists made their careers by writing stories about schlubby men with huge egos. These self-important losers âÂ from Buddy Bradley to Adrian Tomine&amp;rsquo;s protagonists to Ivan Brunetti&amp;rsquo;s self-portrayal âÂ were important at the time: they poked necessary holes in the idea that the only stories worth telling were stories about straight white men of a certain age.

**Wednesday, October 11: *Miss Koppâs Midnight Confessions* Reading**
Publishers are, understandably, hitting the heavy nonfiction titles pretty hard right now. But maybe you should take a breath and read a fun mystery series for a while? Amy Stewartâs Kopp Sisters series focuses on a woman who becomes deputy sheriff in the year 1916, and she focuses on women-centric crimes. So even while you enjoy a novel, youâll still have strong feminist women to admire.</description>

      <description>The idea of Cascadia has occasionally been held aloft by people who represent questionable causes. White supremacists love the idea of a free Caucasian Cascadia, for instance, and there are a couple of loudmouth anarchists in the Seattle area who love to bore folks at parties with their improbable vision of a utopian lawless barter economy.
But cast your eyes away from the fringes and youâll find something impressively durable in the concept of Cascadia.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend, Marvel Comics announced a partnership with arms manufacturer Northrup Grumman. The plan was to produce a comic book aimed at kids that promoted STEM education, but the fans, thankfully, weren&amp;rsquo;t having it. Here&amp;rsquo;s something delightful from a Guardian story by Joanna Walters about the blowback:
Tom Catt, a Brooklyn drag queen who declined to give his real name, was attending dressed as Cat Woman and with his friend Tony Ray, who was kitted out as the Voltron comic character Princess Allura.</description>

      <description>&amp;mdash; itâs 1962 March 28th
itâs 2017 September 19th.
Iâm sitting at the window on the 3rd floor of fog.
Day is rising.
I never knew I liked
morning lifting like a conductorâs baton.
I didnât know I loved my body.
Can someone who hates their body love it.
Iâve always schemed against my body.
Itâs just like all my other lovers.
Iâve loved long roads all my life &amp;mdash; the flat</description>

The [Seattle Antiquarian Book Fair](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/) is back as our sponsor for one last week. This weekend, October 14th and 15th, they&#39;ll fill Seattle Center&#39;s Exhibition Hall from wall to wall with books, maps, and prints â almost a hundred vendors from the United States, Canada, England, and Spain.
This is the kind of event to plan a weekend around. Start Saturday off with coffee and pastries (you&amp;rsquo;ll need sustenance) and spend the morning and afternoon exploring the Fair&amp;rsquo;s endlessly surprising stock of rarities.</description>

Denverâs Noah Van Sciver and Los Angeles cartoonist Joseph Remnant share the stage with a new-to-Seattle cartoonist who goes by the initials DW. Fantagraphics is releasing DW&#39;s very first book, a reproduction of a graph-paper sketchbook titled *Mountebank*.
DW is a serious and thoughtful young cartoonist who, in his spare time, co-founded and co-edits a comics anthology called *Irene*.</description>

âLike Sonny Listonâ: An Appreciation of Tom Petty The best thing about this piece by the Drive-By Truckers&amp;#8217; Patterson Hood is not his apt and lyrical assessment of Tom Petty&amp;#8217;s achievements as a musician, or the wry anecdotes (Petty and the Replacements trading barbs on stage, Hood napping through a one-time chance to meet his hero).</description>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1507270220519/2049.jpg)
I won&amp;rsquo;t spoil any of Blade Runner 2049 for you. Just trust me when I say you should go see it as quickly as possible, on as large a screen as possible. (I recommend going to Cinerama, obviously.) The performances are roundly incredible, but Roger Deakins&amp;rsquo;s cinematography runs away with the show. Deakins, whose photography made the generic Spielbergian thriller plot of Minority Report into a cultural touchstone, is doing the best work of his career with 2049.</description>

There is a type of romance that revels in workless wealth and luxury (see: most dukes and so many category romances set in the Greek islands). There&amp;#8217;s another kind that makes the performance of labor central to the plot and the romantic arc.</description>

      <description>Here are some words I never thought I would apply to a Noam Chomsky book: shallow, flimsy, ill-considered, dumb, and badly written.
And yet, here we are.
Requiem for the American Dream: The 10 Principles of Concentration of Wealth &amp;amp; Power, the October selection of the Reading Through It Book Club, is a bad book. Requiem is basically a transcription of a documentary by the same name âÂ Chomskyâs âfinal, long-form documentary interviews,â according to the jacket copy â and it fails on just about every conceivable level.</description>

      <description>I was 13 when I first read Frank Miller&amp;rsquo;s The Dark Knight Returns, and in retrospect I realize that it fucked me up for years. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t mentally prepared to handle Miller&amp;rsquo;s deeply conservative dystopian Batman comic, and so for a long time afterward I confused violence and nihilism for &amp;ldquo;serious art.&amp;rdquo;
So many years later, Returns reads like a clunky piece of satire by a man who was teetering on the uncomfortable razor&amp;rsquo;s edge between artistic curiosity and self-loathing regressivism.</description>

The British novelist is obviously a terrific choice for the Nobel Prize. People who like to read into the behind-the-scenes politics of prizes will likely be speculating that Ishiguro is a safe and uncontroversial choice after last year&amp;rsquo;s polarizing selection of Bob Dylan.
But no matter what the reasoning behind the award, Ishiguro is a deserving winner. I know a lot of booksellers and librarians who consider him to be their favorite novelist.</description>

      <description>As a teenager, I developed an obsession with estate sales. I partially attribute this fascination to growing up not knowing my father. I have never met anyone from his side of the family. For a long time, I felt like a half-formed thing. I often still do. I would wander through dusty basements that smelled of Pine Sol and mothballs, turning over wristwatches and ashtrays in my hands, using the mementos of strangers to construct images of the family I never knew.</description>

This morning, Seattle publisher Sasquatch Books announced that they&amp;rsquo;ve been acquired by New York publisher Penguin Random House for &amp;ldquo;an undisclosed sum.&amp;rdquo; Sasquatch and Penguin Random HouseÂ are not strangers to each other; the larger publisher has served as a distributor for Sasquatch since 2012, shipping the smaller publisher&amp;rsquo;s titles to bookstores and marketing their upcoming books to retail buyers.
Sasquatch is not moving to New York; the press will maintain their offices and staff on 3rd Avenue downtown, and they will continue to publish titles â cookbooks, guidebooks, children&amp;rsquo;s books, and so onÂ âÂ with a Northwest perspective.</description>

      <description>âThere is a Korean belief that you are born/the parent of the one you hurt most,â writes EJ Koh in her debut poetry collection A Lesser Love. . Itâs such a perfect idea that it hurts your heart just to think about it.
Thereâs a justice to the thought of being entirely responsible for the person you will wrong most in this world. They wake you every night, squalling and wordless and purely filled with rage.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re missing Obama right now, this might be the book for you. And of course, this book is a big deal because it&amp;rsquo;s the first Coates book to be published since his breakout sensation Between the World and Me.</description>

As a translator, EJ Koh told me at her book launch party at the Hugo House last month, âthere are many ways to use one word. In that sense, the words feel heavier to meâ as a translator than they do as âjustâ a poet. âThey weigh heavier on my heart and in my mind.</description>

      <description>Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles good for slow consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that&#39;s your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also look through the archives.
How to Protest Without Offending White People Michael Harriot has a brutal takedown of the response to the #takeaknee protests that just builds and builds relentlessly. An effective call for awareness (and call to arms) even for white people who supported the protests wholeheartedly.</description>

September&#39;s Theme: Another September I canât shake the feeling that September is when years end and start. The season turning into fall always makes me think of old years and time passing. This group of post-its all look back at another September, from a dramatically terrible time in my life.</description>

      <description>Holy cow: Amazon announced yesterday that they&amp;rsquo;re adapting Seattle author Neal Stephenson&amp;rsquo;s sci-fi classic Snow Crash into a TV series. And they also announced that they&amp;rsquo;re adapting Portland comics writer Greg Rucka&amp;rsquo;s comic with artist Michael Lark, the dystopian bioengineering epic Lazarus, as a series, too. And they also announced that they&amp;rsquo;re adapting Larry Niven&amp;rsquo;s Ringworld series into a TV series. I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I think Snow Crash should be a series â I don&amp;rsquo;t even know if it would be an effective movie; I think it&amp;rsquo;s better left as a novel that was ahead of its time when it was published â but the other two are ripe for serialized storytelling.</description>

**Saturday, September 30: Riot Days Reading ** Maria Alyokhina was fighting Putin years before your grandmother put on a pussy hat and started writing long Facebook rants about fighting Putin. As a member of Pussy Riot, Alyokhina spent two years in jail for her anti-Putin protests, and her memoir of her time as a Pussy Rioter will likely inspire some American women to fight a little nastier.</description>

      <description>(with apologies to Philip Larkin)
Contemporary romance peaked
In nineteen-fifty-eight
(Which of course was rather late)
When mousy Midtown office girls
Sought out rich men to date.
Now, since then there&amp;#8217;s only been
A sort of echoing
Of Heyer&amp;#8217;s style of thing;
A virgin beauty&amp;#8217;s quest to find
A duke for marrying.
For all at once, the smut appeared:
Everyone fucked the same
And every book became
A drenched and dizzy bacchanal</description>

      <description>Aside from Ms. Marvel, my favorite Marvel title these days is Nick Fury, a spy comic written by James Robinson and drawn by the acronymical comics artist ACO. Fury is unlike just about everything else Marvel is putting out these days: every issue is its own stand-alone adventure, every page is visually adventurous, and the book isn&amp;rsquo;t interested in crossovers or events.
Fury is a smart callback to the stylish Nick Fury: Agent of SHIELD book that Jim Steranko drew for Marvel during the late 1960s.</description>

      <description>Respected editor Robert Gottlieb has written 3000 words of a romance roundup for the New York Times. Let me save you some trouble and quote this bit from the end: &amp;#8220;Its readership is vast, its satisfactions apparently limitless, its profitability incontestable. And its effect? Harmless, I would imagine. Why shouldnât women dream?&amp;#8221; This is the kind of approval we women can fucking do without.

      <description>There is a language of rape. The words differ depending on whoâs speaking. There are the words used by the perpetrators. There are the words by the deniers and the words by the blamers. There are the words by the victims when they can manage to speak them. While all these words are part of the stories in M. Evelina Galangâs Lolasâ House: Filipino Women Living With War, it is the victimsâ words that Galang rightly honors, giving them the pages they deserve.</description>

I want to be clear: the idea of âreverse racismâ is bunk. Itâs made-up. Itâs not real. Same with âreverse sexism.â The reason why is pretty clear: American culture has a default switch in its cultural and political systems, and that default switch is white and male. Even now, in 2017, most popular entertainment is directed toward a white male consumer; when women and/or people of color apply for positions ordinarily filled by a white male, they must endure ridicule, scorn, and outright hatred for daring to step up.</description>

      <description>Seattle writer Charles R. Wolfeâs recent book Seeing the Better City: How to Explore, Observe, and Improve Urban Space argues that city-dwellers are more than just passive participants in the urban experience. Wolfe contends that it is everyoneâs job to investigate cities, to note changes in neighborhoods, to imagine ways that the city might be improved, to record the interaction between humans and their environment.
In order to facilitate active involvement with cities, Wolfe encourages his readers to keep what he calls âurban diaries.</description>

...Inkitt members are encouraged to post full manuscripts to be read by the appâs over a million readers. This is a way to get reader reviews and further feedback, but can also lead to a publishing deal with Inkitt itself if the reader engagement data the company collects points to a potential best-seller.
âWe analyse reader behaviour, analyse their engagement,â Inkitt founder Ali Albazaz tells me.</description>

      <description>He died on August 15, 1964,
during that hot hot summer.
Mother sent his clothes
down to Mississippi
for the Freedom Riders
or anybody else who needed them.
I wish she would have left just one item out for me,
something with his smell still on it.
One of his shirts, maybe, with the stained collar
or the worn down brown Oxfords
that he always polished.
I would have loved to have the fedora he wore all winter</description>

This week&#39;s sponsor is the fabulous [Seattle Antiquarian Book Fair](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/), an annual event in which &#34;the best bookstore in America&#34; opens for two short days, puts the wonders of the world at your fingertips, and then vanishes â leaving nothing but a trace of bookdust.
This year&amp;rsquo;s event is October 14th and 15th, at the Seattle Center&amp;rsquo;s Exhibition Hall. Just $5 gets you entry on both days, with access to more than a hundred exhibitors from the United States, Canada, England, and Spain, sharing rarities, collectibles, and ephemera.</description>

      <description>Many people have asked me what I thought about KUOW reporter Bill Radke&amp;rsquo;s response to the uproar over their interview with the Nazi. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen his comments described as &amp;ldquo;heartfelt,&amp;rdquo; and I guess that&amp;rsquo;s true. He seemed to be very emotional over the whole thing, and he acknowledged that he made some mistakes.
But as I suggested on Thursday night, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a matter of journalism. This is a bigger problem than Bill Radke.</description>

      <description>Franklin Foerâs *World Without Mind* is a must-read book of the fall season. Subtitled *The Existential Threat of Big Tech*, *World* is a full-frontal assault on the fallacious idea that the big four tech companies that shape our world âÂ Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple âÂ are benevolent firms that have the advancement of humanity in mind.
Foer smartly couches his polemic in memoir, relaying his experiences as a beloved editor of the *New Republic*.</description>

(For reasons that will hopefully be clear in a moment, I refuse to link to the interview. And for purposes of clarity, I am going to refer to the man who was interviewed as &amp;ldquo;the Nazi,&amp;rdquo; not &amp;ldquo;the man wearing the Nazi armband.</description>

Her terrific _The Long Drop_ is a beautifully-paced, novelistic slice of 1950s Glasgow, as well as an astute re-imagining of a real-life crime that riveted the city (and, to some extent, still does).</description>

I try not to give Birth Movies Death any web traffic these days due to the noxious way the site&amp;rsquo;s owner protected former BMD editor Devin Faraci in the wake of sexual assault accusations. But it&amp;rsquo;s impossible for me to separate my viewing of Kingsman: The Golden Circle from a 2015 essay on the original Kingsman film by Film Crit Hulk.
I found the first Kingsman movie to be boorish and awkward in its handling of James Bond satire, though I did appreciate the way the film addressed the inherent classism of the Bond mythos.</description>

      <description>EJ Koh read her poem âSouth Korean Ferry Accidentâ to a room full of weary Bumbershoot attendees back in 2016. Itâs a poem that begins with a bit of comedy: âFootage is released to the public: the captain/abandoning the ferry in his underwear.â Not only do we have an oafish captain forsaking the universal pledge to go down with the ship, but heâs jumping overboard in his underwear. Itâs an image that brings pratfalls to mind, or a Benny Hill-style soundtrack.</description>

      <description>Heyyyyyyy! An actually useful piece of information has been added to Google searches: now when you look up books, Google will include links to ebook listings at local libraries. Just look all the way at the bottom of the card that comes up when you Google a book title and you&amp;rsquo;ll find it there. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time Google made a change that actively improved my life with no serious setbacks, so this is a welcome development.</description>

      <description>As I drive through the bower
of old oak trees
scanning 68th and 20th avenues northeast I am scared by the moon.
It is so low in the sky this night
I think it will smack me in the face.
I try to turn the wipers on,
but strands of hair white as paste
cover the window like thick rain.
A woman&amp;rsquo;s mouth stretches open
in a silent scream. Bent fingers claw</description>

      <description>It is a towering, temporary construct in the middle of publisher Mount Analogueâs Pioneer Square gallery/storefront. It resembles a childâs blanket fort: some white sheets hanging from the ceiling, adorned with glittering strands of tinsel and crinkled-up tinfoil and spritzes of brightly colored artificial flowers. The structure is surrounded by Mount Analogueâs usual dÃ©cor â handmade books and ceramic cigarette packs and gloves with weird phrases sewn into them â and a large collection of potted plants.</description>

Sponsor [Lori Tsugawa Whaley](http://loriwhaley.com), a third-generation Japanese American, was raised in a primarily Caucasian community and felt disconnected from her Japanese heritage. While exploring this ancient culture, she discovered a source of truth â the code of ethics known as *bushido*. Bushido means âthe way of the warriorâ; it is the set of chivalrous principles that governed the behavior of the ancient Japanese warriors known as samurai.
In The Courage of a Samurai, Lori Tsugawa Whaley brings these concepts to everyday life, showing through examples the kind of ethical and moral choices you can make when guided by principles.</description>

      <description>At the end of a recent vacation, I decided to buy Hillary Clintonâs new election memoir, What Happened, at an airport bookstore. One bookstore didnât have it in stock. I went to the NBC-branded shop near my gate and at first I couldnât find a copy there, either. Finally, I found the book: it was high up on the bestseller wall, but someone had turned the display copy upside-down, in effigy.</description>

From his [*Punch to Kill* comics](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/sex-and-violence-and-the-sex-of-violence/) to his work organizing the [dearly departed *Intruder* magazine](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/07/05/barging-right-on-in/), Marc Palm is one of the most active members of Seattleâs cartooning community. So when Palm announced on Facebook earlier this summer that he broke his right arm âÂ his dominant arm, the arm that did all his drawing â the community responded with a visceral heartbreak: one of Seattleâs most prolific and enthusiastic cartoonists was going to be out of commission for the foreseeable future.</description>

The Sorrow and the Shame of the Accidental Killer A broken glass; a stumble on the sidewalk; a misplaced word that leads to hurt feelings. Most of us screw up on a daily basis, and for the most part we can fix it with a little glue and an earnest apology.</description>

      <description>Kesha had to know that her first album in five years, Rainbow, would be examined as a personal statement. This isnât a rarity in modern pop music â reviewers scour Taylor Swiftâs albums, say, for evidence of autobiographical details about her recent relationships âbut Kesha has been under increased scrutiny since the release of Warrior in 2012.
Itâs a long, sad story. In 2014, Kesha sued her producer, who works under the name Dr.</description>

      <description>On Labor Day, I argued that we need more blue-collar novelists. The thing that I didn&amp;rsquo;t note in that essay is that there are plenty of contemporary blue-collar cartoonists â not because the comics industry is so forward-thinking but because the comics industry does such a poor job of compensating artists for their work. Unless they&amp;rsquo;re a superstar name or someone who works on a number of different gigs simultaneously, the odds are good that your favorite cartoonist is either A) indepdendently wealthy or B) working multiple angles to make ends meet.</description>

*Timber Curtain* by Frances McCue
Last yearâs Ghosts of Seattle Past anthology, it turns out, was just an appetizer for this main course. Like Ghosts, Seattle poetry master McCueâs new book is a lament for the demolition of the Hugo House â an organization which she helped found. Though the House will soon return to the same spot (albeit in the ground floor of a fancy new building) McCue knows that nothing is the same once it passes through the veil of nostalgia she calls the timber curtain.</description>

Alexie was being haunted by his mother, Lillian. Alexie interpreted these repeated visits â in the form of coincidences and visions and emotional distress â as a sign. âI am supposed to stop this book tourâ¦ I am cancelling all of my events in August and I will be cancelling many, but not all, of my events for the rest of the year,â Alexie wrote.</description>

      <description>I do not recommend that writers read Joan Didionâs latest book, South and West, unless they have a very strong ego. Subtitled From a Notebook, South is a published version of Didionâs notes that she compiled during a 1970s trip to southern states. She never shaped the notes into an essay or a collection, and she undoubtedly never intended her notes to be published.
And hereâs where the potential bruised ego comes in for writers who read this book: Joan Didionâs goddamned notes are more compelling, more finely wrought, than most writersâ finished products.</description>

A poemâs content
and form are sublime
yet, narrow and broad
A poem is speechless with sound
Such is ambiguity &amp;mdash; it lives in every act
Therefore, the poem is an act &amp;mdash; an event &amp;mdash; An event is an act &amp;mdash; is a poem</description>

Aside from A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, Dave Eggersâs most influential book is probably his novel The Circle. When it was first released, the novel was derided by many in the tech sector for its unrealistic depiction of day-to-day life at a giant Google- or Facebook-like tech company. But in the years since, readers have responded viscerally to the sense of decaying privacy that pervades the book.
The Circle was never meant to be read as a tell-all roman Ã¡ clef; Eggers obviously intended it to be a cautionary tale â a modern version of 1984 or Brave New World, only set about two weeks in the future instead of several decades.</description>

Seattleâs first Readerfest &amp;mdash; a book festival brought to life in record time by Karen Junker &amp;mdash; took place Saturday at Magnuson Park, in The Brig. Iâm assuming the building actually used to be a brig. It&#39;s a building that comes together at angles, wings converging on a boxy center. The keynote took place in the Matthews Beach room, the &#34;</description>

      <description>Writing a historical romance novel involves a staggering amount of research. How corsets work, where to throw away that apple core, what kind of naughty words people would use to describe what they&amp;#8217;ve done with or to their lovers. We all do the work, but few of us do it as thoroughly as Rose Lerner, whose vivid Lively St. Lemeston books center around the people and events of one small English town.</description>

      <description>Regarding yesterday&amp;rsquo;s news that Amazon is looking to build an &amp;ldquo;equal&amp;rdquo; headquarters in some other North American city than Seattle: I was a bookseller for twelve years, first at a chain that Amazon destroyed and then at an independent bookseller. I have learned through painful experience never to trust Amazon. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s probably true that Amazon will soon be too big for Seattle alone. But if you think Amazon isn&amp;rsquo;t going to use this opportunity to pit one &amp;ldquo;headquarters&amp;rdquo; city against another in a race to the bottom, you&amp;rsquo;re mistaken.</description>

 This month&amp;#8217;s books show that in Romancelandia, enemies and villains are not precisely the same thing.
An enemy is a useful cog in any genre&amp;#8217;s story machine. Opposing goals spark conflict, lead to arguments and struggles, and the straightforward kind of who&amp;#8217;s gonna win this drama that so many books and movies and reality shows thrive on.</description>

Daniel Handler appears in conversation with Sherman Alexie tonight at Temple De Hirsch Sinai. Here&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of his new novel, All the Dirty Parts:
Let me put it this way: this is how much I think about sex. Draw a number line, with zero is, you never think about sex and ten, is it&#39;s all you think about, and while you are drawing the line, I am thinking about sex.</description>

Next week, editor J.T. Yost will debut his new comics anthology, Bottoms Up! True Tales of Hitting Rock Bottom, at the SPX alternative comics festival. In his introduction, Yost identifies the book as a labor of love, an âattempt to humanize addiction through real stories told by actual addicts.â The book features a wide array of contemporary alternative comics talent, including Seattle cartoonists Tatiana Gill and Max Clotfelter.
Addiction stories can be formulaic, in part because audiences intimately understand every rise and fall of the narrative.</description>

      <description>We had a nice big crowd at last night&amp;rsquo;s Reading Through It book club. People seemed eager to discuss Naomi Klein&amp;rsquo;s No Is Not Enough: Resisting Trump&amp;rsquo;s Shock Politics and Winning the World We Need, though the response was relatively mixed. Many readers thought Klein did an admirable job of turning around a cogent book-length analysis of the fledgling Trump administration in a matter of months. At least one book club attendee, though, was thoroughly unhappy with what he perceived to be the shoddiness of Klein&amp;rsquo;s work.</description>

**Wednesday, September 6th: Reading Through It: No Is Not Enough **
The book club thatâs jointly produced by Seattle Weekly and the Seattle Review of Books turns its attention to Naomi Kleinâs latest book, which is based on the idea that Democrats need to do more than just offer a negative. Arundhati Roy calls it âAn ordinary personâs guide to hope.â Who couldnât use more hope? Join us for this free discussion.</description>

Karen Junker is well-connected in the literary community: talk to her for five minutes and youâll realize that she knows hundreds upon hundreds of agents and editors and publishers and booksellers. Sheâs an author and an event coordinator and an editor and an unpaid publicist â someone who âlikes to introduce people that will help other people.â
Junker says one of her favorite things to do is to organize events that place a famous writer next to a lesser-known writer, creating the possibility to inexorably alter the course of a career.</description>

On the first day of August, I reported that Pioneer Square mystery bookstore Seattle Mystery Bookshop was for sale. Last night, a number of Seattle-area book journalists received an email from Seattle Mystery Bookshop owner J.B. Dickey. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve received no firm offers for the shop,&amp;rdquo; Dickey says, &amp;ldquo;so it feels as if it is time to start winding things down.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Most likely the end of the month will be it,&amp;rdquo; Dickey explains.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;a few thoughts that weren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily pertinent to today&amp;rsquo;s Lunch Date column that I still wanted to collect:
 It&amp;rsquo;s now clear that Amazon Books, the brick-and-mortar bookstore Amazon built in University Village, was the trial run for Amazon buying some national retailer like Whole Foods. They wanted to get a handle on signage and displays and all the other practical elements of physical retailing before buying into a real-world sales environment.</description>

      <description>Every dystopia needs a gimmick âÂ some hook to distinguish it from the ever-expanding constellation of literary post-apocalypses. Seattle writer Jennie Melamedâs Gather the Daughters is a dystopian novel that remixes several pre-existing gimmicks into one. Melamedâs influences are right there in a blurb on the front cover of the book, as written by Helene Wecker, who calls it âAn heir to the creations of Margaret Atwood and Shirley Jackson.â Thatâs about as succinct an observation as you can fit in a front-cover blurb.</description>

Weâve just been buzzed into Aunt Miriamâs house.
Uncle Benâs office is to the right, off the hall.
Before walking upstairs to the second floor,
I look to the right and see dark.
Mother holds my hand while I peak in:
Equipment. The kind the Nazis used?
No, for taking x-rays.
Overheard: Once, he gave me medicine
to abort my baby but it didnât work
and the baby was born with an extra thumb.</description>

Sponsor Seattle Arts &amp; Lectures stopped by just a few weeks ago to promote their 2017/2018 season, a 30th anniversary celebration packed with speakers you&#39;ll want to see. Now they&#39;re back to highlight three deftly curated special series: Sherman Alexie Loves, Women You Need to Know, and SAL&#39;s Poetry Series, which is one of the best Seattle has to offer.
We&amp;rsquo;re excited to see such impressive lineups, and especially that SAL has brought so many voices into the selection process â the Poetry Series was chosen with advice from new Civic Poet Anastacia-ReneÃ©, Billie Swift of Open Books, and Claudia Castro Luna, among others.</description>

      <title>A Labor Day proposal: Let&#39;s create more blue-collar novelists</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a well-known fact that America moved its celebration of labor from May 1st, when the rest of the world observes it, to September. The reason why is clear: government leaders were concerned that celebrating labor on May Day would encourage socialism. Because of that shift in date, Labor Day is celebrated as the early end of summer in the US. Americans barely acknowledge workers at all over Labor Day weekend â especially if weâre lucky enough to get the weekend off.</description>

      <description>Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles good for slow consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that&#39;s your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also look through the archives.
Nightingale:Â A Gloss Paisley Rekdal&amp;rsquo;s beautiful, devastating comment on her poem &amp;ldquo;Philomela&amp;rdquo; deserves a willing commitment of time and attention. Fair warning: it&amp;rsquo;s anchored by an open recounting of sexual assault, so read at your own emotional risk.</description>

      <description>The owner of a comic book store called Pristine Comics in Federal Way recently sold three collectible Wonder Woman comics for 1.5 million dollars, writes Daniel DeMay for the Seattle PI.
Public service announcement: This does not mean that the comics your mom threw away after you went to college are worth millions of dollars. Most comics do not have much, if any, resale value. Please don&amp;rsquo;t get mad at comics dealers when they tell you the stack of musty comics you brought in are only worth about five bucks.</description>

Chuck Robinson Associates will offer the leadership and advice that Robinson put to good use as the head of Village Books for decades. Village Books has repeatedly been recognized nationwide as an example of independent bookselling done right; that&amp;rsquo;s largely due to Robinson&amp;rsquo;s leadership.</description>

      <description>Even when he was getting started as a cartoonist, Sethâs comics were all about nostalgia. As a young man, his autobiographical comics depicted him as a disaffected dandy who yearned for a time before he was born â the art deco years of the 1930s. Seth spent his early middle age building a tribute to the nonexistent past that held his obsession, in the form of a timeless cardboard city called Dominion that he took on exhibition around his native Canada.</description>

      <description>**Wednesday August 30th: An Oral History of the New Orleans Ninth Ward Reading **
Twelve years ago, Hurricane Katrina destroyed a major American city while an incompetent president twiddled his thumbs. Newly Seattle-based writer Caroline Gerdesâs non-fiction history of New Orleansâs Ninth Ward recollects some of the important history that was washed away by the hurricane, including remarkable stories from the Civil Rights era.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s now apparent that John Smelcer is a literary fraud. Smelcer appears to have fabricated a Native heritage and blurbs from any number of now-deceased big-name authors. And now this 2014 story by Smelcer, a supposedly non-fiction essay about a road trip with John Updike to meet J.D. Salinger, is making the rounds online.
Knowing what we know now, the story seems obviously ridiculous. The idea of Smelcer and Updike singing &amp;ldquo;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&amp;rdquo; on their way to meet Salinger is pretty funny.</description>

Once upon a time, Bumbershoot used to draw nationally recognized authors to read to enormous audiences. Jim Carroll headlined Bumbershoot in 2000, and a slate of young *McSweeney*âs authors followed a few years after that. Allie Brosh and Harvey Pekar both read to packed houses. Touring groups of writers like Sister Spit were showcased. Terry McMillan read the same year that UB40 played. Hell, Larry McMurtry was a big-name headliner in 1977.</description>

Ten days ago, I was in Oceanside, CA for the [North San Diego Latino Book and Family Festival](http://lbff.us/home/north-san-diego-county-festival/). I took part in a fiction panel and also spent several hours at the author&#39;s booth, copies of [_Hola and Goodbye_](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/i-like-to-be-in-america/) in front of me. Iâm a terrible salesperson, but I managed to sell a few, and I thrilled at putting my book about a Mexican-American family into the hands of other Latinos.</description>

This week&#39;s sponsor, Linda Joy Myers, joins us with a chapter from her recently published memoir, *Song of the Plains* â a tale as vast as the Great Plains on which it&#39;s set, spanning the lives of three generations of Oklahoma women: grandmother, mother, daughter. It&#39;s a tale of history, family, and transformation, of &#34;secret stories&#34; brought into the great wide open through forty years of painstaking research.
And Linda Joy Myers knows memoir: she&amp;rsquo;s president of the National Association of Memoir Writers, a memoir coach and teacher, and the author of multiple books on the craft.</description>

      <description>Our August Poet in Residence, [Daemond Arrindell](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/daemond-arrindell/), is having a fantastic year. He co-authored the world premiere of a theatrical adaptation of T. Geronimo Johnsonâs novel *Welcome to Braggsville* at Book-It Repertory Theatre earlier this year to universal acclaim. And he was [recently announced as the curator of the 2018 Jack Straw Writers program](http://www.jackstraw.org/programs/asp/2018_apps.shtml), which means heâll select and guide a class of Seattle writers through the process of learning how to perform their writing more effectively.</description>

I failed to mention in this week&amp;rsquo;s reading calendar that the Seattle Anarchist Book Fair is tomorrow, August 26th, from 10 am to 5 pm at the Vera Project in Seattle Center. It features all kinds of neat organizations including Books to Prisoners, Left Bank Books, and the Social Justice Film Festival, and it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely free. Go check it out, please.
 You should definitely read this Seattle Times story about how Seattle is now the country&amp;rsquo;s biggest company town:</description>

      <description>My favorite writing podcast isnât about poetry or novels or non-fiction. Itâs about screenwriting. John August and Craig Mazinâs Scriptnotes is a long-running podcast that takes listener questions, offers industry interviews, and occasionally pulls screenplays apart to see how they work. While Mazin and August are sometimes a little too conventional in their advice âÂ the film industry does love a formula â theyâre great hosts who cheerfully provide useful information, and theyâre terrific in the way they treat writing as a craft and not divine inspiration.</description>

      <description>In March of 1979, Amitav Ghosh witnessed a bizarre storm in Delhi, India. The sky darkened, unseasonable rain squalls turned to hail, and a funnel-shaped whirlwind appeared. Ghosh ran for cover. He emerged to find buses overturned, scooters wedged in trees, and walls torn from buildings. The lethal event, which killed at least 30 people, was so rare that newspapers didnât correctly identify it for two days â a tornado, the first in the regionâs recorded history.</description>

J.L. Cheatham II took his four-year-old daughter to the Tukwila Barnes &amp;amp; Noble to find her a book about her newest obsession âÂ dinosaurs. Once they got to the kidsâ section, he started looking around, and he noticed something: There were plenty of books about dinosaurs, but on âall the covers of the childrenâs books,â Cheatham tells me, âthere were no black or brown faces.â He decided right then and there to write his daughter a dinosaur book that starred kids who look like her.</description>

      <description>Weâve all got those notebook pages crammed full of bad poetry skulking somewhere around in our pasts, donât we? I know I tried to communicate the wretched angst and hormonal discomfort of my teen years in poetry. I filled page after page of three-hole-punched notebook paper with awful, unrhymed poems, in a desperate attempt to communicate the hell of my perfectly safe and privileged adolescence to the world. Thankfully, I destroyed all those papers many years ago, but sometimes I can still summon a line to mind, and it invariably makes me cringe.</description>

The Friends of The Seattle Public Library is searching for a 9,000 square foot facility to process material for its annual book sales. The current lease at the Washington Talking Book &amp; Braille Library in South Lake Union ends in late 2018. For the past 46 years, the Friends book sales have provided inexpensive used books to raise money for The Seattle Public Library.</description>

&amp;mdash; Michael M. Grynbaum (@grynbaum) August 22, 2017 We are rapidly hurtling into a time in which young writers will reflect with awe on the fact that there were thousands of free alternative newsweeklies from coast to coast that employed writers â many on a full-time basis â to write about the life of the city.</description>

      <description>Last night I became a flock of birds on the eve of their descent.
Last night I was a murder of crows.
To be a murder of crows is to not know
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;if you are magic&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;or dreaming,
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a flask of ring tones&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;or a canvas of teachers

I did not know body or the hungering scratch for permission.
I was at once a marriage of galaxies, a shining glory of mistakes,</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re immensely grateful to this week&amp;rsquo;s sponsor, Howard Robertson, for sharing an excerpt from his recent novel Love in the Cretaceous â which turns everything you learned from Jurassic Park on its head. In Robertson&amp;rsquo;s Oregon, one hundred years from now, dinosaurs roam the earth, while humans are busy cutting off their own exit. Robertson, a notable local poet and fiction writer, throws his readers into the soup with love, loss, and extinction (and a very sinister cameo); the thrills in this one are metaphysical as well as primordial, as you&amp;rsquo;ll see when you dip in.</description>

      <description>Now that former White House senior advisor Steve Bannon is back in charge of hyperconservative news outlet Breitbart, it&amp;rsquo;s vitally important to note that Amazon is one of the last remaining mainstream advertisers on Breitbart.
.@amazon Please stop advertising on Breitbart

      <description>Annie Dillard&#39;s Classic Essay: &#39;Total Eclipse&#39; Instead of starting this week&amp;rsquo;s picks looking backward at the barfing horror show of a week that proceeded it, let us turn our attention to the heavens, to the cleaving of our nation by a shadow stripe which will wend its way from west to east, a direction opposite the sun&amp;rsquo;s travel (therefore significant, symbolically), and in that unearthly darkness (the shadow of which, for a minute or three, reminds us of one necessary constant in our lives that we barely pay enough heed to, the mostly unhidden sun) may the sins of our forbearers be purified in the birth of a new sun, a post eclipse sun, a sun whose rays pierce madness and bring succor to pain and horror and fear.</description>

      <description>Some smartass on Twitter pointed out that the Trump presidency is the first one where the American people, and not the president, will age twenty years over a single term of office. Time is flowing in an incredibly weird way these days. Days sometimes feel like minutes, but weeks feel like months. And months feel like decades.
So I want you to cast your memory waaaaaaaaaayyyyyy back to the distant past of February 2017.</description>

Are you still baffled by the way the earth revolves
Around the sun and not the other way around?
Are you terrified by the ever-shifting ground?
  Corinne Manning has a new story over at Joyland this week, and it&amp;rsquo;s weird and beautiful and full of greatness:  How does a wallaby play into this?</description>

      <title>Thursday Comics Hangover: Same shit, different costume</title>

Most modern superhero comics feel like action figure catalogs. Every story involves a new costume, or an alternate-reality version of a character, or a new character taking over the title temporarily. It just feels like the creators are stewards of an IP, adding value to the original concept by spinning a variant into existence that will one day be molded into plastic and sold.
The first issue of artist Greg Capullo and writer Scott Snyder&amp;rsquo;s DC crossover comic Dark Nights: Metal is basically everything modern audiences want in superhero comics: wall-to-wall action, decorated with a bunch of Easter eggs that call back to decades of convoluted continuity.</description>

Matthew Zapruder isnât a Seattle poet, but he edits for Seattle-based Wave Books and he publishes with Port Townsend-based Copper Canyon Press. His newest book is a self-described âimpassioned call for a return to reading poetryâ titled *Why Poetry*. While generally demands that people should read poetry are like telling kids to eat broccoli, Zapruder is a brainy and passionate advocate. * Sorrento Hotel, 900 Madison St.</description>

Sierra Nelson loves cephalopods. Squids, octopuses, cuttlefishÂ âÂ you name it, if itâs a bilateral mollusk with a big-ass head, Nelson is positively gaga over it. Nelson is a Seattle-area poet, and you can understand how a poet might fall in love with betentacled sea creatures: theyâre romantic figures, skulking in the ocean â a part of the great marine biosphere, but also remote from the whales and fish. Those articulate limbs and big brains set them apart from the rest, leaving them to skulk and mope fabulously.</description>

      <description>When I called my Dad to tell him I had less than $100 in my bank account, he was understandably frustrated. Here he was subsidizing his sonâs second internship in Washington DC â an unpaid one at that. He never had to intern in the 1980s. He spent his summers working in the back of kitchens, graduated from college and then got a middle-class job. He most likely anticipated that I would follow a similar order.</description>

      <description>Nazism is on the rise in America, even though the generation that fought Nazis is still alive. I canât be the only person whoâs wondered if humanity is destined to repeat this resurgence of racists and white nationalists every 60 to 80 years, when the memory of the last battle has grown sufficiently dim.
Nazism is a virus. It passes from one infected person to another. The Charlottesville rally on Saturday was especially dangerous because the white supremacists didnât wear masks; they very likely activated hundreds of other white supremacists who have to date been too ashamed to speak out in public about their own racist views.</description>

      <description>After Natasha Marinâs Red Lineage
my name stumbles ups the stairs
climbing towards grace, an ascending arc of red and gold
my mother&amp;rsquo;s name mends shards back to glass
melts them down with the heat of a thousand hearts,
an aged and forgiving red
my father&amp;rsquo;s name lives in a spoonful of shadows
hungering for a cloud that will rain red
follow the seedlings and you will see
my name become a little kite dancing in the wind,</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve all dreamed about making the big leap: a new job, a new country, a new life. Molly McCord did all three, leaving a stable but unsatisfying career in Seattle to start over in Paris, a city she&amp;rsquo;d never seen. She shares the story in The Art of Trapeze â part memoir, part instruction manual for choosing a different path. As the title implies, trusting yourself as your feet leave the platform is the hardest and most necessary part.</description>

      <description>Just in case you weren&amp;rsquo;t sure that convicted felon and self-described &amp;ldquo;disgraced&amp;rdquo; conservative attack dog Dinesh D&amp;rsquo;Souza is a horrible person, look no further than his tweet from Sunday:
This argument is more relevant than ever as the media left tries to use #Charlottesville to promote its Big Lies about fascism &amp;amp; Nazism pic.twitter.com/58uAfB2Tn0
&amp;mdash; Dinesh D&amp;#39;Souza (@DineshDSouza) August 13, 2017 Rather than be embarrassed about the subject matter of his new book, which tries to tie liberals to Nazism, D&amp;rsquo;Souza is trying to profit off of the Charlottesville neo-Nazi rally.</description>

      <title>Talking with Steve Toutonghi about all the work a book cover has to do</title>

Next May, Seattle author Steve Toutonghi is publishing his second novel, *Side Life*, with Soho Press. Today, Toutonghi and Soho are exclusively sharing the book&#39;s cover with *Seattle Review of Books* readers. (That&#39;s it right up above this paragraph.) The novel â about a discouraged internet entrepreneur who takes a demeaning job as a housesitter in a billionaire&#39;s tech-haunted mansion â has to convey a lot of information in its cover: it has to look futuristic but not too distant, it has to convey the sense that it&#39;s a thriller, and it has to stand out from all the rest of the books that will be coming out next year.</description>

&#34;Ready Player One&#34; is a terrible book and it will be a terrible movie There&amp;#8217;s nothing like a solid takedown, especially of a book that, apparently, many people disliked but were afraid to confess to disliking until the movie trailer came out.</description>

      <description>You may recall that Ivan Schneider &amp;mdash; frequent contributor and friend of the Seattle Review of Books &amp;mdash; in his interview with David Shields, talked about his delicious outsider theory on how Cervantes intended Don Quixote to have a talking dog character.
Schneider turned that theory into an academic paper titled &amp;ldquo;The Search for Dog in Cervantes&amp;rdquo;, which was just published in the peer-reviewed Humanties journal, in their special &amp;ldquo;Animal Narratology&amp;rdquo; issue.</description>

&amp;ldquo;When it comes to my family,&amp;rdquo; Jeannette Walls scolds her fiancee early in The Glass Castle, &amp;ldquo;let me do the lying, okay?&amp;rdquo; In this part of the film, Walls is portrayed by Brie Larsen as a steely gossip columnist, and the line is delivered with a forcefulness that makes it clear she&amp;rsquo;s not kidding. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting line to begin the film with, because Castle is based on Walls&amp;rsquo;s memoir of the same name, and it&amp;rsquo;s one of those memoirs that feels too sensationalistic to be true.</description>

Conflict vs. tension Something&amp;rsquo;s got to happen. Who wants to read about happy characters dwelling contentedly in the land of status quo with no worries, no desires, no agendas? Paying customers prefer action. We authors love our characters (who are often facets of our own selves), but in pursuit of stories others will read we torture and provoke them, prod them, plumb their depths.</description>

      <description>August 2017 marks the fourth year running for [Women in Translation Month](https://womenintranslation.com). The project was launched in 2014 by [Meytal Radzinski](https://literarytranslators.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/women-in-translation-an-interview-witth-meytal-radzinski/), a scholar and passionate reader of non-English literature, to encourage discussion about the incredible disparity in publication of translated works by women vs. men. The skew line is, painfully but not surprisingly, even steeper than for published writing overall.
It&#39;s an urgent issue, enough to keep the WIT project expanding to an ever-broader group of participants around the world â writers, translators, readers, critics âÂ and to drive the inauguration of the new [Warwick Prize for Women in Translation](http://www2.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve gotta love a comics anthology built on a theme. There&amp;rsquo;s something so conversational and warm and inquisitive about collections of short comics, particularly when they&amp;rsquo;re all examining a particular idea from a wide variety of perspectives.

      <description>Authors love to write haunted house novels because theyâre all symbolism, and symbolism is fun to write. Why labor over a Cheeveresque, subtle examination of a typically unhappy suburban family when you can just have blood literally pouring from the walls of their home? The haunted house story combines Americaâs top three love affairs â real estate, dysfunctional families, and karmic retribution â into one sloppy orgy.
But the problem with haunted house stories is that theyâve been done so often that itâs almost impossible to add something new to the form.</description>

Iâve lost count of the number of times Iâve seen Storme Webber read at Seattle literary events. In person, she is an explosion: her poetry is a performance with real drama to it, and the prose is meticulously crafted, as though carved into stone. If you just scanned literary calendar listings, you could make the mistake of believing Webber to be just another poet, endlessly anthologized in group readings around town.</description>

      <description>Almost exactly four years ago, I reviewed Seattle author Richard Chiemâs short story collection You Private Person. I request that you donât look up the review. Itâs not bad, exactly, but I clearly didnât understand the book very well. I blabbed for a while, failed to find a point, and then concluded the review having said exactly nothing. (Pro tip: when a reviewer opens a piece raving about the beauty of an authorâs sentences, that reviewer is probably pushing up against a deadline and canât figure out what else to say.</description>

This week&#39;s glimpse between the covers of an upcoming book is courtesy of sponsor and local author Elizabeth C. Fowler. Fowler grew up in Australia as a Hungarian refugee, then immigrated to Seattle with her family, facing the challenge of discrimination on one continent and integration on the other. How she got from there to here âÂ and grew from a lonely young girl into a talented physician with a passionate love for music and nature âÂ is a story worth reading.</description>

This morning, [we interviewed J.L. Cheatham II about how he decided to be an author](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/08/07/all-the-covers-of-the-childrens-books-there-were-no-black-or-brown-faces-a-conversation-with-jl-cheatham-ii/). The second half of this interview covers how he decided to launch the Seattle Urban Book Expo, and explains what people can expect from the second [Seattle Urban Book Expo](https://www.facebook.com/events/273318933131844/), which takes place on August 26th at Washington Hall.
**So you just decided to throw a book expo without having any idea how to do that kind of thing.</description>

      <description>Almost half a year ago, we told you that Hugo House was preparing to donate the 30,000 or so zines that made up the core library of the Zine Archive and Publishing Project (ZAPP) to the Seattle Public Library (SPL). I also interviewed ZAPP staff about their issues with the move.
There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of silence over the last few months, but now it&amp;rsquo;s official: in a press release dated August 2nd, SPL announced that the collection has officially changed hands and they&amp;rsquo;re now in possession of the ZAPP collection.</description>

On August 26th at Washington Hall, author [J.L. Cheatham II](http://jaytheauthor.com) will host his second [Seattle Urban Book Expo](https://www.facebook.com/events/273318933131844/) âÂ a big party to promote Seattle&#39;s many authors of color. I sat down with Cheatham last week to talk about how he became a writer and what inspired him to start the Seattle Urban Book Expo. We&#39;ve divided this interview into two halves: this first part covers how Cheatham came to be an author, and [the second half deals directly with the Book Expo](http://www.</description>

      <description>Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles good for slow consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that&#39;s your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also look through the archives.
Beat the Clock This essay by soccer player Georgia Cloepfill starts with what I believe is called a &amp;#8220;devastating indictment&amp;#8221; of the discrepancy in how male and female athletes are treated, financially and otherwise; that section alone is worth your time.</description>

      <description>A post shared by The Seattle Review of Books (@seattlereviewof) on Aug 3, 2017 at 6:26pm PDT
 
Last night, a fantastic new kind of bookstore announced itself. X Y Z Gallery, located at 3rd and Washington in Pioneer Square, is a collaboration between art gallery Specialist and local publishers Mount Analogue, Gramma Poetry, and Cold Cube Press. (You can read more about them here.) It was a young, fashionable, and appropriately arty affair, with lots of costumes and glitter and fabulousness.</description>

      <description>Aside from Charles Schulz&amp;rsquo;s Peanuts, American comics aren&amp;rsquo;t great at melancholy. I&amp;rsquo;ve read plenty of depressing comics, and many upbeat comics, but the gentle downward slope of melancholy seems too subtle for most American cartoonists to capture.

      <description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk about Matthew Desmond&amp;rsquo;s book Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City during last night&amp;rsquo;s edition of the Reading Through It book club at Third Place Books Seward Park. Every time I tried to talk, I fumbled over my words, or said something that meant the exact opposite of what I was trying to say. This happens a fair amount when it comes time to talk about housing.</description>

Colleen Louise Barry, the publisher at Seattle small press Mount Analogue, told me back in April that she dreamed of opening up a space somewhere in the city, a venue as nontraditional and artistic as the titles Mount Analogue publishes. She was reticent to discuss the idea âÂ it seemed too crazy, in a city with booming real estate prices, to imagine â but eventually I coaxed it out of her.</description>

Seattle Mystery Bookshop, the mystery-centric bookstore that has held down a storefront on Cherry Street in Pioneer Square for decades, is for sale as of today. You may recall that Seattle Mystery Bookshop ran a GoFundMe in January of last year. In a note on the store&amp;rsquo;s blog, owner J.B. Dickey says that successful fundraiser &amp;ldquo;bought us a year â but barely, and that has taken its toll.&amp;rdquo; He says another fundraiser would continue an unsustainable business model.</description>

Independent booksellers and librarians made Jeannette Walls&amp;rsquo;s 2005 coming-of-age memoir The Glass Castle into a global bestseller. While Castle was obviously well-written and funny and heartbreaking, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine the book breaking through into the mainstream without the passionate support of librarians and booksellers who understood the value of a meaningful coming-of-age story.
The film adaptation of Glass Castle (starring Brie Larson, Woody Harrelson, and Naomi Watts) is coming out on Friday, August 11th, and because the literary community made the book such a huge success, the good folks at film PR firm Allied Integrated Marketing wanted to make sure that bookish folks got to see it first.</description>

      <description>Great news! Seattle&amp;rsquo;s next Civic Poet will be Anastacia-RenÃ©e, who until recently was the poet-in-residence at the Hugo House. Appropriately, I just wrote about Anastacia-Renee&amp;rsquo;s ubiquitousness a couple weeks ago, and I wrote about the importance of the Civic Poet program last week. It&amp;rsquo;s like it was meant to be.
From the city&amp;rsquo;s announcement:
âWhen poetry takes center stage, tension filled spaces become safe literary hubs where community members can gather to share and celebrate the plethora of local, historical, and contemporary voices,â says Anastacia-ReneÃ©.</description>

If you frequent the San Juan Islands, you&#39;ve likely seen Tom Small&#39;s sculptures â shaped in stone, but the opposite of ponderous. This Thursday, sponsor Arundel Books is celebrating the launch of a new book celebrating Small&#39;s work, on their Chatwin imprint, and you&#39;re invited to attend.
The book&amp;rsquo;s focus is expansive, gracious images highlighting the sculptor&amp;rsquo;s work and process; the launch party doubles as the opening for a new exhibition, so it should be a truly immersive experience.</description>

      <description>Over at The Smart Set, Paula Marantz Cohen wrote a terrific piece about how one negative book review â written by Norman Mailer â changed the course of a friendship and a career.
If the personal is political, as the â60s activists used to say, the political is, even more, inherently personal. When a smart, highly sensitive man like [Norman] Podhoretz is dramatically misread by most everyone he respects, when his dearest friend makes a laughing stock of him in print, is it surprising that he would be driven to separate himself socially and politically from everything such people stand for?</description>

Not only was her poem a note-perfect benediction for the site â it could be read as a meditation about the distance between storytellers and audience âÂ but Agodon is such a significant figure in the Seattle-area poetry scene that her poem provided the site with instant credibility.</description>

 A gleeful moment catching a fictional private investigator in the act of comfort-reading an Elmore Leonard novel had me rushing off to re-visit this fun guide to writing. From &amp;ldquo;Never open a book with weather,&amp;rdquo; all the way to &amp;ldquo;Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip,&amp;rdquo; and with a loving nod to the power of hooptedoodle, Leonardâs teasing, detailed advice is pure pleasure.</description>

      <description>Today the _Seattle Review of Books_ celebrates its second birthday âÂ two years of publishing original writing about books with a uniquely Seattle flavor. To honor the anniversary, the siteâs co-founders met up in their favorite habitat, a Slack channel, for a wide-ranging conversation about the city, its writers and readers, and the future of book reviewing.
If you havenât had the pleasure of joining a conversation with [Paul Constant](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/paul-constant/) and [Martin McClellan](http://www.</description>

      <title>The Kakutani era of book reviewing at the New York Times has ended</title>

      <description>Joe Pompeo at Vanity Fair:
*Vanity Fair* has learned that Michiko Kakutani, The *New York Times* chief book reviewer and Pulitzer Prize winner, who has been, by a wide margin, the most powerful book critic in the English-speaking world, is stepping down. Her final review, on the debut novel by Nigerian author Ayobami Adebayo, was published on Tuesday. I&amp;rsquo;ll likely have more thoughts on this at a later date, but here&amp;rsquo;s my first impression: even people who don&amp;rsquo;t typically read book reviews in the New York Times â here, I raise my hand meekly â have to acknowledge that this is a big deal for American literature.</description>

      <title>Thursday Comics Hangover: Coates check</title>

      <description>I have to admit something: I loved the first issue of Ta-Nehisi Coates&amp;rsquo;s Black Panther, but the series has largely lost my interest in the intervening year-and-a-half. That first issue was a perfect balance between pop-culture philosphy and superhero action, and Coates seemed to be attempting a more stylish version of a text-heavy style of comics writing that we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in mainstream comics since the 1980s.
But gradually, over the next few issues, Coates&amp;rsquo;s writing went from wordy to overindulgent to bloated.</description>

      <description>Long ago, the Ada&amp;rsquo;s Technical Books space on 15th Ave used to be a used bookstore called Horizon Books. In 2009, Horizon moved to an underground space on 10th Avenue between Pike and Pine. And now, this message from Horizon bookseller Don Glover started circulating on social media:
Fellow booksellers, friends, and long time customers, It&#39;s come that time, to finally close the shutters, and hinge the doors of Horizon Books, but it&#39;s been a grand run these past 47 years.</description>

      <description>Beloved Seattle-area poet Crysta Casey passed away in 2008, but her work is very much alive. Casey wrote poems about herself and her self: she wrote openly and with great energy about her schizophrenia, and her cancer journey. Her work was vital and personal and incredibly strong â thereâs probably no greater indicator of the power of Caseyâs writing than the fact that her dearest friends are still safeguarding and expanding her legacy.</description>

      <description>Every so often some jackass from a conservative outlet will point to government expenditure on poets as a sign that spending is out of control. Two years ago, for example, KIRO ran a story headlined âCity will pay poet $10K to hold performances, workshopsâ that seemed to be designed to whip commenters into an uproar. In terms of state and city budgets, the numbers weâre talking about arenât even big enough to count as pocket change: the Washington state Poet Laureate position receives a $20,000 annual stipend from the state (though mostly that money comes from grants and not taxes) and Seattleâs Civic Poet earns that aforementioned $10,000 for a two-year stint.</description>

      <description>The host of the computer science book club at Ada&amp;rsquo;s Technical Books has written a great Medium post about why you should start (or join) a computer science book club.
 In what may be one of the greatest instances of architectural trollery in history, someone built a Parthenon out of banned books on the site where Nazis burned books in 1933.
 This person thinks e-books are on the way to being a &amp;ldquo;dead format.</description>

      <description>This week marks the anniversary of our first publication, two years ago. Can you believe it?
How lucky are we, being able to publish local original content, day after day. Publish nearly two hundred reviews, a huge parcel of poems, and enough daily columns to keep even the most fidgety Seattle reader eye-deep in words. We&amp;rsquo;ve had some triumphs, and some stumbles, but through it all one thing has remained constant: you.</description>

      <description>Karen Junkerâs life has always been devoted to books. Though the tiny Washington town where she grew up, DuPont, didnât have a library when she was young, âI loved reading more than anything.â One of her high school classmates was Robert Heinleinâs niece, and Junker clearly recalls her meeting with the sci-fi great to be a turning point in her life.
âSome people collect comics and baseball cards, and I collect meetings with famous authors,â Junker tells me on the phone, just before relaying an anecdote about accidentally bumping into George R.</description>

From 1994 to 2004, Northwest Bookfest was a centerpiece of Seattleâs literary year. Held in various locations throughout the city â from a pier on the waterfront to Washington State Convention Center to Magnuson Park â the general-interest literary festival brought as many as 20,000 Seattleites together over a weekend to meet a wide array of nationally published authors.
Northwest Bookfest eventually failed for a number of reasons, but ultimately those reasons all boiled down to money: Seattleites balked at a cover charge, sponsors including the Seattle Times backed out, publishers stopped sending as many authors on nationwide tours.</description>

Go Independent Or Go Home Not to beat you with a dead horse, as my high school chemistry teacher used to say (verbatim) â the issues novelist Matthew Galloway raises in this piece are frequently discussed on the Seattle Review of Books âÂ but: Publishing is going through the kind of cataclysmic shift that certain industries refer to as &amp;#8220;disruptive,&amp;#8221; and no reader or writer can afford to play innocent bystander.</description>

      <description>For weeks now, friends have been telling me to read 17776, a longform experimental sci-fi story written and designed by Jon Bois. I was resistant because the story is, in general terms, about football. That is to say that it begins as a blog post titled &amp;ldquo;What football will look like in the future.&amp;rdquo; And I cannot stand sports at all.
But just a quick glance at the beginning of 17776 will tell you that it&amp;rsquo;s not really about sports.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I reported that The Stranger is running a &amp;ldquo;contest&amp;rdquo; to choose a writer to serve as the Bumbershoot Correspondent for their Bumbershoot guide and website. Though the writer will win a collection of branded merchandise from contest partners, including a camera, film, and records, the position is unpaid. Just last week, Stranger publisher Tim Keck posted that the publication is &amp;ldquo;profitable&amp;rdquo; and has &amp;ldquo;been growing financially for years.&amp;rdquo; If that&amp;rsquo;s true, why isn&amp;rsquo;t The Stranger paying a writer for their work?</description>

According to Metro Parks spokesman Michael Thompson, 173 submissions were received over the weekend â and some variation of a name honoring Herbert was âthe most common.â (There was at least one vote each for Parky McParkface and Breaky McWaterface.</description>

      <description>A considerable portion of Seattleâs comic book talent is in San Diego this week at the corporate pop cultural orgy known as San Diego Comic Con. It makes sense to take stock of comic culture at this time of year, because itâs the closest thing to a High Holy Days in the nerd calendar year. Look anywhere on the internet right now and youâll probably find an equal share of breathless odes to SDCC and vicious takedowns of everything having to do with the crass commercialism of nerd culture.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that the deadline to apply for a table at this year&amp;rsquo;s Short Run Comix &amp;amp; Arts Festival is July 31st. The organizers this year are eager to include the literary arts, so even if you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; a writer and not an artist or cartoonist, you should consider applying.
 This is a pretty big get: the King County Library System Foundation announced yesterday that basketball great and all-around awesome human Kareem Abdul-Jabbar will be the headliner at their 2018 Literary Lions fundraising dinner.</description>

      <description>Every so often in Seattle, a writer pops into the popular consciousness. Youâll find them everywhere at once: in every Seattle-centric magazine, newspaper, and website that covers the literary scene. (Yes, and there arenât so many of those these days, but thatâs a complaint for another time.)
When these kinds of writers appear â a Robert Lashley, say, or a Sarah Galvin, to use two recent-ish examples â it must be easy for aspiring authors to fall prey to jealousy.</description>

      <description>Ever since Douglas Adamsâs Hitchhikerâs Guide to the Galaxy first wooed me into reading adult fiction, Iâve always had a soft spot for the mixture of sci-fi and comedy. So the none-too-serious title of Becky Chambersâs first novel, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, caught my attention from the shelves at University Book Store. And the cover blurb by Ancillary Justice author Ann LeckieÂ âÂ it just reads âGreat fun!</description>

      <description>There is a part of me that doesnât understand longing.
And yet, with my hands full of daisies, forget-me-nots,
I walk into a field of wildflowers and ask for more.
This is how I feel when you touch my shoulder.
There are nights of only so much moonshine
and I want to bathe in more than my share.
Saltwater, youâve said. The oceans calms. Sometimes
I lose myself and want to go under.</description>

Seattle is alive with great readings and lectures, and this week&#39;s sponsor is a standout. Each year Seattle Arts &amp; Lectures presents one of the most carefully curated programs in the city, bringing in big-name speakers and showcasing up-and-comers across a wide range of genres and themes. It&#39;s the kind of mix only a long-running series with a loyal audience can pull off.
SAL is celebrating three decades â no small achievement for an arts organization, even in a city like this one â and their 2017&amp;#8211;2018 season lineup reflects that spirit of celebration.</description>

The last few times Iâve gone into Barnes &amp;amp; Noble stores, Iâve come away depressed. The shelves are sparse more often than not, and the lack of customers means the store is overcome with an eerie silence. The only thing more depressing than an empty bookstore is an empty chain bookstore, with its weirdly atonal corporate signage and full bins of untouched fidget spinners.</description>

      <title>No pastors or pews: talking with Anastacia-ReneÃ©</title>

      <description>Anastacia-ReneÃ© is a poet who knows how to read her work â she takes control of an audience by refusing to conform to standardized modes of delivery. She reads about eating pussy in a roomful of straight people and indicts structural racism in white-dominated spaces. She throws her voice out into the room, but also pulls you in with a whisper or an aside. There is a fusion to her performance style that has obviously taken years to perfect â a commingling of spoken word, black radical oration, theatrical exposition, intergenerational storytelling, queer gossip, and academic training.</description>

Real Men Might Get Made Fun Of Lindy West isn&amp;#8217;t a social justice warrior, she&amp;#8217;s a social justice apocalypse. Unsurprisingly, she&amp;#8217;s already taking heat for her new weekly column in the New York Times â the Internet&amp;#8217;s creepiest denizens have very little sense of irony.</description>

Sherman Alexie just posted an open letter to his Facebook page announcing the cancellation of most of the upcoming speaking engagements for his new memoir, You Don&amp;rsquo;t Have to Say You Love Me.
Love is a memoir about a tumultuous year in Alexie&amp;rsquo;s life â one in which his mother passed away and Alexie underwent brain surgery to remove a benign tumor. The book was published on a fairly fast schedule, which means Alexie was still deep in the process of grieving and recovering from the events described in the book.</description>

Volume two of FranÃ§oise Mouly and Nadja Spiegelmanâs comics anthology Resist! Grab Back! was sitting in the free stacks at Phoenix Comics last night. Even though it says âFREEâ in big block letters on the front of the book, it still felt a little like shoplifting to walk off with it: itâs a 48-page full color anthology of anti-Trump comics by cartoonists from around the world.

      <description>The Seattle-area cartoonist behind Grab Back Comics, an industrious woman using the pseudonym âErma Blood,â says that her site was born in those early, helpless days just after the 2016 presidential election. Blood took her wife on a vacation to celebrate their first wedding anniversary âand it was very sweet,â she says. âBut my experience of the coverage of sexual assaults and harassment during the election had really taken a toll.</description>

      <description>My friend on the couch trembles.
Sheâs crying because someone in her family
has died/is dying/is dead. She has stopped
speaking in future tense and only says, Now.
The clock speaks in abstract sentences
and she says, We need more wine.
A corner of her life is being rebuilt
by a construction company she hasnât approved.
A corner and her driveway is being paved.
With gravestones. When she cries, I pour her</description>

      <description>Mara Siegler at Page Six writes that professional troll and amateur hate-monger Milo Yiannopoulos is suing Simon &amp;amp; Schuster for ten million dollars. The publisher canceled Yiannopoulos&amp;rsquo;s book after some of his pro-pedophilia comments came to light. Siegler writes:
In the suit filed with the New York County clerk, Yiannopoulos claims the publisher caused âirreparable harmâ to him and âthe commercial value of his public persona, including millions of dollars in royalties and fees, as well as permanent harm to the development and exploitation of his stature as an important, sought after media figure and free speech personality.</description>

I talked with Dawn about what kind of pitches she&#39;s looking for, why she&#39;s interested in working with the *Seattle Review of Books*, and what she likes to see in reviews.</description>

âLove Thy Neighbor?â Dawson, MN, welcomed Dr. Ayaz Virji â its first Muslim resident â with open arms when he and his family arrived three years ago. Then his town joined the majority in Minnesota that voted to put Donald Trump into office.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve written several times about how much we love the children&amp;rsquo;s books of Seattle author Jessixa Bagley. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to hear Bagley discuss her life and work, she guest-starred on the All the Wonders podcast earlier this week. Make sure to check it out.
 You probably know that Fantagraphics cartoonist Matt Furie&amp;rsquo;s cartoon character Pepe the Frog has become a symbol of the Trump-loving alt-right. Furie is by all accounts a wonderful, easygoing guy who was completely blindsided by the fact that his laid-back cartoon frog has become the rough equivalent of a swastika.</description>

      <description>When it comes to Spider-Man, you&amp;rsquo;re either a fan of the Ditko take on the character, or you prefer John Romita. Ditko, of course, created Spider-Man â with some assistance from Stan Lee â but Romita took over the series from Ditko and codified it into the Spider-Man we know today.
It breaks down like this: Ditko&amp;rsquo;s art is weird and a little off-putting and gorgeous. Romita&amp;rsquo;s lines are much cleaner and less complex and more outright heroic.</description>

      <description>As a news consumer in the 21st century, I try to measure every piece of political news that flows down my social media streams against two different questions:
 Does this piece paint the politicians in question as mercilessly, cartoonishly evil? As much as I detest Donald Trump, I do not believe that he does things because he wants to be evil. Nobody is the villain in their own stories, and an unrealistic portrait of Trump (and Ryan and McConnell and so on) can contribute to that dreaded âliberal bubbleâ that pundits warn us all about.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re throwing a short story writing contest based on our column Seattle Writing Prompts. Better yet, it&amp;rsquo;s being judged by Matt Ruff, author of six novels. His most recent, last year&amp;rsquo;s Lovecraft Country, is being turned into a series on HBO, produced by Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams. The grand prize is $100 and publication here in the Seattle Review of Books, and an interview to appear the same week as your story.</description>

      <description>**Wednesday July 5th: Reading Through It: *Dark Money***
You probably know who the Koch Brothers are âÂ those ridiculously wealthy tax-hating men who bankroll everything evil in the conservative agenda. But did you know that the Koch Brothers, as children, had a nanny who made them defecate on demand? Discuss that, and how they implemented their horrific agenda, in this monthâs book club. *Third Place Books Seward Park, 5041 Wilson Ave S, 474-2200, http://thirdplacebooks.</description>

No, Seattle doesnât have a giant book festival. Some of our most insecure public figures â the kind of folks who actually lose sleep worrying about what people in New York City think of our quaint little town â consider the lack of a Seattle Book Festival to be a major failing of our literary community.
And while we still need someone to step up and fill the place of the recently deceased APRIL Festival, I wouldnât think about trading the Short Run Comix &amp;amp; Arts Festival, say, for a giant, corporate event.</description>

      <description>Iâm in southern California.
Iâm in southern California because Seattleâs cloudy and rainy weather has finally become too much for me. The year 2017 has brought with it a few pristine sunny days, but those days have been the briefest of punctuation marks in a long, run-on sentence of gray skies and brutally cold rain. This winter has tested my patience, and I have a few days off work and so Iâm visiting some friends and following the sun.</description>

      <description>Because thereâs a sparrow outside that appears to be dying.
Because I carry it with me, not the bird, but the emotion.
Because its feathers are wet, almost drenched.
Because not knowing what to do is my own purgatory.
Because nothing in the house is sugarcoated.
Because if you position yourself at the window you will see things
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;you donât want to see.
Because there is a forest of coyotes and we keep finding the bones of fawns.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve just released sponsorship dates through January 2018. They&amp;rsquo;re going fast, but there&amp;rsquo;s still plenty of time to grab a slot.
Got a breakthrough book to promote, an amazing event, or a class or retreat that Seattle&amp;rsquo;s active community of readers and writers should know about? We&amp;rsquo;d love to help you get the word out.
Our sponsors get an exclusive presence, appearing on every page of the site for a full week, with a special mention on the home page and in our social media feeds at start and finish.</description>

When Tasmanian cartoonist Simon Hanselmann moved to Seattle, he instantly became one of the biggest cartoonists in town. His Fantagraphics comic *Megahex* attained the kind of critical and commercial success that a very small sampling of cartoonists manage to achieve in their careers. Hanselmann is a natural provocateur â in the span of a half-hour interview, he manages to say four or five things that could get him in trouble on social media if taken out of context âÂ but heâs so cheerfully sarcastic about it that you canât help but feel warmly toward him.</description>

A Pilot Explains Waypoints, the Hidden Geography of the Sky Pilot Mark Vanhoenacker&amp;#8217;s description of the invisible landmarks used to map the sky is two years old, but we plead special dispensation â this is the time of year when Seattle&amp;#8217;s skies are gloriously clear and bright, and the entire city&amp;#8217;s in a dream of summer.</description>

Some independent bookstores, progressive media outlets, and activist groups have launched new clubs to meet the moment. In Seattle thereâs âReading Through It: A Post-Election Book Club.â (First selection: J.D. Vanceâs [*Hillbilly Elegy*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/12/08/thank-you-for-coming-to-the-first-reading-through-it-book-club/), a memoir of growing up in a poor white family in what is now Trump country.</description>

      <description>If you think writers like to gossip, you should spend some time with elected officials. Nobody â not even a well-lubricated novelist â loves to gab like a politician. I was at a cocktail party a while back when a certain public official was clearly sitting on a big, juicy secret. They tried to sound nonchalant as they dropped their intel on a tight circle of Seattle-area political figures: âdid you hear?</description>

      <description>I read the first issue of Mother Panic, a comic from My Chemical Romance frontman Gerard Way&amp;rsquo;s Young Animal imprint of DC Comics, when it was first released over half a year ago. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think too much of it â the comic suffered from first-issue-itis, wherein a lot of things happened but we weren&amp;rsquo;t told why we should care.
Last week, DC published the first collected volume of Mother Panic.</description>

      <description>You donât often recognize the importance of a venue until itâs gone. If youâve lived in Seattle for more than five years, you can probably name a now-extinct rock club or bar that played a significant role in your life. Odds are good that you didnât even know youâd miss those places until they closed forever.
Town Hall Seattle is only temporarily closing its doors for a top-to-bottom remodel, but itâll be out of commission for long enough that weâll acutely feel its absence.</description>

      <description>Mark Kurlanskyâs non-fiction book about cod, titled Cod, is a critically praised bestseller thatâs bordering on modern-classic status. Itâs easy to forget that when Cod was released in 1997, nobody expected a book about a goddamned fish, of all things, to change the course of publishing. But Cod kicked off a craze of popular books devoted to the history of everyday objects âÂ Kurlanskyâs own Salt followed soon after Cod, and other books about screwdrivers and paper and rats tumbled down the pipeline.</description>

      <description>When I was a girl
I wanted to live
inside of one.
A wooden, small
place to hold me.
I was in love
with its bird
face. I imagined us
married. The dream
of domesticity. Keeping
house Ã  la bric-a-brac
or conversation piece.
But time has told
what makes them tick.
More machinations
than magic. Dark
pastoral scenes
and a stiffness
crowns the eaves.
Clockmakers all carve
the same male game</description>

*Love a little, die a little, and break the law. Trey Milligan did them all in one summer, and before his 14th birthday.* Sponsor Frank Murtaugh&#39;s debut novel, *Trey&#39;s Company*, was just released this month, and we&#39;ve got a sneak peek to share with our readers â [the intro and whole first chapter](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) â perfect timing for your summer reading list. Baseball and coming of age are a common pairing; with his background in sports writing and intimate knowledge of the story&#39;s locale, Murtaugh brings something special to the mix.</description>

      <description>Hey, Seattle writers! Please remember to apply for the LaSalle Storyteller Award, a fantastic $10,000 award from Artist Trust that goes to &amp;ldquo;an individual literary artist working in fiction.&amp;rdquo; This is a lot of cash with very few strings attached, so it&amp;rsquo;s one of the finer fiction prizes in the region. More information at Artist Trust&amp;rsquo;s site.
 And if you&amp;rsquo;d like to take a writing class this summer, you should know that today is the last day for early bird pricing for any of the Hugo House&amp;rsquo;s summer class schedule.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the true stories of Salish native women and intercultural marriage</title>

      <description>WSU Press just published the first book by Bellingham-based historian Candace Wellman. The full title gives you an idea of the topic: _Peace Weavers: Uniting the Salish Coast Through Cross-Cultural Marriages_. It&#39;s a book that follows the life stories of four indigenous women who married across cultural lines, making families with pioneer men.
While the fact of cross-cultural marriages was well known, the women in them were ignored, seen as appendages of the men, or cast in racial and gender stereotypes.</description>

San Francisco Is Burning This one&amp;#8217;s already causing a little online consternation (what doesn&amp;#8217;t, these days?): Jon Ronson investigates whether a rash of fires in San Francisco&amp;#8217;s Mission District could be arson, intended to drive out lower-income residents and make way for SF&amp;#8217;s version of the epically sky-blocking tech towers that are springing up all over Seattle.</description>

      <title>In which Cate Blanchett inhabits the texts of manifestoes despite her director&#39;s worst intentions</title>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1498107109093/blanchett.jpg)
Now that Daniel Day Lewis has announced that heâs retiring from acting, Cate Blanchett is my pick for greatest working actor in the world today. Everything about a Blanchett performance is hypnotic â it feels as though sheâs simultaneously giving everything away to the audience while still holding on to something secret, deep at the core of herself. Any film with her in it is instantly more watchable.
If youâre the kind of person who enjoys watching performance for performanceâs sake, you should definitely buy a ticket for Manifesto right now.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m hard-pressed to recall a play that feels more timely than Book-It Repertory Theatre&amp;rsquo;s adaptation of T. Geronimo Johnson&amp;rsquo;s novel Welcome to Braggsville. This play is taking America&amp;rsquo;s temperature at this very second, touching on the so-called political correctness culture of college campuses, America&amp;rsquo;s institutional racism, Southern idolatry of Confederate culture, social media obsession, and much more. Though the book was published in 2015 and the play has been in the works for well over a year, this staging is an incredibly accurate portrait of America in the summer of 2017.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Seattle&amp;rsquo;s outgoing Civic Poet, Claudia Castro Luna, announced the publication of her Seattle Poetic Grid. It&amp;rsquo;s a map of the city, with site-specific poems interlaid over it. I encourage you to go check it out; there&amp;rsquo;s lots of good stuff there, from classic seattle poems by Richard Hugo and Denise Levertov to newer poems by Julene Tripp Weaver (about University Village, of all places) and Elizabeth Austen and Lena Khalaf Tuffahha.</description>

      <description>Ever since Socrates asked that Homer be censored and the poets be exiled from his beloved republic, philosophy and poetry have been on less than civil terms. Hegel, for example, thought that poetry was no longer up to the task of representing the Absolute, and therefore must give way to philosophy. On the side of the poets, Keats, in his lengthy poem âLamia,â condemns âcold philosophyâ for her removal of beauty from the world.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re so used to the modern incarnation of shooting coverage that we never think about how odd it truly is. Things always begin with reports on Twitter of gunshots, followed by dribbling pieces of &amp;ldquo;news&amp;rdquo; â some true, many false â from eyewitnesses and local news reporters. The body count goes up and down, depending on the source. Eventually, we learn about the shooter â always a man, usually with a domestic violence incident or two in his past â and people mumble about his motive and send their respects for the dead before their attention turns elsewhere.</description>

      <description>Amazon grew its book business in large part due to showrooming: ask any bookseller and they&amp;rsquo;ll tell you horror stories of customers flipping through books, looking the title up on Amazon, and buying the book on their phone just before leaving the bookstore empty-handed.
But things have changed over the years. Amazon owns and operates several brick-and-mortar bookstores in cities around the country. They just bought Whole Foods. And so naturally they&amp;rsquo;re getting concerned about showrooming, themselves.</description>

      <description>No writer in Seattle is more interested in the raw physicality of words than Doug Nufer. Nufer is interested in the shape of words, the multiple meanings they carry, the sound of them when spoken aloud, the look of them when aligned on the page next to each other. The meat and bones of words âÂ before even the meaning imbues them with a kind of soul âÂ fascinates him.</description>

      <description>At Literary Hub, Stacie Williams writes about what it means to be a librarian:
In 1962, British librarian Douglas John Foskett wrote a paper titled *The Creed of a Librarian: No Politics, No Religion, No Morals*, in which he argued that âthe librarian ought virtually vanish as an individual person, except in so far as his personality shed light on the working of the library.â Neutrality has been enforced from the top down, with our policymaking professional organizations, down to individual librarians in their repositories, as a way of shifting the responsibility of moral judgement from librarian to patron.</description>

Charles Johnson has been one of the most influential members of Seattleâs writing community.

Johnson recently joined the writing and literacy nonprofit [Seattle 7 Writers](http://www.seattle7writers.org/), which donates to literacy organizations and donates books to readers around the region in shelters, detention centers, food banks, and other locations where people have need of good literature.</description>

      <description>Weâre not quite halfway through 2017 yet, but Iâve noticed a very visible pattern to my reading this year: Iâm not enjoying novels the way that I always have. Itâs been a while since Iâve read a novel that has really blown me away, the way memoirs from Patricia Highsmith and Sherman Alexie did this year. No novel has wowed me with its ingenuity and energy and passion, the way Claudia Rankineâs Citizen did.</description>

Tomorrow, Tatiana Gill will release her new comic Wombgenda at the Fantagraphics Bookstore &amp;amp; Gallery as part of the Comics &amp;amp; Medicine Conference. Over the last couple of years, Gill has become one of Seattle&amp;rsquo;s best, and most prolific, autobiographical cartoonists, and Wombgenda collects some of her latest work â most of it related to women&amp;rsquo;s health, but with some current events mixed in.
The three long pieces in Wombgenda address Gill&amp;rsquo;s journey to developing a positive body image, her abortion story, and an account of getting a new IUD at Country Doctor.</description>

Itâs a cold and rainy March morning in Pioneer Square, and two men in a dark suite at Clatter &amp;amp; Din recording studios are chasing after a ghost. In the next room over, Sherman Alexie is reading his memoir, You Donât Have to Say You Love Me, into a very expensive microphone. Heâs recording the audio version of Love, which is set to be released in June, but the ghost hunt is getting in the way.</description>

      <description>Seattle is an international hub of the global and public health communities. Seattle also has one of the mightiest comics scenes in the country. In almost any other year, if you were to sketch out a Venn diagram of those two communities â medicine and comics â there would be very little overlap. But this year, Seattle is host to the eighth annual Comics &amp;amp; Medicine Conference, an international celebration of the communication of medical issues in cartoon narrative form.</description>

The question of self-ârealizationâ is going to be among them, but I like to think a novel is a chance to throw dice that ask combinations of even broader questions. âWhat is the experience of being alone versus being âbesideâ somebody else?â And smaller ones: âWhat is the best way to describe that one sensation?</description>

Just play. _Letâs mess with Mrs. Flowersâ mailbox!_ Fisher and Price asked me to spy on an old witch they believed lived alone in the woods. _Is her husband dead? Or does she just hate men?_ I wondered. I wondered if she would ever come out of her shack. They tried everything to catch a glimpse of her. Sometimes they fisted worms and mud inside the black hole of it, then pushed the hard red flag up in high salute.</description>

Sponsor [Lori Tsugawa Whaley](http://loriwhaley.com), a third-generation Japanese American, was raised in a primarily Caucasian community and felt disconnected from her Japanese heritage. While exploring this ancient culture, she discovered a source of truth â the code of ethics known as *bushido*. Bushido means âthe way of the warriorâ; it is the set of chivalrous principles that governed the behavior of the ancient Japanese warriors known as samurai.
Lori Tsugawa Whaley brings these concepts to everyday life, showing through examples the kind of ethical and moral choices you can make when guided by principles.</description>

This weekend, the [eighth annual Comics &amp; Medicine Conference](http://www.graphicmedicine.org/2017-seattle-conference/) will take place in Seattle. Registration is full, but the conference also hosts a number of programs at the downtown branch of the Seattle Public Library that are free and open to the public. The conference is bringing local and international cartoonists together to discuss the many ways that narrative comics about medicine can inform, entertain, and inspire the general public.</description>

      <description>Brendan Kiley at the Seattle Times writes about a new report from the city that offers &amp;ldquo;30 ideas â some already in play â to shelter artists and communities of color from rapid development and skyrocketing rents.&amp;rdquo; You can read a PDF of the report right here. If you&amp;rsquo;re an artist or a lover of the arts who is concerned about livability in Seattle â in other words, if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this site right now âÂ it is your civic duty to read this report.</description>

Seattle novelist Neal Stephensonâs follow-up to the magisterial *Seveneves* is a co-authored novel with Nicole Galland. Itâs about a language expert who gets wrapped up in a secret government agency over some documents which supposedly prove that magic has always existed.</description>

I just bought it last night, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that Atlas #1 is the ugliest comic book I own. Only the cover, a sensitive piece by Anders Nilson featuring the titular hero holding a charred corpse while floating in a smoggy yellow haze, is aesthetically pleasing.
But flip past the cover, and the rest of this book is ugly as sin: the coloring is garish and sloppy, the art style is childlike and aggressive, and the writing is opportunistic and so drenched in irony that it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to tell if it&amp;rsquo;s a joke, or a joke about a joke, or if it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be taken entirely straight.</description>

We had some identification problems at last nightâs Reading Through It book club at Third Place Books Seward Park. Someone would be talking about âhimâ as a bully, or an ideological vacuum, or an agent of chaos. Weâd discuss âhisâ failure to behave as a normal leader, and his inability to consider his own nation as a member of an international community.
And then someone else would interrupt with a question for the sake of clarification: this âhimâ youâre referring to â are you talking about Vladimir Putin, or are you talking about Donald Trump?</description>

Yesterday, when I read former FBI director James Comey&amp;rsquo;s prepared statement to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I was struck by one particular passage:
A few moments later, the President said, &#34;I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.&#34; I didn&#39;t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner.</description>

      <description>Around the time I first read Lightning Snake, I was gifted an old vinyl of The Moody Bluesâ In Search of the Lost Chord by a regular member at the sensory deprivation tank spa where I sometimes work. On the inside of this record thereâs an artistâs note. It says: A YANTRA is used in much the same way as a mantra, although visually. The YANTRA is something that can hold the mind to a form.</description>

      <description>Buried in the belly of Pike Place Market, Chin Music Pressâs showroom might just be the best-kept secret of a bookstore in Seattle. Itâs a dreamy little shop, carrying just a few dozen titles, almost entirely all published by the local press. Youâll know a Chin Music title when you see one: itâs usually the gorgeous hardcover in the front of the bookstore that you just canât keep yourself from touching.</description>

      <description>In the New Testament, Paul is single-minded about grace. He writes about grace relentlessly, until the word becomes a catchall for pretty much anything that is good and true in the world. Grace is Godâs love. Grace is the power through which you are cleansed of sin. Grace is what gives you the will to get through another day, even though every cell in your body is telling you to stay in bed.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note to remind you that tomorrow night at 7 p.m., we&amp;rsquo;ll be at Third Place Books Seward Park to discuss Masha Gessen&amp;rsquo;s The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin. Reading this book at this particular time in history has been especially weird: without mentioning Trump at all, the book has been incredibly informative about current events.
Also, I&amp;rsquo;d urge you to listen to today&amp;rsquo;s episode of the Ezra Klein Show, which features a brand-new long interview with Gessen.</description>

      <description>The tulle veil
was bone china
white and thin.
A breakable wisp.
It was fleeting.
Mother snapped
shots of it
on Sundays.
I sat in the family
rocking chair
in the unused room
with ankles crossed.
Swirl feel
under the skirt
of my church dress.
It lived there.
A lace sash
tied off
access to
the pure me.
My holiness
sewn
delicate
as an eyelet.

Below is Schneider&#39;s follow-up email, thanking Shields for his time and recounting some of the ground they covered.
David Shields will join Claire Dederer to discuss their new books, *Other People* and *[Love and Trouble](http://www.</description>

Last Tuesday, the Seattle areaâs newest bookstore opened its doors. Located in Redmond Town Center, [Brick &amp; Mortar Books](https://www.brickandmortarbooks.com/) is a general-interest new bookstore that will carry up to 30,000 titles when its shelves are full. For the next month, Brick &amp; Mortar will be in soft-opening mode as its team of booksellers learn the ins and outs of bookselling and meet their community. On the weekend of June 23rd and 24th, the store will host its official grand opening weekend.</description>

The Loneliness of Donald Trump E. B. White said despots should fear drunken poets more than eloquent writers preaching freedom,Â but I don&amp;#8217;t know; I&amp;#8217;d be scared of the eloquent Rebecca Solnit if I were Donald Trump.</description>

      <description>The (fabulously named) Robert A. Cronkleton at the Kansas City Star wrote at the beginning of May:
Passengers at Kansas City International Airport say they recently have been asked to remove all paper products from their carry-ons while going through security screening checkpoints.
That includes all books, loose-leaf paper, Post-It notes and files. Theyâve been told by screeners that the new procedures are part of a pilot program that is being rolled out nationwide.</description>

Dear Cienna,
My husband and I are divorcing. Itâs not a bad divorce, so far as these things go. Relatively amicable.
But how should we determine who gets custody of the books without having a lawyer itemize the entirety of our bookshelves?</description>

Shout Your Abortion is presenting Dr. Willie Parker at a special Town Hall event this coming Tuesday, and attendance is required for anyone who thinks a womanâs right to choose is essential for the future of this country. At this special event to celebrate the publication of *Lifeâs Work*, Parker will be introduced by Seattle celebrity Lindy West, who helped Amelia Bonow get SYA off the ground, and Parker will be interviewed by staunch SYA ally Martha Plimpton, who appeared most recently as the mom in the sitcom *The Real OâNeals*.</description>

      <description>Fantagraphics Books is publishing a new comics anthology, titled Now. And Fantagraphics associate publisher Eric Reynolds explained to the Comics Reporter&amp;rsquo;s Tom Spurgeon that the idea for Now came straight out of Seattle:  The idea really coalesced after last year&#39;s Short Run festival. I went to that show with a plan to really canvas the show and see what was there. I don&#39;t get to actually shop extensively at shows very often, and I ended up dropping close to a couple of hundred bucks, buying anything that looked even remotely interesting.</description>

      <description>The future of comic books is not superheroes; itâs young adult fiction. If you look back on the last fifteen years or so of popular comics bestsellers, itâs pretty easy to track the direction of reader and creator interest, from Mark Millar to Bryan Lee OâMalley to Faith Erin Hicks. Itâs not as big a shift as, say, the death of the western novel, but itâs definitely there: whereas comics used to be serialized monthly to large and eager audiences, weâre seeing more and more trilogies starring young characters (mostly girls) released in large chunks once a year or so.</description>

Scaachi Koul writes about culture for BuzzFeed. Her new, much-chatted-about collection of comic essays is about growing up in an Indian-Canadian family. Tonight, sheâll be in conversation with Seattleâs own Lindy West, who, as you may have heard, knows a thing or two about comedic essays.

Love him or hate him, Ronald Reagan was always a storyteller. As an actor, he wasn&amp;rsquo;t especially gifted, but he devoted himself to the schmaltzy stories as best he could. Reagan really found his storytelling gift when he became a politician â when he headed the Screen Actor&amp;rsquo;s Guild and then went on a speaking tour to promote political values. And then, in 1980, he took on the role of a lifetime.</description>

      <description>Seattle nonprofit Shout Your Abortion really hit a nerve with its name. Founder Amelia Bonow took a lot of flack from self-described progressives when she started the organization: they supported the organization&amp;rsquo;s calling, they would say, but then they would hem and haw for a second before getting to the point: isnât it in bad taste, theyâd stammer, to âshoutâ abortions?
They have it entirely wrong, of course. They think the name Shout Your Abortion is aimed at right-wing religious conservatives, when in fact the name has more to do with them.</description>

Sponsor Anne Mendel delivered us a full chapter from her comically twisted dark novel _Etiquette for an Apocalypse_. Set in Portland in 2020, Mendel gives us a future when humanity is falling apart, people are fending for themselves, but the protagonist&#39;s mother still insists on dressing for dinner. What standards should we hold as society collapses around us?
Read the first full chapter on our sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page &amp;mdash; we think you&amp;rsquo;ll really enjoy it.</description>

      <description>Iâve written before about the blow suffered by Seattleâs literary community when poet Joan Swift died in March. At 90 years old, Swift represented a clear link to Seattleâs literary past (she was one of Seattle poetry godfather Theodore Roethkeâs last students), and given her propensity to guide and encourage younger poets, her influence will be felt for many decades to come.
I talked with Swiftâs friends about her life and legacy, and everyone had a favorite Swift poem, a work that would burrow deep into their chests and change them forever.</description>

      <description>This past Saturday, I walked around Lake Washington. It was 52 miles âÂ the longest Iâve ever walked, or, likely, will ever walk, in a single day â and it took from 4 in the morning until 9:30 at night.
If you ever wanted to understand the great economic disparities in King County, Iâd urge you to circle Lake Washington. The Loop Trail, which at times doesnât hew very closely to the contours of the lake, will take you near some of the poorest neighborhoods in the region and through some of the wealthiest.</description>

entangled in wide streaks of light
that, in the daytime, bloom,
unsparing, bright &amp;mdash; like operatic
high notes. Pierced and round,
the clouds of sleep fill us with
sound. A loss. A tune so deep within
the brain we cannot help but weep

We wanted to spotlight him because for well over a decade, he was one of the best-respected writers in town â one of those rare selfless authors who would show up as a sign of support at book launch parties even when he wasnât scheduled to read.</description>

      <description>Seattle&amp;rsquo;s Office of Arts &amp;amp; Culture is accepting applications for its CityArtist Projects grant, which provides funds for artists seeking to complete a project. The grant changes disciplines every year, and literary artists are up for consideration this year. You have 55 days left to apply, so get to it.
 Ted Closson&amp;rsquo;s cartoon at The Nib titled &amp;ldquo;A GoFundMe Campaign Is Not Health Insurance&amp;rdquo; is required reading. It seems that every day I see another writer or musician or artist in medical distress whose lives depend on the outcome of a GoFundMe campaign.</description>

      <description>Writer Chris Offutt reports on Twitter:
Yes, it&amp;#39;s true. Denis Johnson died yesterday morning. He was at home, peaceful.
&amp;mdash; Chris Offutt (@Chris_Offutt) May 26, 2017 Based on the high number of mourning authors on my Twitter feed right now, it&amp;rsquo;s fair to characterize Johnson as a writer&amp;rsquo;s writer âÂ one of the greats, a talent so advanced that it mystifies peers.
Jesus&amp;rsquo; Son has to be one of the best short story collections of the 20th century, and The Name of the World is a magnificent short novel about grief and loss and people-shaped holes in lives.</description>

With its friendly staff, shedloads of books, and cool author signings, the Seattle Mystery Bookshop is one of the loveliest jewels in the cityâs literary crown. Keep an eye on their event calendar , which showcases the best of mystery writers, local, regional, national and international. On the radar for summer: Cara Black, creator of the astute Parisian PI Aimee Leduc, drops in at noon on Wednesday, June 14, and on July 5, the excellent Jill Dawson, over from England, signs The Crime Writer, her canny fictional melding of Patricia Highsmith, a sleepy Suffolk village, and a spot of murder.</description>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1495606462750/riseofthedungeonmaster.jpg)
It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of nerdception: Rise of the Dungeon Master is a biography of Gary Gygax, inventor of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, told in comic book form. Writer David Kushner and artist Koren Shadmi do excellent work transforming what could be an incredibly dry subject âÂ Gygax&amp;rsquo;s slow construction of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons from pieces of miniatures-based military reenactment games â into a breezy biographical story. Rise is a book that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t work, for several important reasons.</description>

And when Gibson is not retweeting current events that sound like he invented them 25 years ago, he is complaining that the future is moving too damn fast:

The Northwest Immigrant and Refugee Health Coalition is assembling a panel of refugees to discuss what itâs like to become a refugee in this country, and what life in America for refugees is like right now.

      <description>At The Guardian, Danuta Kean wrote a very good post about people who feel compelled to tag writers on social media with their very negative book reviews:
Others seem genuinely to think they are helping the writer by telling them they hated their latest work. All seem blissfully unaware that as a far as the author is concerned, their feedback is unwanted. Their tweet or post is on a level with a stranger shouting abuse in the street.</description>

      <description>Nobodyâs ever accused Paul Mullin of being soft. Back when Mullin was a playwright, he wrote stories about genius brains being turned to slurry from aggressive radiation poisoning and monstrous men who recall their own horrific acts even through the blessed fog of amnesia. Mullin wrote long screeds about what was wrong with American theater (spoiler alert: basically, everything), and he wasnât afraid to make enemies. Then, about four years ago, he retired from theater.</description>

      <description>Writing theater criticism always made me slightly uncomfortable; specifically, I hated to write negative reviews. I have no trouble writing negative reviews of books, but there&amp;rsquo;s something about the vulnerability and teamwork of a play â a group of people coming together for little to no money in order to strut across a stage and mimic emotional states â that I hate to criticize.
There&amp;rsquo;s not really a logical framework behind any of this.</description>

      <description>Does your organization need diversity training? If you&amp;rsquo;re an arts organization in Seattle, the answer is probably yes. This Saturday in the 2100 Building at 1:30 p.m., two local artists with lots of experience in the topic are hosting a &amp;ldquo;public discussion about the pros and cons of working with professionals, consultants, and hands-on-experts to facilitate an anti-racist work environment.&amp;rdquo; Entry fees range from $5 to $20, though nobody will be turned away for lack of funds.</description>

      <description>A cart carrying a metric ton of apples leaves the city at four meters per second. Another cart leaves the city carrying a boy, in love with an idea. Consider the swirl of laughter and personal tragedy at 6 meters per second. Say the idea does not love him back. Say he will lose his life in a maze of regrets. What can be said about the dust caked on the wheel spokes and the precarious sway of the chasse crossing over ruts and the staggered pavers knuckled together side by side.</description>

Read the first full chapter on our sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page &amp;mdash; we think you&amp;rsquo;ll really enjoy it. Visit Portland in the near future, and learn all about survival in a high-rise condo during the apocalypse.</description>

On Saturday, SIFF presented the West Coast premiere of Bad Black, an action movie from the Ugandan micro-movie studio of Wakaliwood. An American producer named Alan Hofmanis was in attendance to present the film and lead a Skype Q&amp;amp;A with director Nabwana I.G.G.
From a storytelling perspective, Wakaliwood films are unique in all the world. Hofmanis explained the history stretches back some three decades, when VHS tapes of American action films started circulating around the poorest parts of Uganda.</description>

We were both students at Cornish College of the Arts, studying design, at the close of the Twentieth Century. A Russian who came to design school after studying architecture in her home country, her approach to design was always engaged, probing, and driven.
We&#39;d occasionally stay in touch, but I hadn&#39;t talked to her in years when I heard she was one of the first round of writers (along with Seattle writer Scott Berkun) to be [awarded the Amtrak Residency](http://blog.</description>

Last night I decided to go to the movies for the simple reason that after a week of relentless breaking news stories about Donald Trump, two hours in a dark room with my phone turned off sounded like some kind of paradise. I decided to go to an opening night screening of Alien: Covenant. It was a pretty film, and Michael Fassbender turns in an excellent performance, but the movie was ultimately pretty bad âÂ it was a horror movie that forgot to be scary, a philosophical movie that wasn&amp;rsquo;t very smart to begin with, a space exploration movie with no joy to it.</description>

      <title>Thursday Comics Hangover: Wonder Women</title>

      <description>I havenât had much to say about superhero movies lately â sorry, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, itâs not you, itâs me â but I do agree with the consensus that the movies made from DC Comics superheroes have been disastrous. Batman V Superman was one of the worst blockbusters Iâve ever seen. Suicide Squad was even worse. Iâll be watching the Wonder Woman movie when it debuts at Cinerama in a couple of weeks, but that feels more like an act of obligation: I want to support the first female superhero movie in a generation, even though Gal Gadot has never once ever successfully, in the technical sense of the word, acted.</description>

Something very strange happens when you get a bunch of book peopleÂ â booksellers and librarians, say â to sit down at a bar with a bunch of people who work with movies, like projectionists and film bookers. Usually, all the book people want to talk about is movies: whatâs coming out, what this movie star was like when she visited town for a special screening, what working at a movie theater is like.</description>

      <description>Seattle novelist Matt Ruff&amp;rsquo;s excellent novel Lovecraft Country started its life as a pitch for a television show. Now, the Hollywood Reporter says the cycle is complete, as Lovecraft Country (the novel) is heading to HBO. And Get Out director Jordan Peele is producing it, along with J.J. Abrams&amp;rsquo; Bad Robot production company:
The drama â described as an anthological horror series that reclaims genre storytelling from the African-American perspective â hails from Peele&#39;s Monkeypaw Productions, as well as Bad Robot and Warner Bros.</description>

      <description>Nobody makes writing sound more romantic, important, and magical than a writer, and thatâs why writing about writers is a writerâs favorite pastime. Visit any bookstoreâs how-to-write section and youâll find volume after volume that describes writing as an art and a craft and a calling and a sacred trust. A writer can make writing sound like the most important calling in the world, and the only thing writers love to do more than publicly praise the work of another writer is to talk shit about other writers in the bar after the reading.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve known for years that Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams is a dipshit men&amp;rsquo;s rights activist. He compares women who want equal pay to children. He&amp;rsquo;s said awful things about consent. He endorsed Donald Trump and praised his &amp;ldquo;clown genius&amp;rdquo; for a year before the election.
Adams may be a jackass, but he is not, strictly speaking, an idiot. He&amp;rsquo;s kept his politics out of his comic strip, because he understands that people like Dilbert for its inane &amp;ldquo;boy-oh-boy-bosses-sure-do-suck-am-I-right?</description>

None of the Above. If a boy walks down this path and it is summer and he hums a song from childhood will he pick A, B, C, D or choose E? Will he smell D&#39;s metallic hook and think of how gardenias are loudest in the heat?</description>

      <description>You simply must read this New York Times story about a community in Oregon that voted to kill its libraries.
For generations in America, small cities like this declared their optimism and civic purpose with grand libraries that rose above the clutter of daily life and commerce. But last fall, Douglas County residents voted down a ballot measure that would have added about $6 a month to the tax bill on a median-priced home and saved the libraries from a funding crisis.</description>

Cory Doctorow &amp;mdash; father, skull-collector, multiple award-winning author, BoingBoing blog contributor, and revolutionary advocate for humankind&#39;s unrestricted internet access &amp;mdash; appears in Seattle on Monday, May 15, to discuss his latest science fiction novel, _Walkaway_, with friend and fellow award-winner Neal Stephenson. But SRoB columnist Nisi Shawl got him to grant a phone interview first. The (lightly edited) transcription below mercifully does not reflect the technical and recording difficulties overcome; rather it allows you to revel in Cory&#39;s deep yet fast-paced flow of thought.</description>

I also pointed out that no publisher has put together a truly great, comprehensive comics cookbook. In comments on Facebook, though, a few readers pointed out that there are some more comics recipes out there for you to enjoy.
Chris suggested Tyler Capps&amp;rsquo;s weekly comic strip Cooking Comically. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard of this one before. Capps uses a blend of photography and comics to lay out his recipes.</description>

      <description>This book doesnât exist, but it should. Imagine it: itâs a giant, full-color, hardcover affair âÂ sturdy and substantial. The kind of book that forces a little grunt out of you when you pull it off the shelf. The kind of book that thuds onto a kitchen counter like an announcement, like a statement of purpose.
Itâs a cookbook. But itâs not like any cookbook that youâve ever seen before. Once you flip it open, youâll see why: itâs a comic book.</description>

      <description>It was a loss that felt like the fluttering turn of a page. When Seattle-area poet Joan Swift passed away back in March, friends and fans expressed their grief in many ways. They shared stories about Swiftâs generosity of spirit, her candor as an artist, and her tireless devotion to the craft. But the most common sentiment, the one shared by people who spent years with Swift in their lives and by people who had never once met her, was that Swiftâs passing was a sad and significant moment in Seattle literary history, a loss of generational proportions.</description>

      <description>Thick as Thieves, the excellent young Seattle-based comics newspaper, is running a Patreon to fund future issues. If you put in $5 a month, you&amp;rsquo;ll get five copies of every new issue of the paper. (Admittedly, Thick as Thieves is a free paper, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have to explain to you that art is worth money, do I?)
 Yes, Bill Clinton and literary sweatshop owner James Patterson are &amp;ldquo;collaborating&amp;rdquo; on a novel about a missing president.</description>

I believe in acting my age and not

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a weekend lover, and in the hard work

I believe in paisley and purple.

      <description>A post shared by The Seattle Review of Books (@seattlereviewof) on May 6, 2017 at 10:27am PDT
 
Free Comic Book Day seems to have been a success all over the city of Seattle. On Saturday, I walked a route stretching from Fremont through downtown and up to Capitol Hill, and every one of the five stores I stopped in was packed with customers. And these customers were people who likely never would&amp;rsquo;ve felt comfortable in a Seattle comics shop in the mid-1990s: women, people of color, families with young children.</description>

      <title>&#34;I&#39;m being so manipulative:&#34; Cathy Malkasian&#39;s latest comic is a polemic against social media</title>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1493969786851/earthacover.jpeg)
Cathy Malkasianâs fourth comic, *Eartha*, is a tense and gorgeous journey. Reading Malkasianâs comics is perhaps the closest equivalent to dreaming that you can experience while youâre awake. The comics feel raw and mysterious and unsettling and more than a little dangerous.
The titular character in *Eartha* is a naÃ¯ve young woman who sets out to return dreams to her society. The book feels entirely set in the subconscious â a world in which people read four-word news blurbs printed on biscuits and then perform their emotions of distress about the news in public.</description>

      <description>The library looks gorgeous and the plan for it to be a community center in the South Side of Chicago is wonderful. Something that I&amp;rsquo;m not happy about: it&amp;rsquo;s going to be the first paperless presidential library. You&amp;rsquo;d think that a president who loves books as much as Obama would understand the value of the printed word. In a world full of bad news, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend too much time or energy complaining about this.</description>

      <description>Congratulations are due to Seattle&amp;rsquo;s own Fantagraphics Books, which cleaned up in the Eisner Awards nominations this week. (The Eisners are the comics version of the Oscars.) Fnatagraphics picked up more nominations than almost any other publisher. Go help them celebrate tomorrow by visiting their store for Free Comic Book Day.
 We haven&amp;rsquo;t seen a lot of new work from Seattle author Stacey Levine in a while. Levine, who writes delicately crafted sentences that shine like jewels and howl with the wind of alien planets, hasn&amp;rsquo;t published a book since 2011.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s strange: Most everyone at the Reading Through It Book Club last night agreed that Jonathan Haidt&amp;rsquo;s book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided By Politics and Religion was the most useful book we&amp;rsquo;ve read so far in our quest to understand the presidency of Donald Trump. One book club member even said that she felt if she had read The Righteous Mind before the election, she&amp;rsquo;d probably have been able to predict that Trump would win.</description>

      <description>Ordinarily, I use this space to write about the comics that I&amp;rsquo;ve read over the past week. But this Saturday is Free Comic Book Day â that nationwide celebration of the belief that there&amp;rsquo;s a comic out there for everyone â and so we&amp;rsquo;re going to look forward for a change. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never participated before, you should know that it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple: walk into the store, get some comics for free.</description>

      <description>Spokane-by-way-of-Seattle author Kate Lebo&amp;rsquo;s poem &amp;ldquo;A Prayer to Cathy McMorris Rodgers for Intercession on My Behalf&amp;rdquo; at Blood Orange Review is exactly what a political poem should be: it is reasonable, and passionate, and meaningful. The poem is aimed directly at McMorris Rodgers, who is Lebo&amp;rsquo;s Congressional representative, and it&amp;rsquo;s a plea for the congresswoman to remember everyone that she represents in the House. On this week when House Republicans seem to be considering, yet again, the repeal of Obamacare, the poem lands with a special weight.</description>

      <description>Every year, the Seattle Public Library chooses one book to headline its âSeattle Readsâ program. The idea is to get as many copies of a single title into as many hands as possible, to bring the author to as many of Seattleâs neighborhoods as they can in a single week, and to examine a book thoroughly. Itâs a noble idea and it raises some interesting questions about place and readership: does Ballard, say, read a book differently than Rainier Valley?</description>

      <description>Funny poems are tough to pull off. Iâm not talking, here, about poems with humor in them; almost every good poem has at least one funny thing smuggled inside of it. No, I mean poems with punchlines, poems written with the intent of making readers laugh out loud. Those are very hard to get right; too often, funny poems veer into dad joke territory. They try too hard, they screech too loud, and they flop gracelessly.</description>

Tomorrow night at Third Place Books Seward Park at 7 pm, I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll join Seattle Weekly editor-in-chief Mark Baumgarten and myself and my Seattle Review of Books cofounder Martin McClellan in a discussion of Jonathan Haidt&amp;rsquo;s amazing book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion.
The May installment of our Reading Through It book club is more theoretical and less interested in current events.</description>

      <description>I walk the narrow pedestrian passage
illumined so its girdered ribs show
like names on a ledger. Every step
sudden and trochaic &amp;mdash; the beginning
of facts. Of being here.
I look up and see the moon
is brandishing its ghosts. What is
here and not here. What is
a face in the sky. What breaks
the shape of the known and obvious.
If I could say it, I would say</description>

      <description>Back when he was just a presidential candidate, I wrote about Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s love of the poem &amp;ldquo;The Snake.&amp;rdquo;. Over the weekend, President Trump read the poem again. As Chris Cillizza points out, the poem has a very different meaning, now that Trump is Commander-in-Chief.</description>

Sponsor Brian McKreevy&#39;s new novel _The Lights_ is being released next week. It&#39;s a philosophical inquiry into the nature of how we connect in our most intimate bonds &amp;mdash; and, bonus, it starts when gifted writer Leda Galvan moves to Austin to join an MFA program. It&#39;s an examination of love and art, all set in Texas among aspirational writers.
That&amp;rsquo;s something McKreevy knows all about &amp;mdash; he was a James Michener Fellow in fiction and screenwriting at the University of Texas.</description>

      <description>This Saturday, every comic book store in the greater Seattle Area will celebrate [Free Comic Book Day](http://www.freecomicbookday.com/), an industry-specific holiday. FCBD is exactly what it sounds like: stores give away free comics â traditionally samplers of new and upcoming series that publishers would like to promote to new readers â to anyone who visits.

For many years, the Wallingford shop [Comics Dungeon](http://www.comicsdungeon.com/) has put on Seattleâs greatest Free Comic Book Day show, with guest creator appearances, signings, and cosplayers dressed like superheroes or pop culture characters.</description>

      <description>*(Once in a while, I take a new book with me to lunch and give it a half an hour or so to grab my attention. Lunch Date is my judgment on that speed-dating experience.)*
**Whoâs your date today?** [*Exit West*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735212176), a novel by Mohsin Hamid.
**Whereâd you go?** I was in Tacoma for a day trip and stopped by [the MSM Deli](https://www.zomato.com/tacoma-wa/msm-deli-tacoma/menu), a legendary lunch spot that doesn&#39;t offer much by way of ambiance â it&#39;s a convenience store with some card tables â but enjoys a large Northwest fanbase.</description>

Sometimes we hear about events too late to get them in the readings calendar for the week, but we still think they&amp;rsquo;re worthy events that you should know about. Here are two:
 Tomorrow from 3 to 6 pm, it&amp;rsquo;s Trivia for a Cause at Green Bean Coffeehouse in Greenwood. This event is a fundraiser for the Eastside Mosque, which was damaged in an arson fire back in January. There will be readings from Seattle poet Samar Abulhassan, eight rounds of trivia, and a set from comedian Wilfred Padua.</description>

      <description>Today, at the ass-end of National Poetry Month, is Poem In Your Pocket Day, which poets.org urges you to celebrate by &amp;ldquo;selecting a poem, carrying it with you, and sharing it with others throughout the day at schools, bookstores, libraries, parks, and workplaces.&amp;rdquo;
Don&amp;rsquo;t have a poem in your pocket? You can always print one out. This poem is eminently pocket-sized. Also, this one. Open Books, which has been all over this National Poetry Month thing this year, is celebrating Poem in Your Pocket Day by giving away pocket poems all day to customers.</description>

      <description>Not so very long ago, if you were a kid and you wanted to read comics, you had a couple of choices: you could either read superhero comics, or you could read Archie comics. Now, the young adult comics scene is positively thriving. Teens can find realistic comics, fantasy comics, sci-fi comics, adventure comics, and romance comics in just about any comic book store.
In the last month, Image Comics has released a pair of new YA books that demonstrate the breadth and depth of the field.</description>

      <description>Patricia Lockwood is one of the best poets working in America today. Plenty of critics try to diminish that standing by dinging Lockwood for successfully using the internet like an adult human in the year 2017. In the first sentence of her review of Lockwoodâs new book, Priestdaddy, Financial Times critic Suzi Feay praises Lockwood backhandedly for âher zany mastery of Twitter.â James Parker in his Atlantic review of Priestdaddy sniffs that âLike Donald Trump, [Lockwood] does pretty well on Twitter.</description>

You â being the discerning lover of literature and an ardent supporter of local businesses staffed by real, live humans that you are â donât need me to tell you why independent bookstores are the motherfucking cultural glue that holds our entire city together. So youâll obviously want to head out to your two or three favorite bookstores to buy a book or two, say hi, and enjoy some special events.</description>

      <description>I quit drinking almost ten years ago now, so guest-starring on an episode of Drunk Booksellers, in which booksellers get drunk and talk about books, presented a unique problem. The solution, however, was pretty simple, since the hosts and I all live in Washington state: get high! It was a special honor to appear on the first-ever pot-centric Drunk Booksellers episode.
The shownotes for the episode are fantastically detailed and contain links to every book we discussed.</description>

It was a warm afternoon. Sun dabbled in the greenhouse.
So now I revise and revise until I think the real writing
is rewriting. First drafts are small forays into the hills
from which I bring back a pail half full of unripe
blueberries that may, on closer look, be
some other kind of fruit entirely. I remember

If you&#39;re looking to understand what went wrong with the Democratic Party over the last few years, this is the book for you: Frank explains that Democratic leaders have over time shifted the Democrats from a working-class party to a league of meritocratic professional elites.

      <description>After the 2008 and 2012 elections, I was very much enthralled by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin&amp;rsquo;s quick-published insidery accounts of the presidential campaigns. Game Change and Game Change: Double Down both piqued my interest with their gossipy tone and their inside-baseball chattiness.
Now, of course, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious that Mark Halperin is an awful person, and an even worse journalist; he sucked up to Donald Trump at just about every opportunity during the 2016 elections.</description>

(Technically, it was issue #0; the first issue of Secret Empire â as in the issue marked &amp;ldquo;#1&amp;rdquo; â is due on May 3rd. If you&amp;rsquo;re already confused, I apologize for what I&amp;rsquo;m about to put you through.) Every once in a while I like a big superhero crossover if it&amp;rsquo;s handled well, and I enjoyed Nick Spencer&amp;rsquo;s run on Ant-Man a while ago.</description>

      <description>A dark photo of Thomas Frank describing our dark political present at Town Hall Seattle.
A post shared by The Seatttle Review of Books (@seattlereviewof) on Apr 18, 2017 at 7:55pm PDT
 
âI apologize for standing up so high,â Thomas Frank announced from behind the podium at Town Hall Seattle last night. He observed that the audience members who gathered by the stage to ask him questions were forced to gaze up at him, as though he was a wizened old man sitting at the peak of a mountain.</description>

      <title>Bill O&#39;Reilly is out at Fox News. What about his career as a bestselling writer?</title>

      <description>Good news! Now that all the allegations against Bill O&amp;rsquo;Reilly have finally gotten public attention, Fox News has kicked the man to the curb, canceling his O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Factor TV show. It&amp;rsquo;s embarrassing that it took this long, but it&amp;rsquo;s good to see that activism eventually pays off.
However. O&amp;rsquo;Reilly is also a bestselling writer â or more likely, &amp;ldquo;writer&amp;rdquo; â of historical books. His books warp and twist history into something that is barely recognizeable, but they sell like the proverbial hotcakes.</description>

**Wednesday April 19th: *The Book of Joan* Reading**
Portland novelist Lidia Yuknavitch is a Northwest superstar. Her prickly, gorgeous fiction is at recognizable and more than a little bit scary. (Itâs scary in part because it is so recognizable.) Yuknavitchâs latest, *The Book of Joan*, is a sci-fi novel that retells the story of Joan of Arc in a blasted-out dystopic wasteland. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.</description>

      <description>It is probably no mistake that some of the best poets are translators. While translating poetry from one language into another is an impossible, thankless taskÂ â Iâve heard it described as performing open heart surgery with a chainsaw â it still teaches you to ask all the right questions.
Why did the poet use this word in that particular spot? Does a line break mean the same in this language as it does in the original language?</description>

      <description>Itâs easy for newcomers to be deterred by the hills or the rain, but the truth is that Seattle is one of the most walkable cities in the country. Unlike, say, the ugly monotony of Florida cities or the imposing boulevards of California cities, Seattle feels pedestrian-sized. Thereâs enough happening on street level to reward a wandererâs attention, and there are enough straight-shot trails available between neighborhoods to make long-distance travel relatively easy.</description>

      <description>A couple weeks ago, I listened to the podcast S-Town. It was exactly as compelling as youâve heard â a story of death and crime and poverty and hatred and mental illness. Of course the story of S-Town is more complex than just whatâs in the narrativeâÂ the way itâs told, the elements of the story that donât appear in the audio, are part of the podcastâs puzzle-box fascination.
It occurred to me as I was listening to S-Town, though, that fifteen years ago, before the dawn of podcasts, the story almost certainly would have arrived in the form of a book.</description>

      <description>All the cell phone towers are pagodas
from the top floor through my near-sighted eyesâ
blue, white, red shimmering houses
for ancient gods among the fir trees and dogwood.
They climb the hills to the cemetery, carrying
the voices of the living far above the lost
chatter of those already gone before us.
The words are like raindrops in a summer storm
here then gone, sadness borne away
over the continents.</description>

      <description>When news broke last month that Joan Swift had died, the Seattle literary community erupted in outpourings of grief. A shared sensation spread quickly around Facebook that something momentous had passed with her. At 90 years old, Swift was well-loved by many generations of Seattle writers, and she provided a direct link to the history of Northwest literature. She was one of the last living writers to learn directly from Seattle poetry godfather Theodore Roethke, and she shepherded generations of writers out of anonymity and into maturity.</description>

MacDonald says the prize is given to &amp;ldquo;the best graphic novel, fiction or non-fiction, published in the previous calendar year by a living U.S. or Canadian citizen or resident. Itâs definitely one of the most prestigious awards for a graphic novel given out each year.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Alec Baldwin reads from his new memoir Nevertheless at the Paramount tonight. It&amp;rsquo;s sold out.
If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about buying Baldwin&amp;rsquo;s memoir, you should know that Baldwin is openly complaining about the job his editors did on the book. Danuta Kean at The Guardian notes:
The 59-year-old actor has attacked his publisher HarperCollins, accusing the editors of poor proofreading. In his first post on a Facebook page set up to promote his new autobiography, *Nevertheless*, he claimed the published edition âcontains SEVERAL typos and errors which I was more than a little surprised to seeâ.</description>

Dear Cienna,
Everyone calls comics âgraphic novels,â but a lot of great comics, like *Persepolis* and *Fun Home*, are non-fiction. So ânovelâ isnât right. But some comics arenât funny at all, and so âcomicâ books doesnât make sense, either.</description>

      <description>Like so many of the best books, I found it hidden behind a couple outdated computer programming manuals in a Goodwill. Itâs a tall, slim hardcover book with a torn dustjacket. The cover is a soulful color sketch of a tiny figure standing on a roof staring out at a cloudy night sky. It says in big letters at the top, The Man, and below that, in smaller print, the author credit: Raymond Briggs.</description>

      <description>When I was growing up I believed that history happened elsewhere â Plymouth Rock, the Alamo, the Oregon Trail. I never thought of National City, where I lived, as having a history. Even though we learned in fourth grade that the first Californians were Indians, the implication we received was that they had vanished with the progress of âcivilization.â
Several years ago, my sister sent me a book called Early National City issued by Arcadia Publishing, the âleading local history publisher in the United States.</description>

**Wednesday April 12th: * Krazy* Reading**
George Herriman was Americaâs very first cartooning genius. His strip Krazy Kat depicted more than just a love triangle between a cat, a brick-throwing mouse, and a canine police officerÂ âÂ it laid out the cartooning language that we still see in modern comics. Michael Tisserandâs biography of Herriman finally gives the genius his due. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, elliottbaybook.</description>

      <description>In July of 2015 on the website Very Smart Brothas, Damon Young wrote a blog post titled âSerena Williams Drinks, Bathes In, and Makes Lemonade with White Tears.â The next day, he published a post titled âWhite Tears, Explained, for White People Who Donât Get It.â It seems that his original post about Serena Williams inspiring white tears had inspired some white tears of its own. Young quoted a white readerâs response to his article: âItâs disturbing how it seems many black people resent white people, when we all bleed the same color.</description>

      <description>I hope you&amp;rsquo;re keeping up on the Phinney Books Resist List, a regularly updated list of civically minded books for sale through their website and in their store. Twenty percent of all Resist List sales will benefit the ACLU. This is the sort of thing that independent bookstores are great at, and it&amp;rsquo;s another way to stay involved in a time when every day brings with it a series of new political horrors.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re the kind of person who prefers to read series once they&amp;rsquo;re through, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck! Last week&amp;rsquo;s series of pieces profiling new Seattle publisher Mount Analogue is over. You should read my interview with Mount Analogue publisher Colleen Louise Barry and my reviews of Mount Analogue&amp;rsquo;s books: the erasure series now on display at Open Books, the terrific collection of poetry by Ted Powers, the amazing tone poem constructed solely from captioned screenshots of episodes of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, and the pamphlet series that reimagines the idea of magazines using an ancient form of political communication.</description>

      <description>I stepped down from the trolley that day in Hiroshima
and walked by the river where the children had floated in flames,
but I could not hear their cries of misu, misu. Lost.
I saw the rowboats tied to the shore waiting for the living,
and the Prefecture building as the autumn wind
blew through the skeletal dome and every leaf lay scattered.
I passed by heaps of flowers and burning candles</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I feel as though this year&amp;rsquo;s list of Pulitzer Prize winners is a perfect representation of the year&amp;rsquo;s work. David Fahrenthold of the Washington Post did excellent work dogging Donald Trump all year long. Oakland&amp;rsquo;s East Bay Times is a great paper that never gets recognized for its excellent work.
And the book choices are exactly as they should be. Colson Whitehead&amp;rsquo;s brilliant novel The Underground Railroad absolutely deserved to win the prize.</description>

Northwest writer Jeffrey Warren &amp;mdash; a long time Seattle resident &amp;mdash; set his latest book _Justifiable Homicide_ largely in the city, amongst our high-tech firms. It covers investigative reporting, drug rings, computer _wunderkinds_, and most notably: encryption. A subject Warren knows well: he&#39;s an entrepreneur and engineer.
We&amp;rsquo;ve run the full first chapter from Justifiable Homicide on our Sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page. If you like gripping thrillers, we think you&amp;rsquo;ll like what you find there.</description>

It costs $35, and all proceeds benefit the International Rescue Committee. It looks absolutely gorgeous, too.</description>

      <description>Grab Back Comics is a site that collects and publishes comics about sexual assault, harassment, advocacy, and consent education. Itâs produced, edited, written, and curated by a Seattle cartoonist who uses the pseudonym âErma Blood.â In person, Blood is thoughtful and eloquent. When the conversation turns to abuse stories, sheâs always quick to turn the focus to survivorsÂ âÂ what they need, what they feel, how to help. In less than an hour, the immense reserves of compassion and consideration sheâs poured into the topic becomes apparent.</description>

When Pat Buchanan Tried to Make America Great Again This piece by Sam Tanenhaus is a vivid history of Nixon&amp;#8217;s 1968 presidential campaign, with direct lines via Pat Buchanan to Donald Trump&amp;#8217;s victory last year.</description>

      <description>Seattle Writing Prompts are intended to spark ideas for your writing, based on locations and stories of Seattle. Write something inspired by a prompt? [Send it to us](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about)! We&#39;re looking to publish writing sparked by prompts.
Also, how are we doing? Are writing prompts useful to you? Could we be doing better? [Reach out](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about) if you have ideas or feedback. We&#39;d love to hear.
The first thing you need to know about the Terminal Sales Building &amp;mdash; besides its oddly specific and wonderful name &amp;mdash; is that its address is 1923 1st Avenue, and guess what year it opened?</description>

Individually, these pamphlets are not much to look atâÂ a page or two of color paper, printed neatly, folded in a tight crease down the middle, and stapled. Bundled together in stacks of five, though, theyâre quite substantial. On the back of every individual pamphlet is the name of the publisher (Mount Analogue,) the publication credit (âRisograph printing by Paper Press Punch,â) a website (www.mount-analogue.com,) and the date of publication, as well as this disclaimer:</description>

Dear Cienna,
If one more douchey techbro tells me that TV shows are the new novels, Iâm going to lose my mind. Itâs become the stock response when I tell my coworkers that I enjoy reading.</description>

Not what it used to be The future science fiction depicts has never been the future. So-called Golden Age SFFH of the late 1930s to mid-1940s projected its timesâ values and aesthetics onto imaginary eras flung far over the event horizon. Robert A. Heinleinâs literal space cadets, like his juvenile hero Matt Dodson, are all heterosexual men, though daringly cosmopolitan in their inclusion of differing nationalities &amp;mdash; one of them even speaks French!</description>

What We Do Now: Standing Up for Your Values in Trump&amp;rsquo;s America was announced right after Election Day last year. It was published right before Inauguration Day this year. A two-month window is incredibly small for the wholesale creation of a book â particularly one like What We Do Now, which anthologizes recent writing by big-name authors like Dave Eggers, George Saunders, Gloria Steinem, Robert Reich, and Elizabeth Warren. Ordinarily a work like this would span at least a year from inception to publication date.</description>

      <description>You might find it hard to keep your footing if you charge at the poems in Ted Powersâs new collection Manners in the conventional way. Breaking into the first line and barreling straight down to the bottom doesnât work. If you read these poems from beginning to end, itâs easy to get lost and turned around, until you start chasing after yourself in a recursive loop.
I find itâs easier to flip through Manners, to cast your eyes about and wait for them to hook onto something muscular and twitchy.</description>

      <description>Regular readers of this column know that on the first Wednesday of every month, the Seattle Review of Books and the Seattle Weekly host a book club called Reading Through It at Third Place Books Seward Park. The response has been incredibly strong â anywhere between 60 and 100 attendees every month âÂ because books are the perfect response to the historical moment.
It just makes sense that in a time when too many voters are low-information or low-empathy, we should turn to books for help.</description>

      <description>Faith Erin Hicks debuts her new comic The Stone Heart at Elliott Bay Book Company in conversation with G. Willow Wilson. They&amp;#39;re getting deeply, delightfully nerdy right now.

I&amp;rsquo;ve attended a lot of author events that have been billed as the author appearing &amp;ldquo;in conversation with&amp;rdquo; an interviewer. But those events are never actually conversations; they&amp;rsquo;re just interviews.</description>

      <description>Bellingham poet Robert Lashley is probably best known for his stage presence. Lashley comes from the spoken word scene, and he is one of the best readers in the region: thereâs a moment in every one of his performances when he shifts from mild-mannered stage patter to the poet with that voice, and itâs always a bracing moment.
You can always tell when someone in the audience has never attended a Lashley reading before because they rear up when that voice makes itself known.</description>

      <description>We think of books not as commodities but as symbols of individuality. But centuries before the Industrial Revolution, printing presses were mass-producing books. In fact, books are the first item that we mass-produced as a species, and weâve gotten really good at making sure that every copy of a specific book is exactly the same as every other copy.
Part of the reason Jeff Bezos chose books as the commodity on which to establish his online retailing venture was the fact that books, as products, are so uniform.</description>

      <description>When the doctor holds my upper arm in his two hands,
he bows his head and listens as if he were waiting to hear
the song of a rare endemic bird no one has seen for centuries.
I start to speak, but he shakes his head, does not loosen his grip
on my arm, turns his fingers around the curve
of my skin and listens again.
I am afraid to clear my throat.</description>

      <description>Every year, the Hugo Awards announcement arrives with some dumb intercenine politics. Every year a small number of alt-right self-publishers try to game the ballot. Every year, they lose the awards. Every year, people call for the Hugos to change the way nominees are chosen. Every year the Hugos don&amp;rsquo;t really change a thing.
This year, there are fewer of the alt-right on the nominee slate, but they&amp;rsquo;re still there. Let&amp;rsquo;s not let those jackasses obscure the fact that some great books are on this list, including Charlie Jane Anders&amp;rsquo;s terrific debut novel All the Birds in the Sky.</description>

Sponsor Eric Andrews-Katz&#39;s newly released novel Tartarus is a great romp through time, mythology, epic battles, and gay romance. Two siblings, descendants of Olympus, are dragged into ancient battles they didn&#39;t know they were responsible for.
It&amp;rsquo;s a bold, entertaining work with an engaging story that bridges the old and the very new. We&amp;rsquo;ve got a full chapter on our Sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page for you to read, and find yourself gripped by this story.</description>

      <description>Bruja is the Spanish word for witch, and itâs possible that the witch in Wendy C. Ortizâs latest book is Wendy herself. Not only does Ortiz watch a cheetah chasing a possum through a window, she manages to catch a bear whispering into the ear of another bear, and she is present while a sea turtle turns into a seal. She survives several shark attacks, jumps into a car that flies over rooftops, has an affair with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and attempts to murder her mother.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend, some comments made at a sales conference by Marvel Comics&amp;rsquo;s Senior VP of Sales, David Gabriel, set the internet on fire. Gabriel was referring to a recent sales slump for Marvel books, and he seemed to place the entire blame for the slump on Marvel&amp;rsquo;s attempts at diversity:
What we heard was that **people didnât want any more diversity. They didnât want female characters out there**. Thatâs what we heard, whether we believe that or not.</description>

      <description>Colleen Louise Barry publishes weird and wonderful books under the name Mount Analogue. Itâs not just the name of her press so much as a pseudonym; the names âMount Analogueâ and âColleen Louise Barryâ are basically synonymous, the way âNine Inch Nailsâ and âTrent Reznorâ can be swapped out interchangeably.

Her books have a small print run and, externally, a minimalistic aesthetic. (Barry cites low-impact press Publication Studio as an inspiration for Mount Analogueâs look.</description>

      <description>Hugo House published an important call to action on their Facebook page:  More vital arts funding is in jeopardy here in Washington State and we need your help. Hugo House was recommended for a grant of over $1M through Washington State&#39;s Building for the Arts program. We recently learned that the Senate capital budget did not include funding for all of the groups recommended for supportâHugo House was right below the cutoff line.</description>

Dear Cienna,
What do you think about posthumously releasing books that authors didnât want us to see? On the one hand, you get unnecessary books like Nabokovâs *The Original of Laura*, and on the other, thereâs Kafkaâs entire oeuvre.</description>

      <description>The King County Library System dropped a press release yesterday when nobody was looking. Here&amp;rsquo;s the relevant passage:
Gary Wasdin, director of the King County Library System (KCLS) since January 2015, has resigned.
âKCLS is committed to providing a welcoming environment for all of its users,â said Jim Wigfall, KCLS Board President. âWhen it came to our attention that Mr. Wasdin violated KCLSâ code of conduct, the Board took immediate action.</description>

      <description>When you watch a movie, youâre handing over a remarkable amount of control over to the artists who made the film: the movie starts, the narrative unspools at its own pace, and then itâs over. You canât really get through a movieâs story any quicker than its director intended without fast-forwarding or skipping or taking some other drastic action that breaks the art.
Conversely, when you read a book the author has virtually no control over the time that the story takes in your mind.</description>

      <description>**Wednesday March 29th: The State of Arts Criticism in Seattle **
Doug McLennan, the founder of Arts Journal, talks with a panel of local critics including theater critic Misha Berson, the *Seattle Times*âs Brendan Kiley, former Seattle Weekly editor David Brewster, and, uh, me. Weâll be discussing why art criticism is being cut from local papers and why itâs currently in the hands of mostly middle aged white people. Folio: The Seattle Athenaem, 324 Marion St.</description>

      <description>The Artist Trust Grants for Artist Projects (also known as &amp;ldquo;GAP grants,&amp;rdquo; even though the &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;GAP&amp;rdquo; already stands for &amp;ldquo;grants&amp;rdquo;) opened for applications yesterday. These are &amp;ldquo;for artist-generated projects, which can include (but are not limited to) the development, completion or presentation of new work in any discipline.&amp;rdquo; That means if you have a project you&amp;rsquo;ve been dreaming of doing, Artist Trust wants to give you $1500 dollars to do it.</description>

Maybe youâve never been to an APRIL Festival before. Maybe youâre new to town. Maybe it just didnât sound like your thing âÂ maybe you donât like bars, or maybe youâre nervous about going to readings. Thatâs okay. Iâm not going to slather you with wistful sentimentality talking about what APRIL â the name stands for Authors, Publishers, and Readers of Indepdenent Literature â has meant to the city, or what itâs meant to me, in its five years as a literary festival in Seattle.</description>

      <description>Neil Gaiman&amp;rsquo;s sold-out reading at Benaroya Hall is this Sunday. Over at the San Diego Tribune, he talks about his new book, Norse Mythology, which retells Norse myths in more modern prose. Here he talks about a story in which the leader of the gods leads a crusade against foreigners:
I remember being in New York the other day and reading it in the town hall and when I got to the point where Odin says, â**Weâre going to build a wall**,â the entire hall erupted.</description>

All I&amp;rsquo;m saying is this: if you&amp;rsquo;re on a budget, and you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about hitting the bars on a weeknight this week, maybe stay home and invest in some literature this weekend.</description>

      <description>I like a little violence
in my poetry
because I donât trust
the sweetness
of too-ripe words, like
I donât trust a man
who says, âyouâre wonderfulâ
too quickly.
What would he say
if I told him the sugar
on his tongue
is only what I allow him
to taste?
I used to preen
when a lover called me
easygoing, as if
being no trouble at all
was some kind of glory,</description>

Sponsor Steve Toutonghi&#39;s debut novel _Join_ has just come out in paperback. It&#39;s the rarest of SF novels: a gripping concept delivered with compelling page-turning intensity. In the world of the novel, many people can join minds to become a single person. We&#39;ve got the first full chapter on our sponsor&#39;s page, so you can see how Toutonghi deftly weaves this high-concept idea into a great story.
The story follows Chance, a person made of many other people, all living seamlessly as a single entity.</description>

Trump the Destroyer Olivia Nuzzi published a long and detailed profile of Kellyanne Conway this week. It&amp;#8217;s a can&amp;#8217;t-look-away article, somewhere between trainwreck and victory march. (Side note: Like a lot of other people, I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure I could manage to dislike Conway in person.</description>

Oh, those blinking sentinels. I guess I could have written this about the towers on top of Queen Anne, but there&#39;s something about the way these three sisters are clustered together atop Capitol Hill, just off Madison, straddling 17th, two on the West, one to the East.</description>

Beale is currently trolling sci-fi superstar John Scalzi by publishing a book with a very similar title and cover to Scalzi&amp;rsquo;s new novel, The Collapsing Empire.</description>

      <description>This morning, Capitol Hill Seattle&amp;rsquo;s Kaylee Osowski reported that the Elliott Bay Book Company&amp;rsquo;s building has found a buyer. According to present Elliott Bay landlord Hunters Capital, the new landlord wants to keep the bookstore as a tenant. They have not yet revealed the identity of the prospective owner, but they call them &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;family-owned.&amp;rdquo;
We have every reason to believe those claims: Elliott Bay has a long-term lease for the space, and Hunters Capital specifically sought them out as tenants back when the store was based in Pioneer Square.</description>

Michael DeForgeâs new book Sticks Angelica, Folk Hero begins with all the elements of a classic comic strip. Youâve got the flawed main character, Sticks Angelica, a know-it-all chatterbox who, feeling underappreciated by society, moves to the wilderness to be alone. She fancies herself a survivalist: âI run twenty kilometres every morning. On days I donât bathe, I rub flowers on my armpits.â And she claims to live the life of a folk hero, wrestling bears when sheâs bored and devising homeopathic cures for hangnails.</description>

      <description>She hurt a manâs ego and there was a war and terrible carnage.
This is Sayantani Dasgupta&amp;rsquo;s nutshell recap of the Hindu story of Draupadi, a girl made of fire, in her book of essays Fire Girl: Essays of India, America, and the In-Between. Draupadi, considered a feminist icon, didn&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to speak her mind, so the miffed male unleashed the forces at his disposal and pretty much wrecked the world.</description>

ORIGINAL POST 9:59 AM: When Mia Lipman moved to Seattle from San Francisco in 2011, she was delighted to find that our city had an âactive, supportive literary scene.â But no matter how hard she looked, she couldnât find her favorite kind of reading: the dive bar cabaret, combining readings with stand-up comedy and musical performances.</description>

      <title>Hugo House and Seattle Public Library speak up about the state of ZAPP&#39;s zine library</title>

      <description>Tree Swenson, the executive director at Hugo House, wants to make it clear that the Zine Archive and Publishing Project library was not sold to the Seattle Public Library. She notes that ZAPP managing director Graham Isaac amended ZAPPâs original statement to reflect that fact. Not only that, Swenson adds, but âwe havenât signed anything with the library. Thereâs nothing that has been signed.â
Stepping back a bit: ZAPP was founded 21 years ago in the Hugo Houseâs basement.</description>

      <description>Just got an email from the Zine Archive and Publishing Project&amp;rsquo;s Managing Director, Graham Isaac regarding ZAPP&amp;rsquo;s closure. It&amp;rsquo;s billed as an &amp;ldquo;Official PR statement.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;re reprinting the statement in its entirety, using their bolds. There has been one update to the statement, which I detail below in an update on this post.
**Effective immediately Seattle Public Library will be taking over storage, programming, and access to ZAPP&#39;s collection of over 30,000 zines.</description>

      <description>Judge Neil Gorsuch, in his Supreme Court nomination hearings today, quoted David Foster Wallace&amp;rsquo;s most famous commencement speech to explain the ubiquity of law. (It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a dumb and basic interpretation of the speech, if you ask me, but whatever.) Justice Antonin Scalia was also a DFW fan. What&amp;rsquo;s the connection between conservative judges and the work of David Foster Wallace? It must the tennis, right? Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s gotta be the tennis.</description>

      <description>Cartoonists donât often get a chance at second acts. We expect comics artists to keep drawing the same immortal characters over and over until they grow old and die, like Charles Schulz; or until they retire from the business, like Gary Larson; or until they perfect their art and ascend to the literary heavens, like Lynda Barry.
Tacoma cartoonist Peter Bagge, then, is the great exception. His semi-autobiographical Buddy Bradley comics âÂ partially canonized last year in the deluxe two-volume reprint collection The Complete Neat Stuff â is largely considered one of the cornerstones of 1990s alternative comics.</description>

      <description>Just because I can now trap a spider
between cup and paper and set it free
doesnât mean Iâm no longer afraid.
Just because I sometimes believe
in the divine doesnât mean I donât see emptiness every time I close my eyes.
The man down the street
has made a home out of things
Iâve thrown out:
used retail bags, duck-taped and stretched, keep the rain at bay, old clothes</description>

Just got an email from ZAPP, the Zine Archive and Publishing Project, that the organization is finally folding.
The zine collection will be in good hands, at the CEN branch of Seattle Public Library.
The independent nonprofit called ZAPP will cease programming and has found worthy places to donate their remaining budget.</description>

Our sponsor, Friends&#39; of the UW Libraries, gala event &#34;Literary Voices&#34;, on May 3rd, is one of those amazing, inspiring events that are too far and too few between on our literary calendars. This year, they&#39;ve got a keynote address by the inimitable Annie Proulx, author of _The Shipping News_, _Barkskins_, and the short story &#34;Brokeback Mountain&#34;. The event is a fundraiser that pays directly for student employee scholarships. You are either helping to create the librarians of tomorrow, or get the librarians of today the support they need to run one of the most robust, impressive University library systems on the West Coast.</description>

Once in a while, I take a new book with me to lunch and give it a half an hour or so to grab my attention. **Lunch Date** is my judgment on that speed-dating experience.
**Whoâs your date today?** *Him, Me, Muhammad Ali*, by Randa Jarrar.
**Whereâd you go?** The [Chaco Canyon Organic CafÃ©](http://www.chacocanyoncafe.com/about-us/) in West Seattle.
**Whatâd you eat?** I had the smoky yam and kale quinoa bowl($9.95) and a cup of coffee.</description>

      <description>One day, Jamaica Baldwinâs name just started popping up everywhere in Seattle literary circles. Two years ago, I had never seen her name before. Then from out of the blue in January of 2016 came this tweet from Kwame Dawes:
Remember this name: JAMAICA BALDWIN. A poet of power will cross your path soon.
&amp;mdash; Kwame Dawes (@kwamedawes) January 8, 2016 And then Baldwin was everywhere at once. She was part of the exclusive Margin Shift poetry collectiveâs reading series and the 2016 Lit Crawl and seemingly everywhere else in the Seattle literary scene.</description>

The Fate of the Critic in the Clickbait Age This one&amp;#8217;s close to home. Arts culture and reviews are on the decline as news publications go digital-first â criticism just doesn&amp;#8217;t drive the clicks and pageviews that are the darlings of the modern editorial office.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re very sad to share the news that Edmonds poet Joan Swift passed away on March 13th. She was 90 years old. We&amp;rsquo;ll share details of the memorial as soon as we hear them.
If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with Swift, I would encourage you to read this interview between Tania Pryputniewicz and Swift, which frankly covers topics including Swift&amp;rsquo;s history of sexual abuse, and how her strength informs her work. She also offers her advice to young women who write, and discusses her time as a student of Northwestern poetry cornerstone Theodore Roethke.</description>

      <description>Mary Gaitskill discussing her career as a bookseller. This is the first @hugohouse reading at Washington Hall, which is a great reading venue!
A post shared by The Seatttle Review of Books (@seattlereviewof) on Mar 16, 2017 at 7:30pm PDT
 Last night, Mary Gaitskill delivered a craft talk at a Hugo House event hosted at Washington Hall. Gaitskill was mostly interested in the intangible elements of writing: that mysterious intangible known as &amp;ldquo;style&amp;rdquo; which creeeps in around the words and imbues the text with a meaning that is greater than the sum of its parts.</description>

Dear Cienna,
In your opinion, what movie adaptation is better than the book itâs based on and why?
Caroline, Matthews Beach
Dear Caroline,
I&#39;m currently loving *Black Sails*, which is not a movie but a pirate-themed series based on historical figures and characters from the children&#39;s book *Treasure Island*.</description>

Mohsin Hamid writes novels about the world as it is now. His books are structurally adventurous and tuned to provocative issues like immigration, racism, and the War on Terror. His latest novel is about a young couple finding love in a world overrun with homeless refugees and fearful xenophobes.</description>

Can and canât Many people say you canât teach anyone to write. Just Google the phrase âCanât teach how to write.â Half your hits will be refutations of the idea &amp;mdash; which means half those discussing it think it needs refuting. Creative writing programs proliferate across the country, around the world, and all through the virtual ether &amp;mdash; and yet theyâre slammed by pros as too academic, too expensive, for dilettantes, for cowards, a scam to employ lazy and/or inept has-beens as teachers and enrich institutions catering to the dimwit dreams of talentless wannabes.</description>

      <description>Every so often I&amp;rsquo;ll read a corporate superhero comic that reminds me why I fell in love with the genre as a child. This week&amp;rsquo;s U.S.Avengers #4 is that kind of a book.
Writer Al Ewing has been pubilshing fun superhero comics for Marvel for a while â his Ultimates has basically grown into a hall-of-fame of the weirdest ideas Marvel writers have ever produced â but his U.S.Avengers series is the best thing he&amp;rsquo;s done yet.</description>

      <description>You can choose from any number of reasons to attend the Gramma Poetry launch party at Canvas (the space formerly known as Western Bridge) this Friday night. Itâs the launch party for an exciting new Seattle publisher called Gramma Poetry. Thereâs food. Thereâs booze. People are spreading rumors that there may be a bouncy castle. The band Boyfriends will play a set, followed by a dance party. Gramma author Christine Shan Shan Hou will be signing copies of her new book Community Garden for Lonely Girls.</description>

Every time you purchase an audiobook through Libro.fm, you support the indie bookstore of your choice. (Local bookstore participants in the program include Eagle Harbor Book Company, Edmonds Bookshop, the Elliott Bay Book Company, Island Books, Liberty Bay Books, Phinney Books, Third Place Books, University Book Store, and Village Books.</description>

      <description>Itâs hard to remain human
on a day when mercy is a frozen river,
when the news informs me tomorrowâs
as bleak as it was yesterday, tells me
yesterday couldn&amp;rsquo;t have left love
lingering listlessly on my bed all eager
hands and doe-eyed, says
thereâs no room for beauty in this fight.
Liberals tell me, we must remain
vigilant. We canât rest, relax,
let down our guard, but
donât they know Iâve been vigilant</description>

The UW Libraries&#39; &#34;Literary Voices&#34; celebration is a great event on May 3rd âÂ a dinner where every table is filled with local authors, and the amazing Annie Proulx, author of _The Shipping News_, _Barkskins_, and the short story &#34;Brokeback Mountain&#34;, will be delivering the keynote.
Best of all, it&amp;rsquo;s a fundraiser, so your money goes directly into paying for student employee scholarships. As any library nerd knows, UW&amp;rsquo;s library system is vast, comprehensive, and unparalleled.</description>

      <description>Eventually weâll get to the stars, but first we have to walk.
 I do not like to run. Iâll sprint for a bus now and again, but the rhythm of jogging, the enthusiastic bouncing, has always felt artificial to me.
Instead, I prefer to walk. Not jaunts to the corner store or after-dinner strolls through the neighborhood. I can walk a marathon every Saturday â in fact, I basically require it.</description>

      <description>I first met Stephanie Han in Los Angeles in 1998 when we were chosen as fellows in a new literary mentorship program, PENâs Emerging Voices. Looking back, we were both arrogant in the way of young untested writers, but at least Stephanie could back up her attitude. She was well-read and discerning about literature. During one workshop, she explained the Shakespearean allusions in the manuscript up for review; allusions that everyone else had missed.</description>

My Life as a Hemophobe Isabella Rotman&amp;#8217;s short comic about what it&amp;#8217;s like to faint at the sight of blood is a stellar mix of styles â existential, autobiographical, and educational all at once.</description>

      <description>Well, this is pretty cool:
...Vancouver-based studio Bit Byterz have chosen to pay elaborate tribute to Murakami by recreating his uncanny world with an adventure game called *Memoranda*... While not a direct adaptation of any one work of Murakamiâs in particular, its locations, its characters, and above all its atmosphere come drawn from the same â to use a highly appropriate metaphor â well.  </description>

You&amp;rsquo;ve likely read something in the last month about Emil Ferris&amp;rsquo;s stellar graphic novel My Favorite Thing Is Monsters, which was just published by Fantagraphics Books. NPR&amp;rsquo;s John Powers explains the story of how Ferris came to create the book:
 She was a 40-year-old single mom who supported herself doing illustrations when she was bitten by a mosquito, she contracted West Nile virus, became paralyzed from the waist down, and lost the use of her drawing hand.</description>

      <description>**Wednesday March 8th: *Native Seattle* Reading**
Coll Thrush, a professor at the University of British Columbia, has two new books out. The first, *Indigenous London*, looks pretty neat. But weâre most interested in the new edition of *Native Seattle*, his history of Seattleâs native peoples. Today, Crosscutâs Knute Berger will interview Thrush about both books. *Folio: The Seattle Athenaem, 324 Marion St., 402-4612, http://folioseattle.org. $10. 7 p.m.* ![](/webhook-uploads/1488582134310/toughgirl.jpeg)

      <description>Kevin Craft is one of the hardest-working people in Seattle literature. As a teacher, he works on literary programs at Everett Community College and University of Washington. As an editor, he ran Poetry Northwest magazine for seven years and has compiled five anthologies. As a publisher he just built a new press, Poetry Northwest Editions, that will launch with a new collection from Sierra Nelson this year. And as a writer, heâs.</description>

      <description>It seems that nearly every page of Seattle author Kevin Emersonâs young adult science fiction novel Last Day on Mars has a blinking light on it. Since the book takes place on a Mars colony in the far-flung year of 2213, most of the lights are on console panels or spacefaring equipment. There are some signal lights, too, and a few twinkling stars. But the book is really about one giant blinking light: the sun, billions of years ahead of schedule, is about to go supernova and then collapse, rendering our solar system inhospitable.</description>

The branch in question, of course, is the The Douglass-Truth Library.

      <description>My father was de-boned as a child.
The trick was to use a sharp knife,
steady hands and always begin at the neck. With luck, my grandparents
were able to remove his spine intact.
But all-muscle canât hold love upright.
You see strength needs something
to settle itself around. Boneless men
can only stay where they are bent to.
My father was made to cut
his own beatings off a tree,</description>

Thanks to our Puppet-in-Chief, everyone&amp;rsquo;s talking about Russia these days. But how much do you actually know about Russia? How much of what you know is just left over from the old Cold War frame of thinking?
This coming Saturday at 6 pm, Fantagraphics Books, University of Washington, and Short Run are bringing Russian cartoonist/journalist Victoria Lomasko to the Fantagraphics Bookstore and Gallery in Georgetown. Lomasko will be presenting from and signing her new book of journalism, Other Russias.</description>

On his blog, The View from Nathanâs Bus, he writes candidly about what he sees as a driver on the 7 line through Rainier Valley, which is commonly stereotyped as the cityâs most infamous route.
Operating a bus gives you a front row seat to the very best and worst of humanity.</description>

Three Iconic Musicians on Artistic Creation â and Its Importance Now Wyatt Mason&amp;#8217;s humility lifts this interview with Kendrick Lamar, Beck, and Tom Waits beyond its style-magazine setting. Maybe because Mason asks &amp;#8220;some stupid questions,&amp;#8221; each of the three musicians responds directly and unpretentiously, offering up their take on songwriting and the relationship between music and the world in times of crisis.</description>

Located in the Writer&amp;rsquo;s Block, it&amp;rsquo;s staffed by local librarians &amp;mdash; thirty-five of them from twelve library systems! &amp;mdash; who are there for reading recommendations, and also research advice for content creators. There&amp;rsquo;s a chill area where you can get away from the bustle for a few minutes to check out what they have on their shelves.
And if you&amp;rsquo;re creator, one of the organizers has put out a call for you to come by and be a volunteer for an hour or so.</description>

An Eastern Kentucky police chief has removed large decals with the Punisher skull and âBlue Lives Matterâ from eight police cars after a backlash following the publication of a Herald-Leader story.
The Catlettsburg Police department, which employs eight full-time and two part-time officers for a population of about 2,500, featured the images on the hoods of its 2013 and 2017Â Ford InterceptorÂ sedans and sport-utility vehicles, assistant police chief Gerry Hatzel said.</description>

      <description>Itâs not often that I find an epiphany in a book. Sure, books deepen my understanding and broaden my perspective, but an out-and-out epiphany? A miraculous moment in which the fog clears and my vision focuses on something new? Thatâs a rare thing. Arlie Russell Hochschildâs Strangers in Their Own Land delivered such a new insight to me, and itâs on a topic Iâve been batting around in my head for months âÂ maybe years.</description>

      <description>For years, Amazon has offered commissions to book bloggers who link to books on Amazon. In other words, if you were reading a review on a blog and you clicked the link on the blog to buy that book on Amazon, you&amp;rsquo;d be sending a small amount of money the bloggers&amp;rsquo; way. It&amp;rsquo;s called the affiliate program. Some book blogs have grown to depend on affiliate revenue over the years, and Amazon relied on affiliates to serve, effectively, as handsellers for the company.</description>

This edition focuses on Arlie Russell Hochschildâs Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right.

      <description>We told you last night that the bidding war for memoirs from Barack and Michelle Obama reached $60 million. Last night, Penguin Random House announced that they won the rights to publish the books. They&amp;rsquo;re expected to arrive in 2018. Penguin Random House&amp;rsquo;s CEO promises to &amp;ldquo;make each of their books global publishing events of unprecedented scope and significance.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>With Emerald City Comicon landing at the Convention Center, all of Seattle is suffering from a ferocious case of nerd fever this weekend. But if you canât make it to the show, you shouldnât feel as though youâre missing out on the fun. In fact, the after-parties and side events â all of which are open to the public, even those who donât have an ECCC lanyard â look to be more exciting than the main event.</description>

      <description>John Williams at the New York Times writes:
Patti Hartigan, a former theater critic for the *Boston Globe*, has been signed to write the first major biography of August Wilson, the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and one of the most significant voices in 20th-century American literature. 37 INK, an imprint at Atria Books, plans to publish the book, tentatively titled âAugust Wilson: The Kiln in Which He Was Fired,â in late 2019.</description>

      <description>Australian comic and TV writer Tom Taylor announced last night on Facebook that he&amp;rsquo;s not going to attend Emerald City Comicon this week in Seattle. In fact, he&amp;rsquo;s not coming to the United States at all this year. Why? Well, I&amp;rsquo;ll let him speak for himself:
...America, through no fault of most of its citizens, doesnât feel like a safe or welcoming travel destination at this moment.
There have been reports of interrogation, phone data downloads, requests for social media accounts, returns and five-year travel bans and everyone from children to the elderly being detained.</description>

Sponsor Sagging Meniscus is back to show a remarkable work by Stephen Moles, called _The Most Wretched Thing Imaginable_. We&#39;ve got a nice sample of his sparkling prose on our sponsor&#39;s page, but there&#39;s also two videos of Moles reading from the work, as an added treat.
Read about how Moles got started in this work by translating the song of birds into messages, and how it all relates to his Dark Meaning Research Institute.</description>

      <description>A piece for the Millions titled &amp;ldquo;Against Readability&amp;rdquo; by Harvard College Writing Program professor Ben Roth has been circling the lit-o-sphere this week. It&amp;rsquo;s a classic finger-wagging routine about serious literature from an establishment male:
âReadableâ has become the chosen term of praise in our times precisely because so many of us find ourselves unable to concentrate as we once could or still aspire to. But to praise readability is to embrace the vicious feedback loop that our culture now finds itself in.</description>

As you know, developers are right now constructing a fancy new building where Hugo House once stood, and Hugo House will have a home in that building. And the House is in the running for a state grant to pay for their new home.</description>

En route to Milwaukee for a conference on February 9, where she was to deliver the opening keynote address at a literacy conference, Fox was ushered into an airport holding room and told she was travelling on the wrong visa. This was incorrect and the US Embassy in Canberra has since apologised.</description>

      <description>Like everyone else, you probably grew a little bit misty at the news that NASA discovered seven Earth-sized planets some 40 light years away from us. It&amp;rsquo;s wondrous news, by which I mean it inspires wonder in us.
But one of the neater and under-covered aspects of this revelation is that astronomer Sean Raymond, one of the co-authors of the report about the planets, announced the discovery with a long poem.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;ve tried to order Zaher&amp;rsquo;s new book online, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed that it&amp;rsquo;s not available. I talked with Chatwin/Arundel owner Phil Bevis about why that is. Basically, Arundel Books had to suddenly move their store to a newer, more favorable location.</description>

      <description>The eighth issue of Nick Spencer and Steve Lieber&amp;rsquo;s crime comic The Fix was published yesterday, and this series keeps getting better. Ostensibly the story of two crooked Los Angeles cops and a drug-sniffing dog named Pretzels, The Fix keeps expanding to absorb more and more characters; what began as a character-focused heist story quickly (and effortlessly) became a huge ensemble piece.

Note those words: &amp;ldquo;expanding,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;huge.&amp;rdquo; This isn&amp;rsquo;t the vocabulary you usually use to describe an Elmore Leonard riff.</description>

Wednesday February 22nd: The Burning World Reading
Hardcore zombie purists may not love Isaac Marion&amp;rsquo;s young adult novel Warm Bodies â zombies who can talk? Sacrilege! â but everyone else seems to have fallen pretty hard. In the new sequel, the semi-alive protagonist learns how to reconnect with the human race and come to terms with his past. Bellevue Library, 1111, 110th Ave, 425-450-1765, http://kcls.org. All ages. 7 p.m.</description>

Seems impossible in 2017, but you can still find people online who proudly announce that they donât listen to ârap-crap.â Likewise, plenty of dudes will eagerly announce that they like all kinds of music except for country and hip-hop. Those are both statements that carry a lot of unspoken weight: if you dismiss country music and hip-hop with one broad shrug, you are basically saying âpoor people make me uncomfortable and I prize comfort over everything else, including intellectual curiosity.</description>

Well, you rendered [Northwest Associated Arts&#39;](http://nwassociatedarts.org/) sponsorship useless by buying all the tickets to their Neil Gaiman event, so they kindly donated this week&#39;s sponsorship to a good cause: [Gay City](https://www.gaycity.org).
Did you know that Gay City has a 7,000 volume library centered around LGBT interest and focus? Please consider donating to Gay City to support their important mandate for supporting LGBT culture and health in our city.

      <description>There comes a time in every poetâs life when they must set aside their lofty goals and get on down to the pressing business of fucking. Iâm not talking about flowery love poems âÂ I mean the kind of horny writing that drops all metaphor and imagery and makes it clear that genital-to-genital contact is about to happen.
The poems in the beginning of Maged Zaherâs new collection, Opting Out: Early, New &amp;amp; Collected Poems 2000 â 2015, are about as thirsty as poems can get.</description>

come to us again
Bacon and egg smells
float over from Master&amp;rsquo;s House
somebody&amp;rsquo;s smoking cigars
maybe two somebodies
Cigars they come here
by big riverboats
breakfast china dishes
they come too
and ice for fancy get-togethers
Cost lots of money

      <description>So it turns out that Simon &amp;amp; Schuster&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;free speech&amp;rdquo; defense of Yiannopoulos was total bullshit. When people complained about Yiannopoulos&amp;rsquo;s racism and sexim, Simon &amp;amp; Schuster was high on the free speech horse. But now that video has emerged of Yiannopoulos exercising his free speech about pedophilia, Simon &amp;amp; Schuster runs away.
In other words, it was only when Yiannopoulos started spouting unmarketable speech that Simon &amp;amp; Schuster got queasy.</description>

Two University of Washington professors are teaching a course to help students âthink critically about the data and models that constitute evidence in the social and natural sciences,â according to the introduction to the course.
The 160-seat seminar, titled âCalling Bullshit in the Age of Big Data,â begins in late March and continues for roughly 10 weeks. Members of the general public can follow the course syllabus, including readings and recordings of lectures, at the courseâs website.</description>

Dear Cienna,
As a bookseller, I was jealous of [the San Francisco bookstore that refused to carry or order Milo Yiannopoulosâs book for customers](http://sfist.com/2017/01/11/milo_yiannopoulos_booksmith_simon_s.php). My bookstore wonât do the same, no matter how hard my coworkers and I plead to the owners.</description>

      <description>Hugo House management plans the themes for their Literary Series events months in advance. They have to give the participating three writers and one musical act plenty of time to come up with new work incorporating their prompts. So itâs not like the theme of this Fridayâs Literary Series event, âExile,â was chosen as a response to the chaos unleashed by President Trumpâs Muslim ban. Itâs just â well, âa happy accidentâ isnât the right term, obviously.</description>

The hugely successful fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials will be getting a &#34;companion&#34; trilogy, author Philip Pullman announced this evening.
The first book of the new series, which will collectively be called The Book of Dust, is set for publication on October 19.

After Donald Trumpâs inauguration, a number of self-described ârogueâ accounts started popping up on Twitter: @RoguePOTUSStaff, @RogueNASA, @AltNatParkSer. They all supposedly were accounts run by government employees who are outraged by the Trump administration. This quickly became a fad, as demonstrated by a Twitter list of dozens of such accounts.
In this age when Republicans immediately label any news that they dislike as âfake news,â and when Democrats complain loudly about the conservative social media bubble, I find it infuriating that liberals are religiously retweeting anything these so-called âRogueâ accounts post.</description>

      <description>To celebrate the paperback release of his excellent novel Lovecraft Country, Seattle author Matt Ruff is doing an AMA (that stands for &amp;ldquo;Ask Me Anything&amp;rdquo;) on Reddit right now. (And if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for inspiration for things to ask him, here&amp;rsquo;s my interview with Ruff from his book launch party last year.)</description>

We&#39;re so excited to have Matthew Amster-Burton as our sponsor this week. His new novel _Our Secret Better Lives_ is a funny, stirring, and exciting tale. Set in 1994, it&#39;s about Katy, a huge music fan on a big adventure to a new state and college, who finds herself doing one thing she never imagined: stepping in front of a microphone in a new band.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got a full chapter, and more information, on our sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page so you can see just how deftly Matthew handles these engaging characters.</description>

      <description>Paul Auster reading at @town_hall_seattle tonight. Part of the q&amp;amp;a dealt with Auster&amp;#39;s work with @pen_america: he offered the thought that, in authoritarian regimes, the &amp;#34;act of novel-writing enforces democracy&amp;#34;. Astonishing that that insight now applies in the United States. #paulauster #townhallseattle #bookreading #author #books #novel #reading #makeamericareadagain #dumptrump #glisteningocherousamoeba @faberbooks @henryholtbooks

      <description>Doris Lessingâs library: a life in 4,000 books To an incurable book snoop, this seems like the opportunity of a lifetime: Nick Holdstock was given free access to Doris Lessing&amp;#8217;s books in order to inventory them after her death. It&amp;#8217;s a massive project (Lessing&amp;#8217;s collection, Holdstock says, &amp;#8220;seemed untouched by what Walter Benjamin called &amp;#8216;the mild boredom of order&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;), to which he brings a storyteller&amp;#8217;s eye, tracking Lessing&amp;#8217;s studies, her eccentricities, and her ongoing conversation with the books she loved.</description>

  Standing on the northeast corner of Third and Stewart, looking south on Third, one sees a sky bridge. It connects a parking garage to the building that once housed The Bon MarchÃ©, one of three powerhouse retailers that bounded out of the wellspring of Seattle in the olden days.</description>

They&amp;rsquo;re doing us proud!
Unfortunately, AWP management doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be rising to the occasion. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen several Facebook posts complaining about a failure to provide accessibility for the disabled, particularly with power doors onsite at the Washington [DC] Convention Center that don&amp;rsquo;t open at the push of a button.</description>

Early in Sexcastle, a random goon threatens Shane Sexcastle by asking, &amp;ldquo;You ever hear the phrase &amp;lsquo;You brought a knife to a gun fight?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;
Sexcastle responds, &amp;ldquo;This is worse than that. You brought a you to a me fight.&amp;rdquo;
Sexcastle was first published almost two years ago, but it had escaped my attention until the good folks at Phoenix Comics turned me on to it last night. I was interested in an upcoming comic called Rock Candy Mountain about a hoboâs epic journey by a cartoonist named Kyle Starks, and they happened to have his first book in stock.</description>

Iâm Fine But You Appear to Be Sinking, by Leyna KrowÂ Hereâs the opening paragraph of Spokane writer Leyna Krowâs story âDisruption:â
Each morning, a man in Detroit, Michigan pushes a button and everything falls out of my kitchen shelves and onto my kitchen floor. It is unclear to me if this is the primary function of the button or if itâs simply an unintended consequence. Regardless, I find it to be an inconvenience.</description>

      <description>The thing about literature is that as one generation of giants fall, thereâs always another ready to take its place. The most recent winter of titans concluded when John Updike passed away and Philip Roth announced his retirement. Weâve got a young generation on the rise with Zadie Smith and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. But the generation now at the height of its power includes names like Don DeLillo and, most especially, Paul Auster.</description>

      <description>Novels are terrific engines of social change. No form of art is as effective at putting you inside the minds of other people; to read a novel, you must be willing and welcoming to someone elseâs perspectives. Being a receptive reader is a state of grace that you never experience in, say, politics. Itâs a place of possibility, an opportunity to create change in yourself. Harriet Beecher Stowe understood this, and Charles Dickens, and Harper Lee.</description>

      <title>Now Playing: James Baldwin&#39;s brilliance and heartbreak</title>

      <description>James Baldwin is at the center of the new documentary I Am Not Your Negro, but itâs not a biography. Instead, itâs an essay about the history of race in America composed posthumously from Baldwinâs notes. Baldwin is at the center of the film; itâs constructed around his narration (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) and his televised appearances serve as supplementary arguments. He shares his own story, but he only uses it as an example of the larger African-American experience.</description>

      <description>Even if the word âremainderâ doesnât mean anything to you, you likely have spent time browsing remaindered books. You can find remainders in most large bookstoresâtheyâre the new-looking books that sell for used-book prices, often stacked on tables near the front door. Theyâre basically the second-run movie theaters of the publishing worldâoutdated overstock sold for dirt-cheap to distributors a year or more after the title first went on sale.
Remainders â also called bargain books â are big business for bookstores.</description>

Using the word-mashing logic of SeaTac, we should have named the lake to our east SeaBelle. To the North, perhaps we could make a region called SeaEver, and perhaps our ferry runs could be SeaBain, SeaVash, and SeaBrem.</description>

      <description>Charlie Warzel at BuzzFeed:
As Amazon positions itself as an outspoken critic of President Donald Trumpâs immigration policies, inside the company, dozens of employees are voicing deep concern about another political issue: Amazonâs choice to advertise on Breitbart.com.
According to internal emails and documents obtained by BuzzFeed News, employees have begun voicing concerns about the companyâs advertising relationship with the provocative far-right website. Some piled on to a complaint ticket in Amazonâs internal issue escalation system urging the company to sever its relationship with Breitbart, the site that former editor and nowâSenior White House Advisor Steve Bannon once called âthe platform for the alt-right.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I dreamed that my passport was a book of prayers,&amp;rdquo; Sherman Alexie writes in his new poem &amp;ldquo;Autopsy&amp;rdquo; at Early Bird Books. &amp;ldquo;Autopsy&amp;rdquo; is a deeply political poem that was born from this political moment, like Elisa Chavez&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Revenge&amp;rdquo; and Claudia Castro Luna&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Am I not an immigrant?,&amp;rdquo; both of which were published right here on the Seattle Review of Books. It is incredibly heartening to see poets making something out of this despair, and to see the general public respond to these poems with such enthusiasm.</description>

      <description>I have written about how good the Flintstones comic is, but it has to be noted that the most recent issue, #8, is the best, most ambitious edition yet. It satirizes gender roles, economics, politics, and celebrity, and it also contains a great little story about how the ultimate goal of parenting should be to fuck the next generation up slightly less than your own.
My favorite part of the new issue is when a guest speaker named &amp;ldquo;Thorstone Pebblen&amp;rdquo; discusses &amp;ldquo;a brand-new field of research called &amp;lsquo;economics.</description>

      <description>You have to read Mary Ann Gwinn&amp;rsquo;s final column in her role as the Seattle Times books editor. It&amp;rsquo;s a grand and generous tour of the last 34 years in Seattle literary history. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to pull a single quote here, because you should read the whole thing. (Full disclosure: I choked up a little at the shoutout to the Seattle Review of Books.)
But before we get too somber, let&amp;rsquo;s note that Gwinn is not disappearing: she will contribute columns to the Times, she&amp;rsquo;s writing about books for other outlets, and she&amp;rsquo;ll continue to co-host Well Read on KCTS.</description>

      <description>Itâs easy to see why Rebecca Solnitâs book Hope in the Dark has become an independent bookstore bestseller in the months since Donald Trump won the election. After all, itâs a book written by one of our smartest cultural critics about finding hope in difficult political times. Readers know they can trust Solnit to not be too Pollyannaish in her conclusions about hope. Sheâs physically incapable of offering a bromide, or a clichÃ©, or an unsupported premise.</description>

      <description>If I had to choose one, and only one, writer to help me navigate the world for the rest of my life, my choice would probably be Rebecca Solnit. Solnit is a considerate, intelligent writer; sometimes when you read her essays you can feel your own brain changing and growing to accept new information about the world. And sheâs also got the power to direct the very flow of popular culture; her essay âMen Explain Things to Meâ is widely regarded as the source of the word âmansplaining.</description>

      <description>Nobody writes about the Northwest like Jon Raymond. From his gorgeous short storiesâ *Livability* is one of the finest books about the region to be published in the last two decades âto screenplays for films like *Old Joy* and *Wendy and Lucy* to novels like *Rain Dragon*, heâs perfected the art of writing about the lush vividness of Northwest nature, the peculiar mannerisms of Northwest people, and the sprawling wet-concrete grace of Northwestern cities.</description>

      <description>[A Yazidi refugee, stranded at the airport by Trump](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-yazidi-refugee-stranded-at-the-airport-by-trump) There are endless articles about this week&amp;rsquo;s executive order limiting refugee entry into the United States, and you should read as many of them as you can stomach, and then keep reading. Trust credible sources, understand the legal and social issues, keep your eyes open despite your exhaustion and grief.
Donald Trump has taken or promised many scary, ugly actions in his first week in office, but this is the first with immediate and brutal human impact.</description>

Ah, Kerry Park. As Seattle views go, it&#39;s hard to beat this one, and that&#39;s in a city with more vistas than West World. Have you ever been? It&#39;s crowded, nearly all the time (except, ironically, the day I dropped by to take these photos).</description>

      <description>We told you yesterday that the New York Times seems to be removing a number of categories from its popular bestseller list feature. Starting early in February, they won&amp;rsquo;t be publishing bestseller lists for graphic novels, mass market paperbacks, and certain lists for middle readers and young adults.
 This story has developed since then.
 Alexander Lu at Comics Beat asked the New York Times why this change was happening, and the Times responded that &amp;ldquo;the discontinued lists did not reach or resonate with many readers.</description>

Dear Cienna,
Everybody is always complaining about post-apocalyptic fiction, but just look at where we are now? Kind of prescient, arenât they?
Do you have any good recommendations for someone who&amp;rsquo;s gone through the most popular YA versions of the genre?</description>

      <description>Whenever I visit a person&amp;rsquo;s house, I immediately start checking out their bookshelves. Bookshelves are the best way to get a look into someone&amp;rsquo;s interior life. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why I find this tweet to be so upsetting:

      <description>John Jackson Miller at Comichron reports on some apparent upcoming changes to the New York Times&amp;rsquo;s bestseller list, including the deletion of the graphic novel bestsellers. He continues:
Following an early report, I communicated with a contact who receives an advance copy [of the list] who noted there are further changes, including the elimination of the mass-market paperback charts and the merger of the e-book-only list with the fiction list. Other categories are reduced in size; the adult trade fiction list goes from 15 entries to 10, while the highest-profile list, the hardcovers, is cut from 20 entries to 15.</description>

      <description>Jack Kirby&amp;rsquo;s Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth was my favorite childhood comic. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it was a ripoff of the first Planet of the Apes movie at the time I started reading my brother&amp;rsquo;s old issues. In fact, I probably started reading Kamandi a full decade before the first time I saw Planet of the Apes. And while I love the Apes reboot films, I still prefer Kamandi.</description>

      <description>At some point, you have to figure, Jon Raymond will get sick of people comparing him to Raymond Carver. In reviews, the Portland-based author is said to âevokeâ or hail âfrom the school ofâ Carver. Some reviewers even make the rare and fascinating observation that Raymondâs last name and Carverâs first name areÂ âÂ gasp â the EXACT SAME NAME. (Full disclosure, I very well may have made that Raymond-Carver comparison in past reviews; Iâm too embarrassed to Google myself and find out.</description>

      <description>Weâve been trained by popular culture to visualize serial killers in a very specific way: theyâre sleek, efficient, charming hunters of humans. Sociopathic and hyper-intelligent, serial killers are always five steps ahead of everyone else. Theyâre willful, clever, highly manipulative loners, and theyâre relentlessly driven by some lone traumatic incident in their childhood. Theyâre not so much human beings as puzzle-boxes to entertain and alarm us for a couple hours until theyâre finally captured and the closing credits roll.</description>

Texas representative Bill Flores, chair of the Republican Study Committee, has released a Blueprint for a Balanced Budget 2.0 (PDF) that lays out a Republican plan for austerity under the guise of fiscal responsibility. It&amp;rsquo;s a horrifying document, one that leaves the American people on their own while sustaining enormous military expenditures that amount to, by far, the largest defense budget on earth. So what gets cut? Programs that assist the poor, regulatory committes, and healthy school lunches (&amp;ldquo;funding for the National School Lunch Program standards should be prohibited, returning control of studentsâ diets to their parents.</description>

      <title>That Awkward Moment When He Says, âYouâre So Sweet,â And All I Can Think Is: âNah, Man. Iâm a Velociraptor.â</title>

      <description>Velociraptors and I have faces for the movies.
We have learned how to open doors: We scrape talons
across the knob, sneak out middle of the night
leave fading indent in the bed. He calls asking where I am.
Iâm in your blind spot.
Iâm watching heat radiate off you
as you stumble through the woods. I am attracted
to movement, meaning I only chase somethingÂ when it runs.
Like a velociraptor,Â I will not text you back.</description>

      <description>Carolyn Reidy, the CEO at Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, released a letter in response to the uproar that followed the news that a conservative imprint of S&amp;amp;S was publishing a book by white nationalist Milo Yiannopoulos. The response (published below) is several weeks too late and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually address the issues that many have raised about the deal.
Reidy assures readers that the book will not feature hate speech. This is, of course, beside the point.</description>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1485151275069/aclu.png)
_The Seattle Review of Books_ has donated our sponsorship slot this week to encourage our readers to donate to the [ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/secure/become-freedom-fighter-join-aclu?s_src=UNW170001C00&amp;alt_src=UNV170001C00&amp;ms=web_menu_join). Just the few first days of the Trump administration were enough to tell us that we&#39;re going to need as many hands on deck as possible to fight him.
That means lawsuits, and challenging him in court. That means the ACLU is going to be vital to American freedom in the years to come.</description>

      <description>Elisa Chavezâs poem [âRevengeâ](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/01/03/revenge/) was published on her Tumblr and then was republished by Seattle author Lesley Hazleton. We [read the poem on Hazletonâs blog](http://accidentaltheologist.com/?p=6059) and got permission from both Chavez and Hazleton to publish it on the *Seattle Review of Books*, and we made Chavez our very first Poet in Residence for the month of January. Then, the poem went absolutely nuts: this month, many tens of thousands of people have come to the *Seattle Review of Books* to read and share âRevengeâ with their social networks.</description>

      <description>Piecing together the Sunday Post is usually easy and a pleasure; in fact, it&amp;#8217;s an excuse and justification for the most idle pleasure possible: endless scrolling through the world of online content, mind half alert, fingers on autopilot.
But the Internet after the inauguration of our 45th president is no place for the idle or unalert. As much as Donald Trump has dominated the media, social and otherwise, since his presidential bid began, this week has been different.</description>

      <description>I keep asking myself: What sequence of events, in all human history, was stranger, more bizarre, more tragically ridiculous than this?
&amp;mdash; William Gibson (@GreatDismal) January 20, 2017 Things are getting weird. Yesterday, I noticed a certain panicked expression on the faces of commuters. People answered the question &amp;ldquo;how are you?&amp;rdquo; by averting their eyes and mumbling that they&amp;rsquo;re doing okay, considering everything. You know that moment when you suddenly realize that you&amp;rsquo;ve been clenching your jaw for the last 24 hours?</description>

      <description>Marcel Duchampâs great work, The Large Glass depicts an abstract scene. The full title: The Bride Stripped Bare by her Bachelors, Even. Itâs conceptual and heady: ââ¦nobody fully understands The Large Glassâ says Duchampâs biographer Calvin Tomkins.
Duchamp said it wasnât a painting, but a âdelayâ: âa delay in glass as you would say a poem in prose or a spittoon in silver,â he said. âThe Bride is basically a motor,â he said.</description>

**Looking for Betty MacDonald Reading**
Betty MacDonaldâs 1945 memoir about life on the Olympic Peninsula, *The Egg and I*, is an underappreciated Northwest classic. Seattle-area historian Paula Becker celebrates the UW Pressâs republication of three long out-of-print books by MacDonald with a reading from her book which celebrates MacDonaldâs history and legacy.</description>

      <description>Not everyone realizes this, but every single comics store in the United States uses the exact same distributor: Diamond Comics Distributors. The collected graphic novels can be purchased directly through the publishers or through book distributors, but if you want to sell the staple-bound monthly so-called &amp;ldquo;floppies,&amp;rdquo; you have to go through Diamond. There is no alternative. Diamond&amp;rsquo;s last competitor, a distributor called Heroes World, was bought by Marvel Comics and then collapsed in the mid-1990s.</description>

      <description>Seattleâs edition of the Bushwick Book Club is named after a popular Brooklyn series in which musicians write original music in response to a popular work of literature. Since 2010, local singer/songwriters and bands have been gathering at venues ranging from the Century Ballroom to Town Hall Seattle to the Can Can to sing songs about books including Slaughterhouse-Five, The Dark Knight Returns, and Silent Spring.
The Bushwick Book Club works best if youâre familiar with the books that the artists are singing about, of course, but even without a working knowledge of, say, Pride and Prejudice, youâll still enjoy a nice little live anthology of Seattle-area musicians.</description>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1484512941604/paterson.jpeg)
A lot of great movies adapted from written works have been released over the last month or so. Silence is a complex and challenging and ultimately rewarding adaptation of Shusaku Endoâs novel about the demands and responsibilities of faith. Fences is one of the most harrowing family dramas Iâve seen in years, with career-best performances from Denzel Washington and, especially, Viola Davis.
But one original movie in theaters right now, not adapted from a book or play, is a surprising tribute to the importance of the written word.</description>

      <description>The only way out is not through (bone).
When in doubt, donât just meat or martyr.
Before cutting off your hand to spite your captor, see if you can tip the jar. Sometimes, shoot it; when you do, aim for the gears.
If there arenât any scissors, start a fire. If thereâs room in the well, sardine.
Not every number is an incision, and not every rule is a law.</description>

In the days after the election of Donald Trump, poet Erin Belieu called on Facebook for writers and readers to not give in to despair and to âactively help make the world we want to live in.â Her appeal quickly went viral, evolving into a series of nearly 80 coordinated readings around the world on Sunday January 15th. Those readings are the launch of an organization called [Writers Resist](http://www.writersresist.org/). I talked with the organizers of Seattleâs Town Hall event, journalist [Kristen Millares Young](https://kristenmyoung.</description>

      <description>How Albert Woodfox survived solitary One week after joining the Black Panthers, Alfred Woodfox was arrested for robbery. Implicated in the murder of a prison guard, he spent 41 years in solitary confinement, longer than any American in history. His story, documented by Rachel Aviv, is one of extraordinary strength of mind â and the willful persistence of independence despite unbelievable social and physical constraints.
 On February 19, 2016, his sixty-ninth birthday, Woodfox packed his belongings into garbage bags and put about a hundred letters in a cardboard box.</description>

The Butterworth Building is haunted. Just ask anybody who works at Kells, the Irish pub in the basement of the building.
Opening in 1903, purpose built as a mortuary for the firm Butterworth &amp;amp; Sons, it was likely the first building in the United States to provide full mortuary services under one roof.</description>

It seems impossible that this week will bring both the annual celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Donald Trumpâs inauguration. But here we are. To mentally prepare for the discord to come, why not attend this freedom-minded reading by writers from Bellingham (Robert Lashley) and Spokane (novelist Jess Walter, poet Tod Marshall) and Seattle (Elissa Washuta, Jane Wong, G.</description>

      <description>Unreality show Interviewers sometimes ask me which mode of science fiction is easier to write: Utopia or dystopia? Look around you, I answer. Dystopian fiction is basically mimetic (realistic) fiction. Itâs way, way too sodding easy to depict a scenario so ubiquitous; I choose to get my jollies envisioning the Utopian coolness that could be.
Equality and perfection are two hallmarks of Utopias. Especially for members of non-dominant groups like myself &amp;mdash; women, queers, racial minorities, etc.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Superman guy, not a Batman guy. Batman&amp;rsquo;s fine âÂ I&amp;rsquo;ve read plenty of Batman comics over the years â but ultimately Batman is about arrested development: any Batman story is basically a story of an emotionally stunted rich dude. There&amp;rsquo;s only so much emotional wallowing you can do before you fall into parody. (I feel similarly about Trent Reznor: you can do a couple albums about the hurt in your soul, but after you make a couple critically acclaimed best-selling records, maybe you can afford a little therapy?</description>

About 20 employees will be affected. They are eligible to apply for positions at University Book Storeâs six other locations. Those stores, including ones in Seattleâs University District, Mill Creek and Tacoma, will remain open. Tu quotes University Book Store CEO Louise Little as saying the space, which UBS owns, is âlarger than we need,&amp;rdquo; and that UBS &amp;ldquo;is looking for a smaller space on the Eastside.</description>

Two Seattle-based fantasy authors debut new work at Seattleâs best sci-fi bookstore. If youâve been involved in our sci-fi community, you likely know Ramboâs name. Her newest book, Neither Here Nor There, is a collection of fantasy stories. You can see a tiny version of the nifty flip-cover format of the book right above this calendar entry. Chiavettaâs Sir Duffyâs Promise is the first in a new middle-reader fantasy series University Book Store, 4326 University Way N.</description>

      <description>âProvocativeâ has become a dirty word. As Donald Trump lurches toward the presidency and white nationalist Milo Yiannopoulos scores a $250,000 book deal, provocation has become synonymous with trolling, and trolling has gone mainstream. When Seattle authors Lindy West and Sherman Alexie very visibly quit Twitter last week, they demonstrated an exhaustion with provocation. Weâve had it with devilâs advocates and thought experiments that are intended to do nothing but get a reaction out of us.</description>

      <description>When a young man named Gary Groth established a magazine to address comics as a serious literary art form, he encountered one small problem: at the time â in the mid-1970s â there were no comics worthy of his criticism. So Groth decided to publish the books that he wanted to write about in his magazine. That was the beginning of Fantagraphics Books, the self-described âpublisher of the worldâs greatest cartoonists.</description>

Snooze-button darling,

scrubbing the pans till they star-shine,
making the mirror a gleaming lake.
When I come to you
you donât wake.
Atalanta and Hippomenes
I have a meat-eaterâs heart,
and baby, youâre the whole buffet.
Youâre ribs slick with smearing sauce,
midnight ice cream
too tempting not to eat &amp;mdash;
you sugared cheat.
You thump between my teeth.

With no apprentice in training, he may be the last to practice the almost medical art of book-mending on our library&amp;#8217;s aging circulation.
And that&amp;#8217;s a shame: not just because the craft is beautiful, but because the practice of repair reflects an attitude of compassion and care that we badly need right now.</description>

      <description>The humble writing prompt is such a great device. When you&amp;rsquo;re stuck, as a writer, often times the perception is that there aren&amp;rsquo;t any ideas, and that the world is bereft of good plots.
Given the idiosyncrasies of human thinking, what&amp;rsquo;s maybe going on is that you are stuck in your own loops. Prompts, from the brain/emotion loops of other humans, can be helpful to spark an idea. Other&amp;rsquo;s ideas surprise you, like the punchline to a good joke, and in that surprise comes a stepping out of yourself into another possible imagination.</description>

      <description>The final paragraph of this Seattle Times story about layoffs at KOMO by Rachel Lerman really hammers home how absolutely screwed the Seattle media scene is these days:  NBC News shut down its Seattle-based Breaking News startup, and [The *Seattle Globalist*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/12/15/sarah-glidden-gets-animated-for-the-seattle-globalist/), a nonprofit news site, is working to raise money from subscribers after the University of Washington announced it would no longer fund the site.

Sponsor Northwest Associated Arts is bringing David Sedaris to the Broadway Performance Hall for eight performances over seven days. This is astonishing on its own, but even better? Sedaris will be workshopping his new novel _Theft by Finding_ â this is your chance to see inside his creative process.
There&amp;rsquo;s more information on our sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page, or you can buy tickets â we suggest you grab some before all the performances are sold out, as of this writing, half the dates already are.</description>

      <description>A free Brooklyn-based comics newspaper called Smoke Signal â the same magazine that partially inspired Seattle&amp;rsquo;s late, lamented Intruder comics paper â is publishing a special anti-Trump comics paper called Resist! Published in time for Inauguration Day and with a print run of over 30,000 copies, Resist! ought to make a splash as one of the first artistic protests of President Trump.Â Resist! is edited by Raw co-founder FranÃ§oise Mouly and Nadja Spiegelman, and it seeks to publish (mostly women-produced) comics &amp;ldquo;on the theme of political resistance to the forces of intolerance.</description>

      <description>This is unprofessional for a critic, but I have to gush: I loved reading Claudia Rankineâs book Citizen: An American Lyric. I love everything about this book: I love the look of it, the feel of it, the words and the design and the passion and the craft of it. Citizen, to me, feels like the future of non-fiction books: a beautiful, book-length essay delivered in raw, vital chunks of text, interspersed with color photos and relevant pieces of art.</description>

      <description>Last monthâs Reading Through It Book Club was a great success, a night in which nearly a hundred Seattleites gathered to discuss an America that they felt they didnât recognize anymore. The event âÂ a coproduction between the Seattle Weekly, the Seattle Review of Books, and Third Place Books Seward Park â didnât provide a whole lot of answers, but it did evoke important questions of class and race and intergenerational poverty.</description>

Hey folks, I&#39;m leaving Twitter because its negatives increasingly outweigh its positives. Thank you for the follows. Some speculated that Alexie&amp;rsquo;s account had been hacked, but Alexie confirmed over email with the Seattle Review of Books that he decided to leave Twitter. His Twitter account appears to have been deleted (or at least deactivated) since that January 1st posting.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been a tremendous honor âÂ we&amp;rsquo;ve been proud to pay poets for their work, and to meet so many of the talented individuals who call Seattle home. We hope you enjoy stopping by the site every Tuesday morning to read a new poem. But because it&amp;rsquo;s a new year, we thought we&amp;rsquo;d try something new for our recurring Tuesday feature.</description>

      <description>Since you mention it, I think I will start that race war.
I couldâve swung either way? But now Iâm definitely spending
the next 4 years converting your daughters to lesbianism;
Iâm gonna eat all your guns. Swallow them lock stock and barrel
and spit bullet casings onto the dinner table;
Iâll give birth to an army of mixed-race babies.
With fathers from every continent and genders to outnumber the stars,</description>

Tomorrow we begin a new year in earnest, with several fun new features and more on the way. But today, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for something to do, stop by Comics Dungeon in Wallingford for their annual year-end (and year-beginning) sale. Take it from me: there is no joy as pure as digging through a box of $1 comics and finding $20 worth of cultural artifacts to plow through on a cold winter afternoon.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I get a little obsessive about my reading. As a child, I recall spending one New Yearâs Eve reading Terry Pratchettâs novel Sourcery as quickly as I could âÂ partly because it captured my attention so intently, and partly because I wanted to close the year by finishing a book. Further, I wanted to begin the year with a brand-new book. This desire to start the new year with a new book felt like a powerful urge.</description>

Most progress is incremental, but the breakthroughs â likeDeep Blue&amp;#8217;s victory over Fan Hui â are both exhilarating and terrifying. Now Google Translate has another.

      <description>Joan Rivers was one of the most fascinating entertainers of the 20th century. Anyone over the age of 30 can probably tell you something about her life âÂ the way Johnny Carson blacklisted her from his show, for instance, or her QVC shopping empire, or her vicious insults of celebrities, or her catchphrase, &amp;ldquo;can we talk?&amp;rdquo; â and every adult under 30 has undoubtedly seen a comedian who was profoundly influenced by Rivers&amp;rsquo;s work.</description>

      <description>By the end of 2016, I found myself completely disillusioned by corporate comics. Marvel Comics seem to be a neverending morass of recycled events and weird brand management choices. A few DC Comics titles are promising, but it seems as though getting comfortable there might be a mistake since the entire line will likely be rebooted as soon as sales drop low enough. These things happen in cycles, of course. A few years ago, Marvel was producing a bunch of work that transcended corporate dictates, and DC has had its moments over the last decade, too.</description>

      <description>Wednesday December 28th: Play It As It Lays Book Club
Booksellers at the south endâs newest bookstore discuss the divine Joan Didionâs 1970 novel Play It As It Lays. Didion is (rightfully) best known for her nonfiction, but her novels are in danger of being entirely forgotten. Let Thid Placeâs Anje and Wesley help you understand why that would be an absolute crime. Third Place Books Seward Park, 5041 Wilson Ave S, 474-2200, http://thirdplacebooks.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re going to be traveling home after the holidays and you stop in the airport bookstore looking for something to read, you could do a lot worse than Robert Harris&amp;rsquo;s new novel Conclave. It feels like a slight read, a novella that was blown out to fit into a novel â I thought I&amp;rsquo;d been sent a large print edition when I first opened Conclave and saw the huge font size â but it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect length for a plane ride and it&amp;rsquo;ll keep you turning pages through even the worst turbulence.</description>

      <description>When the doctor runs out of words and still
I won&amp;rsquo;t leave, he latches my shoulder and
steers me out doors. Where I see his blurred hand,
through the milk glass, flapping goodbye like a sail
(&amp;amp; me not griefstruck yet but still amazed: how
words and names â medicine&amp;rsquo;s blunt instruments â
undid me. And the seconds, the half seconds
it took for him to say those words). For now,</description>

Our sponsor this week, Martin McClellan, wants you to know he just published his entire novel to read online for free!
Wait â isn&#39;t he one of the co-founders of this site? 
Sure is!
Isn&#39;t that a little...unethical?
How so?
Well, I mean, he&#39;s advertising his own product on the place he runs. Kind of like a conflict-of-interest isn&#39;t it?
No, not really â it&#39;s what, in the tech world, they call &#34;</description>

      <description>(Every Monday in December, we&amp;rsquo;re asking a local bookseller which books they&amp;rsquo;d like to receive for a holiday gift. Our final bookseller is Emma Nichols, who works at Elliott Bay Book Company and who also hosts the wonderful Drunk Booksellers podcast. Emma chose Atlas Obscura: An Explorer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the World&amp;rsquo;s Hidden Wonders, by Joshua Foer and Dylan Thuras.)

Iâm really into maps and so the name struck me. But itâs not a book about maps, itâs about weird places all over the world, and Iâm very interested in the unknown and the strange.</description>

      <description>Did you hear the one about Robert Downey Jr, back when he was struggling with substance abuse? One night, all lit up on some combo of booze and pills and who knows what, he broke into a dark house, went into a little girlâs room, stripped down, and passed out in her empty bed. When the family came home they found him gently snoring. Imagine them there, in the doorway, the girl, the dad, the mom â maybe a brother â looking at this handsome movie star asleep in the bed.</description>

      <title>Why I accidentally gave Short Run the short shrift</title>

      <description>A reader wrote in to address an important omission from my piece that reviewed 2016&amp;rsquo;s highs and lows. I did not, she wrote, mention Short Run even once.
And you know, that reader is correct. Short Run was fabulous this year, and I should&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned it. This is part of the problem with year-end pieces, and why I&amp;rsquo;m not fully comfortable with writing them: there&amp;rsquo;s never enough room to make everything fit, things get forgotten, and then good people get their feelings hurt.</description>

Shorter days are made brighter by clever short stories, both dark and sparkling. Nobody does a twist in the tale like O.Henry unless itâs Edith Wharton or Edgar Allan Poe. Or, try a more modern master via any of the stories in Roald Dahlâs un-fairy-tale collections for adults: Switch Bitch, Kiss Kiss, Someone Like You.</description>

      <description>Last week, I was thoroughly disappointed by a comic book that was supposedly about the enduring power of stories. This week, Iâm entirely enchanted by a comic that demonstrates the empowering endurance of stories. Isabel Greenbergâs hardcover comic The One Hundred Nights of Hero is a story about stories wrapped in other stories, including a Scheherazade scenario in which a woman must tell a story so compelling that it distracts a lecherous man from advancing on her, night after night.</description>

      <description>Seattle-area writer Paul Mullin just announced that he&amp;rsquo;s kicking off 2017 with a new reading series called Loud Mouth Lit. Admission is free, it happens at Greenlake&amp;rsquo;s St. Andrewâs Bar and Grill, and the first reading happens on January 31st at 8 pm, with new outings on the last Tuesday of every month thereafter.
Loud Mouth Lit looks to be a nice blend of literary and theater influences, bringing together Mullin&amp;rsquo;s experience as a Stranger Genius Award-winning playwright and a memoirist.</description>

      <description>Book reviewing is a funny business. Youâre expected to read, process, and devise a response to a text in a matter of weeks (at best) or (realistically) days. But really it takes months to fully digest a book, to contextualize it in your life and discern its full value. With that in mind, Iâd like to open by talking about the books that stuck with me this year.
Out of the 100 or so books Iâve read in 2016, many of them have disappeared entirely from my brain â they didnât make a mark.</description>

      <description>The Washington Center for the Book just announced their 2017 Seattle Reads title. From May 8th to 11th, Angela Flournoy will read from her debut novel The Turner House in locations around the city. SPL locations will carry plenty of copies of The Turner House in stock so you can take part. Here&amp;rsquo;s their description of the book:

      <description>Mary Ann Gwinn at the Seattle Times says that seven local booksellers from University Book Store, Third Place Books, Elliott Bay Book Company, Liberty Bay Books, Village Books, and Eagle Harbor Book Company have won &amp;ldquo;bookseller bonuses&amp;rdquo; from ridiculously wealthy author James Patterson.
 Well, here&amp;rsquo;s a disgusting bit of year-end fuckery: Penguin Random House, the large publisher that formed when Penguin merged with Random House, &amp;ldquo;has derecognised the National Union of Journalists and Unite for collective bargaining with its management,&amp;rdquo; according to The Bookseller, which reports the move has left staff &amp;ldquo;nervous.</description>

      <description>In the saltwater aquarium at the pain clinic
lives a yellow tang
who chews the minutes in its cheeks
while we await our unguents and anesthesias.
The big gods offer us this little god
before the turning of the locks
in their Formica cabinets
in the rooms of our interrogation.
We have otherwise been offered magazines
with movie stars whose shininess
diminishes as the pages lose
their crispness as they turn.</description>

This week, Sagging Meniscus Press is back to show their new book from Fay Webern: _The Button Thief of East 14th Street: Stories from a Life on the Lower East Side 1927-1957_. It&#39;s an captivating work that captures New York at a vital time, seen from the inside.
We have a full, long chapter on our sponsorâs page, but we&amp;rsquo;re embedding a YouTube video here, as well, of Webern reading a short chapter called &amp;ldquo;The Pretzel Lady at Union Square&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>âIâm bored of the early 21st,â our narrator Spens tells us at the beginning of Robert Dicksonâs sci-fi thriller The Tourist. By â21st,â he means âcentury.â Heâs a tour guide leading groups of time-traveling tourists on journeys through our mundane present â the travelers are horrified and fascinated by our shopping malls, for instance. Mostly, he sits and drinks coffee and eats pastry for the novelty of it (it&amp;rsquo;s simultaneously tasteless and too sweet for his future-palate) while his group wanders around having innocuous interactions with 21st century residents.</description>

  The election of Donald Trump confirmed everything I knew of my country and none of what I could accept. The idea that America would follow its first black president with Donald Trump accorded with its history.</description>

Denning recalled my review of Percy&amp;rsquo;s craft talk at the Hugo House from last year, in which I was thoroughly unimpressed by the unoriginality of Percy&amp;rsquo;s advice. Denning makes the argument that while Percy&amp;rsquo;s advice may lean toward the oft-repeated, his &amp;ldquo;good-but-not-groundbreaking craft book&amp;rdquo; could serve as &amp;ldquo;a cheerleader&amp;rdquo; to comfort an aspiring writer.</description>

      <description>One Week in the Library comes in a format that doesnât get enough play in comics shops: a ten dollar âgraphic novellaâ that tells a single story from beginning to end. Itâs a great format â not quite long enough to be a full-sized graphic novel, but longer than your standard monthly comics issue. More cartoonists should work at this size; itâs a great length for the medium.

      <description>Sam Jordison&amp;rsquo;s essay in the Guardian about how Fight Club activated a generation of young white men and turned them into trolls, Trump fans, fascists, and Gamergaters is well worth your time:
Rereading the novel in 2016 is chilling. Researching the book online, I found myself falling down a dark wormhole of fascistic websites that quote big chunks of David Fincherâs film adaptation as parts of their credo; even though parts are almost verbatim from the book, alt-right types tend to quote the film â because they either donât agree with the overall message of Palahniukâs book or they havenât bothered to read it.</description>

Donât get me wrong â there are still plenty of readings between now and the end of the year, but this is the one time of year when literary-minded folks are not spoiled for choice: rather than three or four good options a day, Seattleâs readers readers are lucky to get one.</description>

      <description>Is there a better lede than this in all of journalism this week? I think not:
Exalted writer Natsume Soseki has returned as an android 100 years after his death and is reciting his own work. In case you&amp;rsquo;re worried about the world of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep coming true, video of the Soseki android indicates that a lot of progress needs to happen between the present day and a workable lifelike automaton:</description>

      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s Black List Awards, which celebrate the greatest unproduced screenplays, were announced yesterday. Coincidentally, two Black List winners share a very interesting muse. Here&amp;rsquo;s a description of Kathy Charles&amp;rsquo;s screenplay The Kings of Maine:
Living with his wife and child in a trailer while working as a janitor, Stephen King struggles with alcoholism and his own dark history as he attempts to complete Carrie. And here&amp;rsquo;s the plot synopsis for Maximum King!</description>

      <description>Heidi MacDonald at the indispensible comics news blog The Beat reports on a petition to unseat Wonder Woman as an honorary ambassador at the United Nations. The petition blasts Wonder Woman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;overtly sexualized image&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;not [being] culturally encompassing or sensitive.&amp;rdquo; It seems that the petition was successful â Wonder Woman is no longer considered to be a UN ambassador, though it&amp;rsquo;s unclear how any fictional character can serve as an ambassador in the first place.</description>

      <description>Many of the Girl Scout songs
extorted a smile, our servile mugging &amp;mdash;
but this one we loved best.
Starring a calf being hauled in a minor key,
its refrain two mournful syllables: dona.
First came the long o &amp;mdash; in induction/seduction
to join the animal&amp;rsquo;s cargo cult, then came
the short a, when the calf turned to beef
with no last meal and no reprieve.
The gist of the lyric: that we could choose</description>

      <description>Thomas Friedman has always felt most comfortable analyzing topics from unusually high vantage points. From this perch â his critics would say ivory tower â he is a master at scanning the current terrain of our world, diagnosing where humanity is heading, and offering a roadmap to success.
In Thank You for Being Late, Friedman returns to this tried-and-true formula, focusing his gaze on why our politics and society feel so off-kilter today.</description>

  âAfter 17 years in Seattle, it&#39;s become obvious that I can&#39;t hike, I can&#39;t bike, and I can&#39;t ski. So I&#39;m getting the fuck out,â Seattle poet Maged Zaher joked at his last Seattle-area reading before moving to Atlanta early next year.</description>

After reading Iggy Peck, Architect and Rosie Revere, Engineer, I was dying to read this one, because the series is wonderful for parents and kids. I think itâs got a great positive message: Even though someone tells you canât do something, you can.</description>

But the week&amp;#8217;s must-see is a breathtaking photo essay by Daniel Berehulak documenting the antidrug campaign launched by Philippine president President Rodrigo Dutert in June. In just over a month, Berehulak photographed 57 men and women killed by the police and by vigilantes for real or supposed drug crimes.</description>

I can&amp;rsquo;t stand raccoons. With their tiny little hands and the way they clamber, brazen and unafraid, into human spaces, they unsettle me in a way that no insect or snake ever could. There is just enough human in raccoons to be recognizeable, but just enough snout and fang and fur to make them alien. A live raccoon sighting will always raise my hackles, and raccoon corpses by the side of the road have never invoked my sympathy.</description>

      <description>Zanadu Comics, the 41-year-old comics shop on 3rd Avenue downtown, has launched a crowdfunding campaign on GoFundMe to raise $80,000 to keep the lights on and the doors open. The shop cites &amp;ldquo;increased rent costs, and unfortunate city developments which includes a forced relocation due to building renovation late next year&amp;rdquo; as the reason for the campaign. It&amp;rsquo;s especially heartwarming to see that Pike Place Market comics shop Golden Age Collectables, has donated $500 to the campaign, leaving a comment that &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re all in this together!</description>

      <description>For over a decade now, Maged Zaherâs poems have bounced between Cairo and Seattle. Somehow, heâs bridged the revolutionary Arab Spring-era Middle East and the banal tech-centric cityscape of Seattle, finding the uneasy common ground between revolutionaries and middle managers. His poems are about the world, but theyâre also very specifically rooted in space; Zaher has written some of the most Seattle-y poems youâll ever readâabout our notoriously difficult dating scene, about our tech-bro culture, about corporate blandness encroaching into the arts.</description>

      <description>Abrams published a satire title for adults called Bad Little Children&amp;rsquo;s Book, under the pseudonym Arthur C Gackley. It&amp;rsquo;s a stupid work of faux covers that trade on 50s and 60s era children&amp;rsquo;s book painting styles, mixed with inappropriate messages. You&amp;rsquo;ve seen this kind of humor before &amp;mdash; it supposedly pokes holes in societal norms, and, according to the marketing department, is &amp;ldquo;edgy, politically incorrect parodies that speak to the bad little kid in all of us&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>One of the things that I hate most about Donald Trump is that heâs completely and irrevocably changed the way that I read. Like 9&amp;frasl;11 or the election of Barack Obama, Donald Trumpâs presidency has altered the tenor and tone of entire books for me. Iâll never again be able to read a presidential biography, for example, without the specter of Trump lingering just beyond the last few pages of the book, like the punchline to a bad fart joke.</description>

      <description>Seattle, at the old World&amp;rsquo;s Fair
He stands by the helm, his face full of blue
from the buildings at twilight, his hand
knuckled around a metal pole that keeps him
from falling, as he flies past the vaults
of startled mannequins, the red ohs of their lips.
Christmas lights are also falling
through the windshield, onto his chest:
right side green, left side red &amp;mdash;
dark then back again.</description>

      <description>Lucia Perillo died on October 16 of this year. A MacArthur Genius who was shortlisted for the Pulitzer, Perillo was a poet of crafted precision, observation, and wit. John W Marshall, previous owner of Open Books, eulogized her for us, in this review.
As you probably know, we run an original poem from a local poet each Tuesday. Each poet recommends the next, in a chain that takes us places a call for submission never would: we travel on the tastes and friendships of poets.</description>

Our sponsor this week is Nick K Adams, and his book _My Dear Wife and Children: Civil War Letters From a 2nd Minnesota Volunteer_ is a remarkable document. Adams has transcribed his great-grandfather&#39;s letters about going to war, and offered context and editorial notes to help explain his experience.
The letters span a number of years, from their author, David Brainard Griffin, signing up, through battles and the pain of missing a family when away at war.</description>

      <description>There are fewer greater pleasures in literature than watching a serious writer of fiction wade into the denigrated waters of genre and emerge with something exquisitely written yet propulsively entertaining all at the same time. Yes, Graham Greene produced enduring novels about British colonialism, but were any of them better than Brighton Rock, a tale of a gang war in a resort town in southern England just before World War II?</description>

This piece by Nigerian novelist and MacArthur Genius Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is the call to action we need right now. Clear-eyed, urgent, and right:</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;If you fear change, youâll be horrified to learn that this new site is more than just a cosmetic improvement,&amp;rdquo; is how they put it, before informing us that they are releasing their complete digital archive. Every single piece from their archive is available. Like The New Yorker, or Harper&amp;rsquo;s, it comes at a price: a subscription to the magazine.
But, like always, their writer&amp;rsquo;s interviews are available for free. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the best online resources to learn from absolute masters of the craft, many of whom are now long dead, and have achieved the kind of mythical status that almost makes you surprised they ever were interviewable at all.</description>

      <description>The big problem with Wonder Woman, the reason why the character has had a hard time taking hold, is that DC Comics keeps restarting her from scratch. I can&amp;rsquo;t keep track of how many times I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the Wonder Woman character rebooted and relaunched. Sure, other DC mainstays like Batman and Superman tend to wallow in retellings of their origin stories, but those stories never seem to change as much as Wonder Woman&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

Alexie, who has directed films in the past, will write the screenplay for the adaptation. Jackman will also play a supporting role in the film. This is a big damn deal for a book that has demonstrated remarkable longevity with young readers.</description>

Never in the history of Seattle readings has an author so brazenly stepped on his own introduction. Last night at University Temple United Methodist Church, University Book Store CEO Louise Little was seemingly just getting started with her introduction for Senator Bernie Sanders when a raucous wall of applause broke out in the back of the church and proceeded to the front of the building. It was so loud, and so continuous, that Littleâs voice was entirely drowned out.</description>

      <description>In 1987 I bought a small, struggling bookstore in my neighborhood. I was a godsend for the then-owner and the store was a godsend for me. Prior, I had studied to become, and became, a rehabilitation counselor. That means, seen in hindsight, that I had engaged in expensive self-help at a very good university and then wandered into a career. The bookstore was a much better fit as it allowed me to associate with books and their makers â loves from a very early age â rather than keeping company with other damaged people and their insurance companies.</description>

The youngest son of âBig Jimâ Whittaker, the first American to climb Mount Everest, is also a mountain climber. Maybe Leif Whittaker can explain what the deal is with his bizarre family business â everybody knows the punchline âbecause itâs there,â but what really makes two generations of a family decide to climb mountains?

The catchphrase of The Furnace reading series is descriptive, intense, and memorable: âOne Writer. One Story. Read to completion (with vigor).â Itâs oddly sexual in tone â I can think of no other reading series in Seattle that is described with the same language as a handjob â but itâs exactly what you get when you show up for a Furnace reading.
Founded by Seattle writers Anca Szilagyi and Corinne Manning in 2012, the quarterly Furnace series has brought one writer to Hollow Earth Radioâs studios before a live studio audience to read a story that incorporates audio elements like music and sound effects.</description>

      <title>Book News Roundup: The season of lists is upon us</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of book list season, which is a holiday that I must admit kind of befuddles me. I&amp;rsquo;m not a list-maker. I find lists to be very unsatisfying. But many of you like them, and that is, of course, okay. I&amp;rsquo;d like to direct your attention to two of the biggest lists of the season: The New York Public Library has published its list of the top books for kids and teens and the New York Times published their 100 Notable Books of 2016.</description>

      <description>&amp;mdash; after Alison Prine
I was here before the house came down.â¨I ran up its carpeted stairs,
my feet bare; I stood dripping
in a towel just outside the bedroom door;
I daydreamt of making a mural
of the hallway wall,
my hands full of tacks and yarn.
I came along the backcountry road,
its tar hot and melting in the August sun.
I passed a boy playing crow</description>

Sponsor Anna Redsand is coming to Seattle to do a reading, and discussion with Ann Przyzycki, the editor of [_Isthmus_](http://www.isthmusreview.com/), about publishing. This event, on December 3rd, will be a great resource for writers interested in publication from the author and publisher&#39;s perspective, as well as doing a DIY book tour, and the kinds of challenges faced by writers and publishers.
Redsand is also supporting her book To Drink From the Silver Cup: From Faith Through Exile and Beyond.</description>

      <title>Scenes from the Indies First party bus tour</title>

      <description>On Saturday, Sherman Alexie rented a party bus, stuffed it full of 24 Seattle-area writers, and led the charge to three Seattle-area bookstores. It was an ambitious broadening of the Indies First program that Alexie originated in Seattle a few years ago, in which authors serve as &amp;ldquo;guest booksellers&amp;rdquo; at independent bookstores on Small Business Saturday. And the scaling up of the concept required a few sacrifices: some of Seattle&amp;rsquo;s smaller bookstores couldn&amp;rsquo;t physically contain a swarm of 25 authors at once, for instance, and the sheer amount of time it takes to get a group that large around town limited the number of bookstore visits that were possible.</description>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1479958928363/Rick.jpg)
So far as origin stories go, no superhero ever had a better one.
Rick Simonson was working in the kitchen of a restaurant called Das Gasthaus on Occidental Ave in Pioneer Square. A transplant from Nebraska, Simonson was unsure exactly what he wanted to do with his life, but for the moment he needed a job and the kitchenâs trash needed taking out. As he was lugging out the garbage, Simonson noticed a warm glow from an open door at 109 S.</description>

      <description>How Visionary Chef Sean Brock Nearly Went Blind Sean Brock is a James Beard-winning chef with a string of successful restaurants, a killer guitar collection, and a connoisseur&amp;rsquo;s taste for bourbon. He also has a little-understood condition that&amp;rsquo;s stealing his eyesight&amp;mdash;and the cost goes up each time he walks into a kitchen. This profile by Brett Martin is heartwrenching, and telling about what we value.
 There are approximately 16,000 photos on Brock&#39;s iPhone.</description>

And in the meantime, I have some advice for you. I&amp;rsquo;m not a professional advice-giver like Cienna, but here&amp;rsquo;s my best shot:
 If you&amp;rsquo;re working on your NaNoWriMo novel this weekend and you&amp;rsquo;re having trouble getting through the home stretch, give your protagonist amnesia.</description>

      <description>Once, over drinks, a friend leaned in so close I could smell the clove cigarettes on her breath, and then she told me the truth. âLiving in Seattle,â she said, âis like being madly in love with a beautiful woman whoâs sick all the time.â
This was probably fifteen years ago, but itâs one of those moments that juts into the gears of your mind and blows the whole mechanism to pieces.</description>

      <description>We got an email from Secret Garden Bookshop&amp;rsquo;s Suzanne Perry explaining the Ballard bookshop&amp;rsquo;s Christmas gift program, and it sounds like a damn good cause:
Through the holiday season, 120 green angels displayed around our shop represent children&#39;s names, ages, and their heart&#39;s desire in the form of a new book. They&#39;ve been collected by our friend [Michele Bacon](http://www.michelebacon.com), who, for the third year running, has worked in close association with three local schools: Whitman Middle School, Salmon Bay, and BF Day.</description>

UK crime fiction scribes Steve Cavanagh and Luca Veste deliver silly laughs &amp;mdash; how about those ducks? &amp;mdash; as well as more practical pearls of wisdom, chatting about publishing news (and some non-publishing news, too), hosting book reviewers, and interviewing fellow crime fiction writers like Ian Rankin, Stuart Neville &amp;mdash; who contributes the podcastâs twangy-groovy interstitial music &amp;mdash; CL Taylor, Craig Robertson, Mark Billingham, and Ruth Ware.</description>

For decades, American retail employees called the day after Thanksgiving âBlack Friday,â but they did so in the stockrooms and break rooms of their stores, away from customers. Managers used the term because Thanksgiving weekend sales are what typically drive a storeâs yearly profits into the black. Ground-level employees called the day âBlack Fridayâ because it was so brutal it could kill you.
At some point, âBlack Friday entered the popular vernacular as the name of an official shopping holiday, and that was when holiday shopping started to get really out of hand; without âBlack Fridayâ as a popular concept, you donât get Target employees who have to leave their familyâs Thanksgiving dinners early so they can open the store for a bunch of ungrateful yahoos who will happily murder their neighbors to get their hands on a deeply discounted flat screen TV.</description>

      <description>The nature of work has changed significantly in the last 50 years, and itâs frankly kind of amazing that thereâs not rioting in the streets over it. Think about it: at one point in American history, employers were expected to offer full-time jobs with benefits and a retirement program. Fewer and fewer Americans ever enjoy that kind of a relationship, and the rush into piecework only gains speed with the passage of time.</description>

      <description>News broke yesterday that author William Trevor passed away. Literary Hub has a wonderful roundup of audio and visual files of Trevor appearances and remembrances of Trevor by other authors.
 Sadly appropriate for our time: Umberto Eco&amp;rsquo;s list of 14 common features of fascism. Here&amp;rsquo;s number seven:
  The obsession with a plot. âThe followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.</description>

      <description>If a tree falls in the woods
And no one is there to hear it
Does it even make a sound?
Alternative version:
If a police officer shoots a black kid
and no one saw the bullet
Is the black kid really dead?
If a white man goes on a killing spree is he a terrorist?
Or mentally ill?
Or a wolf in white skin?
If the black kid does not get a hashtag</description>

Our inspiring sponsor, Susan Marie Conrad, did something many of us want to do, but almost nobody does: she kayaked the entire Inside Passage, from Anacortes to Juneau, Alaska. You and I both know this story is more than just the logistics of paddling, and Conrad delivers a great story in her book _Inside: One Womanâs Journey Though the Inside Passage_. It&#39;s well-told, rife with personal accomplishment, and that kind of self-examination that only comes from pitting oneself against nature.</description>

Designed by developer Givi Phirtskhalava, the site presents you with the first page of a novel as a blank, standalone item without title, author, or cover, allowing you to experience the beginning of a book without coloring it with any preconceived ideas. You just read the first page and if you like it, you push a button to reveal the title and author.</description>

I arrived in Seattle on May 4th, 2000. I applied for a job at Elliott Bay Book Company two days later. My first day at Elliott Bay Book Company was May 15th. I cannot express how important being hired at Elliott Bay was for me, what it did for my life. I had worked at a Borders in Boston for years, but Elliott Bay was, quite obviously, something different. It was more serious than Borders, felt more like a place of worship.</description>

      <description>Obama Reckons With a Trump Presidency This David Remnick piece has received a lot of, rightful, attention this week. Imagine being one of the most capable, measured, and successful presidents of the modern age, and handing off to the hot gilded mess approaching the front gates. The horror.
But Obama has remarkable statesmen like resolve, and as he told a crowd recently, &amp;ldquo;Iâm going to be constrained in what I do with all of you until I am again a private citizen.</description>

Friday November 18th: As Sarah Galvin noted in her excellent review, **Michelle Tea** is an iconic memoirist and queer sex symbol. Her newest book, *Black Wave*, is a memoir with a dystopic novel laid over the top, which kind of resembles the world in which we live right now.</description>

Imagine if cosplay was a thing in the early 1990s. Now imagine that a Fantagraphics cartoonist at the time âÂ Dan Clowes, maybe â made a comic about people who dressed up like superheroes at comics conventions. You could practically imagine the scorn steaming off the page, canât you? The 1990s alternative comics scene was such a self-consciously self-reflexive organism that it could only refer to comics and nerd culture by mocking it.</description>

      <description>If you ever attend a David Sedaris reading, I suggest you watch him closely. Youâll see that as he reads, he keeps a pencil in his hand and he makes notations on the text. Sometimes if you pay close attention to his hands, you can see him cross out a word that he stumbles on, or add a word when an improvisation works particularly well. When you attend a Sedaris reading, youâre not just watching a performance â youâre taking part in an editing session.</description>

In the shadow of this disastrous election, itâs almost impossible to think about Christmas. But whether youâre ready or not, the holidays are coming, and there are lots of people you love out there in the world who deserve a little happiness in their lives. Books are the best gift: theyâre deeply personal, they help us empathize with each other, and theyâre so much more meaningful than, say, a juicer.</description>

      <description>In the wake of Donald Trumpâs election, it should be obvious to everyone that the Urban Archipelago concept promoted by thinkers like Richard Florida â the idea of cities as strongholds of liberal progress â was a dead end. As liberals spent twelve years building cities into citadels of progressivism and waiting for national demographics to shift our way, we allowed the Rust Belt to erode and we fostered an us-versus-them relationship with rural America.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Fantagraphics Books announced that they&amp;rsquo;re entering into a partnership with young British comics publisher Breakdown Press. The Seattle-based publisher is bringing some (not all) of the very best of Breakdown&amp;rsquo;s output to American bookstores and comics shops, starting with Anna Haifisch&amp;rsquo;s book The Artist and Hayashi Seiichi&amp;rsquo;s book Red Red Rocks and Other Stories 1967-1970. Breakdown&amp;rsquo;s catalog looks very cool âÂ a mix of international artists working in a variety of styles.</description>

      <description>A Filipino restaurant is bone marrow
and vinegar boiling
perfectly over the sound
of the most dramatic Tagalog
soap opera youâve ever been forced to watch.
I come here, when I can afford it,
when my homesick can only be cured
by my motherâs hands
The server is a young woman,
possibly in her 20âs with a posture
thatâs been carrying the weight of her fatherâs expectations.
She calls me, âAteâ every time I come in.</description>

      <description>I shouldnât have been surprised by Brexit. And I shouldnât have been surprised by the intensity of Donald Trumpâs support among a volatile electorate. Living in a too-homogenous left-wing enclave on the West Coast, I was caught off guard. But I should have known better: I study racial and religious politics in Europe for a living, and this story is so familiar it hurts. So when the New York Times posted a video of Trump supporters screaming vicious racist epithets at a rally a few weeks ago, to tell us all to look!</description>

      <description>Step 1: Visit, send an email to, or call your local independent neighborhood bookstore. Talk to the store owner. Ask how they feel about the prospect of a President Trump.
Step 2: Consider this tweet, from the owner of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest bookstore:
Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump. I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.
&amp;mdash; Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 Step 3: Ask yourself, which reaction best reflects your values?</description>

Our November Bookstore of the Month, Elliott Bay Book Company, is a store that prides itself on its history and its strong sense of continuity. But not everyone at Elliott Bay has worked there for decades. New booksellers start at the store all the time, and they make their mark pretty quickly. Mary Thompson started at Elliott Bay in mid-June. Itâs her first bookstore job, though not her first literary job âÂ she worked at the Hugo House doing front desk and events assistance before getting into bookselling.</description>

      <description>A Time for Refusal Well, I was going to go election-free today. I thought: &amp;ldquo;wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice to read around the thing, to not have to face it every moment. Why can&amp;rsquo;t we have a Sunday morning without the election?&amp;rdquo;
I still think that&amp;rsquo;s a fine goal, but to be honest, the best things published this week are about the election. Everybody is thinking about the election. Everybody is writing about the election.</description>

Who has been reading tweet-storms about every liberal nightmare, and how they will come to pass. Who looks at the other America, and wonders how they could vote for that man, who showed us exactly who he was, and what that person must think of you, and your friends, all of whom you are worried for?</description>

      <description>From the New York Times review of Settle for More, the memoir from Fox News host Megyn Kelly:
Ms. Kelly writes that her problems started in August, the Monday before the first Republican presidential primary debate. She had just done a segment on her show, âThe Kelly File,â that infuriated Mr. Trump. He refused to make his own scheduled appearance on her show unless she phoned him personally.
âI almost unleashed my beautiful Twitter account against you,â she says he told her, âand I still may.</description>

Short Run Comix &amp;amp; Arts Festival was packed this year. There were quite a few booths I had to skip because of people eagerly blocking them. This is good âÂ I was there a few hours after opening, and more than one artist I talked to spoke about being sold out of some items.
My favorite from last year, Laura Knetzger was back with a few new issues of her delightful comic Bug Boys.</description>

      <description>Pre-election anxiety kept me from enjoying my Short Run Comix &amp;amp; Arts Festival to its fullest on Saturday. Last year, I wandered the floor for hours and talked to dozens of people. This year, I could only hang on the sidelines before diving into an aisle for a few minutes and then, overwhelmed by the crowds, retreating again. (Luckily, thousands of people were there to pick up my slack: it seemed as though there were even more attendees at this yearâs Short Run than at last yearâs, and social media seems to indicate that most of Short Runâs artists sold more books than any other year of the festival.</description>

Paul has recommended you go see Steven Barker on Thursday night at Hugo House. While I think that&#39;s a great option, I wanted to also recommend an alternative: Priscilla Long at the Elliott Bay Book Company.
Long has two newly released books: Minding The Muse: a Handbook for Painters, Composers, Writers, and Other Creators (reviewed today by Bonnie J Rough), and Fire and Stone: Where Do We Come From? What Are We?</description>

      <description>I have the usual prejudices about self-help books. They hook you with flattery, pamper your ego, promise easy fixes, make you a sucker and then a recidivist. Theyâre banal, corny, embarrassing, predatory, and mercenary to the tune of a growing multi-billion dollar industry. Theyâre cheap cons: they love you and leave you desperate for more. Self-help isnât real help. On the other hand, being a wet blanket 24&amp;frasl;7 is unyielding hard work, especially when a person needs a pick-me-up.</description>

      <description>Sherman Alexie has had a hellacious couple of years. In the summer of 2015, his mother passed away. Their relationship was always contentious and complicated, and throughout the late summer and early fall Alexie wrote dozens of poems while trying to work through his complicated grief. In December of last year, a doctor informed Alexie that he immediately needed surgery to remove a noncancerous brain tumor. The nine-hour procedure was wildly successful, but still terrifying as fuck the whole way through âÂ afterwards, Alexie was in the ICU for a day and in the hospital for a week before beginning a long recovery regimen at home.</description>

      <description>Fairly or unfairly, short stories set in the domestic sphere of the American 20th Century tend to live in the shade of the two famous white Johns â Updike and Cheever. Those two men have become synonymous with midcentury ennui of the upper middle class, a style which has been parodied and mocked and prized apart with postmodern angst and fastidiously replicated by sincere young writers, even to this day, in mainstream literary journals.</description>

      <description>She was perfect pitcher,
Cooled glass and ice center,
Crystal all her own bounty:
Solid hammer, extended bat broken
Cam, when is delicate fist
Worth more than peacock tailed
Beauty fanned against face?
She is not safe.
No one is safe
From the break.
Her grandmother was a witchdoctor
seafoam green eyes and muddy skin
the earth shook when she spoke
islands out of the sea, a place called home.</description>

      <description>Our thanks to sponsor Atelier26 for bringing the astounding book Funny-Ass Thoreau to our readers this week. The book, released officially on Tuesday the 8th, covers a side of America&amp;rsquo;s favorite recluse not seen in his more famous writings.
There&amp;rsquo;s a great sample on our sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page, so we can back up this astounding statement: Thoreau was, indeed, a very funny man. But don&amp;rsquo;t take our word for it, check out the book, and be sure to click through and pick up a copy if you like what you read.</description>

      <description>Democracyâs recent ubiquity is remarkably novel in human history. Yet even in its infancy we are unhesitatingly willing to crown it as the universal ideal of good and just government. To the critical mind, democracyâs virtues can appear overindulged.
After all, unless you came to this democratic nation under your own power, we have not actually chosen to live under this form of rule. Rather, we have awakened to the situation and tacitly consented to our present state.</description>

Elliott Bay Book Company is not the cityâs oldest bookstore â University Book Store is older, by over a half-century â but it is arguably our most iconic. Founded in 1973, Elliott Bay has changed ownership three times. The shop was founded and expanded in its original Pioneer Square location by Walter and Maggie Carr. When the Carrs retired, they sold the shop to Third Place Books owner Ron Sher in 1999.</description>

      <description>Elena Ferrante, Private Novelist Alexander Chee on Elena Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s upcoming new book.
 The bar for every writer of fiction is that the novel is an invented thing. And yet each time we write, novelists are treated like spiritualists who rip off the grief-stricken &amp;mdash; as though our inventions are some sort of hustle. _Surely you must have some experience like this: Tell us about it._ On tour for my first novel, a reader asked, _âHow much of this is autobiographical?</description>

**I was disturbed to read [Paul Constantâs editorial about Jack T. Chick]( http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/selling-mansions-in-heaven/). Much like Paul, I used the comics as a source of laughs. I use the word &#34;disturbed&#34; because the editorial points at a kind of revisionism that paints us, the kind of people that Jack T. maligned (a very broad category, Iâll admit), as being powerless subjects under him and our ironic consumption of his comics as acquiescence to his ideology.</description>

      <description>Tonight, as part of First Thursday Art Walk, the Brainfreeze art gallery âÂ where the Lusty Lady used to be, across from the Seattle Art Museum on 1st Avenue, downtown âÂ is hosting a launch party for a brand-new free publication thatâs trying to fill the gap left by the sadly defunct Intruder anthology comic. The debut issue of the new free quarterly comic Thick as Thieves looks almost exactly like an issue of Intruder, save for the fact that itâs only 8 pages rather than 16.</description>

Yesterday was comics artist Steve Ditkoâs 89th birthday, which made it an especially fitting day to watch a preview screening of Doctor Strange. Ditko was the co-creator of the Doctor Strange character, and those early comics, published in Strange Tales in the mid-1960s, were probably the purest example of Ditkoâs imagination ever put to paper. Strange frequently ventured to realms where giant creatures made of spikes would crawl out of pools of liquid floating in thin air, or where thick bands of ink formed protective barriers that would keep astral forms â essentially, the souls of humans â trapped away from their bodies.</description>

      <description>Seattle-area writer Ted Chiang has long been one of the local sci-fi community&amp;rsquo;s best-kept secrets. Just about every Seattle sci-fi writer worth their salt counts Chiang as one of their favorite writers, but his work has not garnered larger acclaim. That&amp;rsquo;s all about to change: one of Chiang&amp;rsquo;s short stories is about to be adapted into an upcoming film called Arrival starring Amy Adams that is attracting a lot of pre-release buzz.</description>

      <description>Wednesday November 2: Short Run International Comix Night
In just a few years, Seattleâs own Short Run Comix &amp;amp; Arts Festival has gone from a zine show packed into the Vera Project to an international affair. Tonight, Short Run brings four worldly cartoonists âÂ from Lebanon, Greece, Belgium, Mexico, and CroatiaÂ â to the downtown library to discuss the universal language of comics. Seattle Public Library, 1000 4th Ave., 386-4636,Â http://spl.</description>

      <description>Itâs an overwhelming year. Weâre all overwhelmed by the presidential election, weâve been overwhelmed by the continual cycle of cool celebrities dying and the swarm of overwrought tributes to said deceased cool celebrities that flood our social media feeds, and Seattleâs incredible growth âÂ and attendant anxieties â has been impossibly overwhelming all year long. In fact, everything has been overwhelming for so long that weâve forgotten what it is to feel whelmed.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a long winter, and this is a great way to stock up your nightstand.</description>

      <description>I am so sick and tired of Donald Trump. I know this is not a unique opinion, or an especially interesting one, but it is an opinion that I want to shout in a very public place, or paint on a giant wall somewhere, with âsickâ and âtiredâ both underlined three times for emphasis. Itâs an imperative, a biological urge, like being hungry or needing to use a bathroom. My body is rejecting Donald Trump the way it would cast out a foreign organ.</description>

      <description>On Mars, water once flowed. Where
did it go? Some froze, but scientists
suspect a cosmic cue ball &amp;mdash; a comet
etc. &amp;mdash; knocked Mars so hard
the planet escaped
its own atmosphere, just
left it there, jumped its own skin
like an anime cat
leaving his pajamas spread-eagle
in space. And now, goddammit,
David Bowie is dead.
I worshipped him like a flower
twists its dewy face to the brightest,</description>

      <description>Sponsor University of Washington Press has given us permission to run an excerpt from Ernestine Hayes&amp;rsquo; The Tao of Raven. Make sure you visit our sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page to read it.
Hayes, a native Alaskan living in Juneau, wrote about returning to Alaska in her first book, Blonde Indian. This book, part memoir, part cultural exploration, tunrs Hayes&amp;rsquo; unique voice to other stories, like completing college in her fifties and becoming a professor and writer.</description>

      <description>This is a neat idea: Alexander Chee is taking over the Hugo House&amp;rsquo;s Instagram feed this week to provide teasers of the story he&amp;rsquo;ll be reading at the House&amp;rsquo;s Literary Series event this Friday.
 Happy Halloween! This has to be the best literary Halloween tweet of the year:

      <description>(Photo of Ebo Barton by Adam Rubinstein of [Stopped Down Studio](http://www.stoppeddown.studio/).) Earlier this month, Seattle poet [Ebo Barton](https://www.facebook.com/pg/ebobartonpoetry/about/?entry_point=page_nav_about_item&amp;tab=page_info) took fifth place at the Individual World Poetry Slam in Flagstaff Arizona. We talked with them over email about the championship and the state of poetry in Seattle right now.
**Could you tell our readers what the process of getting to the Individual World Poetry Slam was like? How did you wind up delivering spoken word to an audience of people in Flagstaf?</description>

      <description>Undercover with a border militia A long, intense, and detailed look at the types of people who join militias, and the sorts of things they do inside. More investigative reporting like this, please.
 Becoming a militia member began with opening a new Facebook account. I used my real name, but the only personal information I divulged on my profile was that I was married and that I had held jobs as a welder and a prison guard for the Corrections Corporation of America.</description>

Someone more equipped to do arithmetic should figure out how many possible combinations of readings were available at Lit Crawl last night. With 35 readings stretched across four hours, your Lit Crawl experience was guaranteed to be different from mine. And thatâs sort of the appeal: to overwhelm your senses and to give you too many options. Youâre supposed to finish Lit Crawl feeling as though you missed out on something.</description>

      <description>Have you read Sarah Galvin&amp;rsquo;s great review of Michelle Tea&amp;rsquo;s new memoir/novel Black Wave yet? You should! It&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful celebration of Tea&amp;rsquo;s impact on young readers that also includes the words &amp;ldquo;sex millionaire.&amp;rdquo;
Tea herself notified us last night, however, that the review needs one correction:
@seattlereviewof â¤ï¸âï¸Though it&amp;#39;s @MattDillon I fuck in the book. I would NEVER fuck Brad Pitt.

      <description>As a lifelong atheist and comics fan â maybe not necessarily in that order â I was especially primed as a young man to fall in a kind of kitschy love with Jack Chickâs comics. In the late 1990s, I embraced Chickâs comics on the same level of so-bad-itâs-good appreciation that others would bring to a cheesy horror movie, say, or an embarrassingly mediocre record purchased from the discount bin at a thrift shop.</description>

      <description>In high school, Michelle Teaâs memoir/novels Valencia and The Chelsea Whistle flooded my virgin imagination with hope and lust for the adventures I had to look forward to as an adult queer. I particularly remember her description of one relatively understated float in her parade of lovers and/or lovers of a woman she was seeing (that itâs hard to remember which should evoke the grandeur of the parade.) She wrote that she saw the sleeping womanâs mousy brown head poking out from under a blanket, and couldnât recall when the sight had become a common occurrence.</description>

      <description>Wednesday October 26th: The Hidden Lives of Owls Reading
Look, fuck the election; itâs time to talk about owls. Leigh Calvez is an owl expert who will explain why owls are simultaneously cooler and more disgusting than the Harry Potter books ever let on. Maybe sheâll also explain why theyâre always wearing graduation caps in cartoons even if they havenât graduated college.

      <description>In just five years, Seattle Lit Crawl has become more than just a bookish pub crawl â itâs now the fever-pitch climax of autumn, the busiest night of the busiest time of the year for literary Seattle. On the evening of October 27th, 35 readings (each lasting 45 minutes, with programs starting at 6, 7, 8, and 9 pm) will unfold all over downtown, First Hill, and Capitol Hill. You can find a full listing of all the readings at litcrawl.</description>

      <description>Novelist Paul Beatty has won the Man Booker prize for The Sellout, his deeply satirical novel about race in our country. Great news, and congratulations to Beatty. This is the third year the prize has been open to writers of any nationality, and Beatty is the first American author to take it.
Before there was a Seattle Review of Books, co-founder Paul Constant reviewed the book for our good friends over at Seattlish:</description>

      <description>I do not believe it is hyperbolic to say that a little piece of Seattle died on the day that the Seattle Post-Intelligencer stopped publishing a daily print edition. The Seattle Times publishes some wonderful journalism, but a single newspaper cannot accurately portray the entire soul of a city. In the years since the P-I print edition died, though, we have seen some significant online publications grow to fill that void.</description>

      <description>In advance of tonight&amp;rsquo;s #JournalismSoWhite event at Town Hall, we wanted to recall our own diversity reports, written by our Public Diversity Editor, Vanessa Willoughby.
We published Vanessa&amp;rsquo;s first report on September 7th of this year. We think her observations and analysis of our work on this issue were right on-point.
As she pointed out: &amp;ldquo;Whether it be diverse representation in film or a diverse workplace, sometimes diversity doesnât necessarily mean equality.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s true that Donald Trump has admitted to never reading books. But in case you think he doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about books, please note that the Huffington Post revealed that Trump bought $300,000 in small donations to his campaign on books last month. Of course, the books he bought were copies of his ghost-written memoir The Art of the Deal. Weirdly, Trump also offered signed copies of The Art of the Deal as a fundraiser, even though&amp;hellip;</description>

The Vixen pinks his way through whiskers,
strikes a nice pliÃ©,
then knocks a shot of JÃ¤ger back,
and drops some Fourier.
The shaven Lion shyly strides
beside his own conceit:
a guileless wilding
twice defiled, but innocent and sweet.
Mama Panda and her Pup
(wily as Montaigne)
splay their limbs in slick abandon,
rolling through the rain.

Lucia Perillo, a poet known for her sense of humor and her writing about living with multiple sclerosis, died on Oct. 16 at the age of 58 in Olympia, Wash., her publisher Copper Canyon Press confirms. Her most recent book, âTime Will Clean the Carcass Bones,â was published in February. Perillo was a MacArthur &amp;ldquo;Genius&amp;rdquo; Fellowship winner, her work was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize, and she was no stranger to the Seattle literary scene.</description>

      <description>Time was, you just had to keep your eye on a few New York publications in order to see if there was any new writing from the top authors in the country. Now, thankfully, there are infinitely more outlets available. Case in point: earlier this month, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie published a great essay about the state of feminism on her Facebook page, and it&amp;rsquo;s slowly been making the rounds ever since.</description>

The Twitter feed of Chick Publications is reporting that Jack Chick, the religious cartoonist famous for his pocket-sezed &amp;ldquo;Chick tracts&amp;rdquo;, has died. His comics were incredibly hateful â they insisted that basically anyone who is not straight, white, and Evangelical is a failure of a human being who deserves to burn in hellÂ â but they were also hugely influential.
An army of artoonists, ranging from Dan Clowes to Steve Ellis and Fred Van Lente, have parodied Chick tracts.</description>

      <description>One summer day, early in the 21st-century, Iâm southbound on Bellevueâs NE 104th, approaching the NE 8th intersection, for generations the cityâs main one. It takes me two traffic lights to get through, and as I wait I study the towers just to my left (âBellevue Placeâ) and a range of other buildings ahead and to my right. Steel gleams in the diffused light through the usual cloud cover. Iâve ridden through here all my life, and driven it for over three decades, but I recognize nothing, only the slight downward slope as I pass through Kemperville down to Main Street.</description>

Nearly all former employees BuzzFeed News spoke to in the course of reporting this story said the same thing.</description>

Poet and libertine Arthur Rimbaud was born on October 20, 1854. If you&#39;re a super-fan, you can [buy the gun Verlaine used to shoot Rimbaud](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/gun-with-which-verlaine-shot-rimbaud-up-for-auction?CMP=twt_gu) (non-fatally, in the wrist).

      <description>Moss, the excellent free Northwest-centric literary magazine, is offering $20 annual subscriptions through Patreon, which gets you an annual print edition and early access to each quarterly issue of the magazine. This is absolutely a steal. Give if you can.
 You have until Halloween to apply for the Jack Straw Artist Residency programs, which teach artists how to better use sound as a medium. Most writers are, sad to say, terrible readers of their own work.</description>

When I was younger, I didnât really understand the appeal of Ben Katchorâs strip Julius Knipl: Real Estate Photographer. It has always been easy to see that Katchor is a talented artist â every panel is a beautifully composed portrait of urban life, every person in each panel has their own unique personality and history. But something about the strip resisted my attentions. I couldnât find a character to identify with in Knipl, or any situations that spoke to me.</description>

      <description>David M. Levyâs Mindful Tech: How to Bring Balance to Our Digital Lives begins with a description of a viral YouTube clip, which is fitting for a book about digital distractions. In the video, a woman strides through a shopping mall, eyes fixed on her smartphone, oblivious to her surroundings until she tumbles headfirst into a fountain. Just as quickly she climbs out and charges forward on her way.
The anecdote could come off as smug, a finger-wagging lesson for mocking the woman or scolding us all for fixating on our mobile screens.</description>

      <description>In a post this morning, James Franco Review founder Corinne Manning announced that she is stepping down from the Review after the next issue, which launches on November 1st, and that Monica Lewis will be taking over as publisher, with current managing editor Nicole McCarthy staying on in her current role. Further, the publication will be changing its name. (The new name has not yet been announced.)
The name change is probably a good idea.</description>

Autumn in literary Seattle brings with it an abundance of choice. Any given night offers at least three decent options for literary events to attendâmany of them entirely free.It would be a great problem to have if it didnât mean you missed so much fun thanks to the overstuffed readings schedules. October and November pass blithely through when-it-rains-it-pours territory and skate directly into a monsoon.
Case in point: this Saturday night delivers not one but two comics anthology debut parties.</description>

Yesterday, [Artist Trust announced](http://artisttrust.org/index.php/news/press-release/artist_trust_invests_91000_in_61_artist_projects_across_washington_state) it was supporting 61 Washington state visual artists, musicians, and writers with its Grants for Artist Projects (GAP) Awards. This year&#39;s awards amounted to $91,000 in total, with most of the artists getting $1,500 each toward their latest projects. One of those GAP winners was Seattle-based cartoonist Noel Franklin. We talked with her over email about the award, her (relatively brief) career as a cartoonist, and what she&#39;s working on next.</description>

So, the 2015 Washington State Book Awards were granted and celebrated on October 8, though I fear some will be no happier with the winners than they were with the list of finalists.</description>

      <description>Polygon tufts
kitely incurved
hood the fir cones from
rainfall. They respond
by closing tight
like the armadillo married the ent
and gave birth to
convex reflections of skylight
bursting chrome.
No slither for the deluge
the fir cones may now ripen
a living piece of architecture.
And when the branches shed,
the needles burn in captivity,
in ceremony,
to bless and protect
continuum.</description>

AlcalÃ¡&amp;rsquo;s exploration of food, land, and family, focusing on her home on Bainbridge Island, is an exploration of the things it takes to create a home and sustain it over generations.
It&amp;rsquo;s thanks to sponsors like the University of Washington Press, and readers like you, that we&amp;rsquo;re able to keep the pixels lit up here at the Seattle Review of Books.</description>

      <description>On Friday night at Fred Wildlife Refuge, Hugo House events coordinator Peter Mountford thanked a big crowd of people for joining the House in what he called Hugotory âÂ the purgatory period between Hugo Houseâs demolition and reconstruction, when the nonprofit writing center is hosting events in many different venues around town. Fred Wildlife is a terrific venue for the Houseâs Literary Series: the room feels at once large and intimate, and thereâs something about a chandelier to make a reading feel extra-classy.</description>

      <description>In the nearly five decades that Louis Collins has been selling books, heâs seen the book business completely transform itself. âI started off cataloguing books, sending out-of-print and hard-to-find books, mostly to institutionsâ out of his office in San Francisco he tells me. âIn those days before the internet there was a magazine called the AB Bookmanâs Weekly,â which served as a marketplace of rare and out-of-print books and a central meeting-place for the used bookselling community.</description>

Later that day, *Seattle Review of Books* co-founders Martin McClellan and Paul Constant had a conversation on Slack about whether music should be included in the same context as literature. That conversation turned into an exploration of what literature can (and possibly canât) do.</description>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s been another banner week in the history of our great republic. The democratic process has never seemed so&amp;hellip;well, uh. Yeah.
Maybe the appropriate way to close out your workweek, then, is to listen to KUOW&amp;rsquo;s Elizabeth Austen and Marcie Sillman introduce Karen Finneyfrock&amp;rsquo;s poem &amp;ldquo;The Newer Colossus,&amp;rdquo; which is written from the perspective of the Statue of Liberty. Finneyfrock&amp;rsquo;s version of Liberty is weary. She&amp;rsquo;s seen too many anti-immigration hypocrites, from her island.</description>

      <description>Jean Riley wrote a great roundup of the state of independent bookselling in Seattle for Seattle Magazine.  The past few decades have been challenging for independent bookstores, with each decade seeming to bring on a new threat: First, there were the huge chains that dominated the retail landscape. Then, there was the shift to online shopping, followed by the invention of electronicâreading devices. And now, the entry of Amazon into brick-and-mortar territory with its first store in Seattle.</description>

      <description>Unlike a lot of male superhero comics readers of my generation, Iâve never been a fan of the Punisher. I always preferred my superheroes to be aspirational. Murdering criminals in the street is something that only criminals do. The Punisher, to me, has always demonstrated the ugly, conservative side of superheroes, where the bad guys are an otherâmonstrous, irredeemable, worthy of nothing but scorn.
Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillipsâs new comic Kill or Be Killed is a series about a vigilante who kills criminals, but itâs not a Punisher-style glorification of the genre.</description>

      <description>Look, I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna get into a fight over Bob Dylan. But Bob Dylan is inarguably world-famous. Books and countless articles have been written about Bob Dylan&amp;rsquo;s genius. Bob Dylan has won an obscene number of awards. He&amp;rsquo;s made a lot of money.
And I&amp;rsquo;m just saying: Joan Didion still does not have a Nobel Prize in Literature. Or Claudia Rankine. Or Marilynne Robinson. If this was the year for an American to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, seeing one of those names in all the news reports would have made my morning a much happier one.</description>

      <description>Maybe this election cycle, with its casual invocation of nuclear war and portraits of American landscapes as dystopian nightmares, will finally break the fever of apocalyptic fiction that has held a tight grip on Americaâs popular consciousness for well over a decade now. Maybe â and this is one of those predictions that will likely sound very dumb six months from now â maybe itâs time to think about a better future again.</description>

      <description>If youâve attended a meeting of the Seattle City Council over the last few months âÂ as part of the #BlocktheBunker movement, say, or as a worker fighting for secure scheduling â odds are good youâve heard at least one poet read their work aloud. As part of her role as Seattleâs very first Civic Poet, Claudia Castro Luna curates the poetry readings that open City Council meetings. To many who attend council meetings on official business, this is probably just a bit of pointless civic nonsense to tolerate, some grandstanding to keep the arts community placated.</description>

      <description>We caught wind of this event too late for tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s reading calendar, but it&amp;rsquo;s too cool not to mention. The 2016 Taste of Iceland festival is happening this week, and it features a free reading at KEXP&amp;rsquo;s brand-spanking new headquarters (472 1st Ave. N) on Friday, October 14th. Iceland is one of the most literary nations on earth, with more authors per capita than anywhere else, and it&amp;rsquo;s got a long, rich and unbroken tradition of literature that you should learn more about.</description>

Collins has been selling books out of this building for decades, and heâs been in the book business for nearly 50 years. Since he does most of his business online, Louis Collins Books is only open for browsing by appointment. Iâd urge you to make an appointment: itâs a beautiful space, completely taken over by used and rare books.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Fantagraphics Books published a page called &amp;ldquo;The Truth About Pepe.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s an attempt to reclaim cartoonist Matt Furie&amp;rsquo;s character Pepe the frog from the racist so-called &amp;ldquo;alt-right&amp;rdquo; Trump supporters who have adopted the cartoon frog as an in-joke, a meme, and as a cultural signifier. Pepe has since been identified as a hate symbol. Fantagraphics says:
Having your creation appropriated without consent is never something an artist wants to suffer, but having it done in the service of such repellent hatred â and thereby dragging your name into the conversation, as well â makes it considerably more troubling.</description>

      <description>The J. Peterman catalog is a seminal 1990s artifact. The catalogs, which featured expensive vintage-style clothing from far-flung locales rendered in hand-drawn illustrations, were best known for their overwritten catalog copy. The text had an upscale, worldly air, and it almost always skittered on the line of self-parody, relaying adventures in foreign lands with language that was at once self-important and wildly entertaining, overblown and amusing.
Hereâs a sample of a J.</description>

The first of what is sure to be many Seattle-area periodicals trying to fill the void left by shuttered comics anthology Intruder has arrived, accompanied by a fart noise. The first issue of Fart Magazine, edited by Mark Allender, includes contributions from Intruder contributors like Marc Palm and Seth Goodkind.
Unlike Intruder, Fart isnât an all-comics joint; magazine-like, it features text pieces (essays from contributors like Emmett Montgomery and Elicia Sanchez) and a celebrity interview (with comedian Brian Posehn).</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re not aware of the @manwhohasitall Twitter feed, I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to follow it. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple premise â reversing the gender on common ignorant sexist statements â that pays off in so many enjoyable ways. Some examples:
&#34;Men shouldn&#39;t run for president because of their hormones,&#34; says male CEO, Paul, 60. Interesting that this comment comes from a man. &#34;I don&#39;t mind being called a gentleman driver because it&#39;s true, I&#39;m a gentleman and I&#39;m a driver.</description>

The executive director of the Kansas City library system says he is &#34;outraged&#34; that prosecutors continue to pursue charges against a man who was arrested after asking pointed questions during a library discussion about the Middle East peace process and an employee who tried to intervene. </description>

Wednesday October 5th: Rolling Blackouts Reading
With her ear for powerful, personal stories, new-to-Seattle cartoonist Sarah Glidden is the finest journalist to hit comics since Joe Sacco first put pen to paper. Her latest book, Rolling Blackouts, is a powerful piece of reportage that investigates what the Iraq War was like for ordinary people in the Middle East.

      <description>So far as travel resources go, the website Atlas Obscura isnât stodgy like Frommerâs, and itâs not overly obsessed with shopping like Lonely Planet guides. Instead, itâs interested in bizarre destinations and singular geographical points of interest: on their site right now, youâll find offers to visit Icelandic sorcerers who perform âevil-riddingâ ceremonies and a map marking the homes of heroes of childrenâs literature including Beverly Clearyâs Portland-based Ramona Quimby.</description>

      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s Nobel Prize for literature will be announced on October 13th, which is later than usual for weird calendar reasons. This piece at The Local says the betting markets think Haruki Murakami is a favorite to win the prize this year. Since Philip Roth retired, Haruki Murakami has always topped the betting markets, and â spoiler alertÂ â he has never won the Nobel Prize. (Neither has Roth, for that matter, and he was the favorite for at least a decade before Murakami took over the position.</description>

      <description>Last week, I shared the news that a new California law was going to require vendors in the business of selling collectibles to provide certificates of authenticity. I linked to a post by a California bookstore arguing that the law was going to be difficult â if not impossible â to obey.
But the law blog Scrivener&amp;rsquo;s Error sets that bookstore straight: seems that the California law is much more reasonable than the booksellers believed.</description>

      <description>I did not see her in flight or morning.
I did not stand her harps or trumpets.
or anything in my getting up day.
I traded the dreams we made on the ground
for my dream to be a god in the sky
(It was a guilded Gethsemane).
Hell is immortality without a net.
Immortality is a moon that never sets
after a million Sunday suns.

      <description>1. Journalism is the pursuit of truth. 
In 2010, cartoonist Sarah Glidden accompanied two reporters from the Seattle Globalist as they traveled through Iraq and Syria on a two-month trip. The Globalist reporters were there to find and report on as many stories as possible. Glidden was there, more or less, to report on the Globalist reporters. Six years later, Gliddenâs full account of the trip has finally been published as a book titled Rolling Blackouts.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend, the New York Review of Books âÂ no relation â published a piece of reportage that supposedly outed the author behind the pseudonym Elena Ferrante. Considering that Ferrante is an international bestseller and a global literary sensation, this piece immediately became an internet phenomenon.
Iâm not going to link to the piece, and I recommend you do not read it. I have no interest in who Elena Ferrante really is, and I donât believe thereâs a single good reason why NYRB should have uncovered her name.</description>

      <description>Louis Collins has been selling used books out of a storefront on Capitol Hill since 1984. Itâs easy to miss âÂ Louis Collins Books is a squat building at the corner of 12th and Denny, with nothing but a small white sign to identify it. Though Collins comes in to the store nearly every afternoon, the store is only open by appointment, so you canât just wander in and check out the shelves of books visible from the street.</description>

      <description>My Son, the Prince of Fashion What a wonderful piece by Michael Chabon on his son Abe, and his love of fashion. This is one you want to stay around for the ending, but I found the whole thing so charming, honest, and beautifully written that reaching the end was no issue at all.
 Abe was just a kid who loved clothes. He loved talking about them, looking at them, and wearing them, and when it came to men&#39;s clothing, in particular the hipper precincts of streetwear, he knew his shit.</description>

If you&#39;re one of the more than 140,000 people doing time in a Texas state prison, you&#39;re not allowed to read books by Bob Dole, Harriet Beecher Stowe or Sojourner Truth. But you&#39;re more than welcome to dig into Adolf Hitler&#39;s &#34;Mein Kampf&#34; or David Duke&#39;s &#34;My Awakening.&#34; If this story makes you mad, maybe consider donating to Seattle-based nonprofit Books to Prisoners?</description>

Yesterday, I told you that In Other Words, the feminist bookstore featured in the TV show Portlandia under the fictional name Women &amp;amp; Women First, had put a &amp;ldquo;Fuck Portlandia&amp;rdquo; sign in its window, and when the Willamette Week reached out for comment, bookstore staff told the Week to &amp;ldquo;go fuck themselves.&amp;rdquo;
Now, In Other Words has written a post explaining the sign. Also titled &amp;ldquo;Fuck Portlandia,&amp;rdquo; the post makes a great case for why In Other Words doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to play by the show&amp;rsquo;s rules anymore:</description>

Thursday September 29th: Writing for a Cause
At a time when Donald Trump can block newspapers he doesnât like from covering his campaign, this is more relevant than ever: Journalists Muatasim Qazi, Frederica Jansz, and former Seattle PI reporter Mike Lewis will discuss censorship. Jansz and Qazi both came to US after facing censorship abroad, only to find new threats here.</description>

      <description>The Short Run Comix and Arts Festival has unveiled their schedule of events, and it&amp;rsquo;s a doozy. It begins next week at Elliott Bay Book Company with the launch party for Seattle cartoonist Sarah Glidden&amp;rsquo;s brand-new book Rolling Blackouts. I&amp;rsquo;ll be interviewing Glidden onstage about her book, which documents Glidden&amp;rsquo;s travels through Turkey, Syria, and Iraq with several reporters from the Seattle Globalist. I hope to see you at Elliott Bay next week, and I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll consider attending all the Short Run events over the next two months.</description>

      <description>I agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that Jonathan Hickmanâs series Secret Wars was a high point for Marvel Comics â it was the culmination of a time in which Marvel seemed to be doing new things with its superhero comics, exploring old concepts with fresh eyes. At roughly this time last year, Marvel Comics felt as though it was humming with possibility; as Marvel&amp;rsquo;s films came to dominate the blockbuster box office, the comics division seemed ready to move forward into a new age.</description>

      <description>The first time I encountered the ravaging effects of post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD was when my husband went into surgery for a rare cancer and came out without any memory of our life. He died on the table that night, but his body remained. He had an anoxic insult, a brain injury, and he lost much of the ability to remember what happened yesterday or ten minutes ago. And surprisingly, he lost something most didnât at first recognize was possible to lose in a cancer treatment &amp;mdash; the long-term memories of his life.</description>

      <description>Wave Books has, in a relatively short span of time, become the second best poetry publisher in the Seattle area. The best, in case youâre new to town, is Port Townsend nonprofit publisher Copper Canyon Press; given that theyâre probably the best poetry publisher in the country, thereâs no shame here in a second-place finish.
And besides, Copper Canyon and Wave Books traffic in very different styles of poetry. Copper Canyon publishes, for lack of a better word, traditional poetry, which is to say they publish poems with the structure and the heft of generations.</description>

      <description>Maria Sempleâs second novel, Whereâd You Go Bernadette, was an international bestseller, the kind of publishing phenomenon that would be difficult for anyone to replicate. (Iâve seen it on bestseller walls in bookstores all over the country and in airports all over the world.) Something about Sempleâs novel appealed to a huge swath of the reading population. Perhaps it had something to do with the title characterâs hilarious distaste for Seattle, which was at that time just becoming recognized as the most up-and-coming city in the country.</description>

      <description>In Ireland, librarians are protesting plans to fully automate a library. The only paid human staff in the library on a recent test run were on the security team. A library solely staffed by security guards is an incredibly depressing thought.
In other depressing library news: Linda Jacobson at the School Library Journal reports that more librarians are self-censoring their collections these days:
School libraries at all levels are more likely than they were eight years ago to place content labels on books or to have restricted sections for books containing mature content, a data comparison to a 2008 SLJ survey on collection development and self-censorship revealed.</description>

      <description>For over a year now we&amp;rsquo;ve been publishing poems by local writers every Tuesday (you can see them all on the archive page). Each poet recommends the next in a chain that has led us through some of the most fascinating corners of the Northwest poetry scene.
We wanted to take one week out of our schedule to look back, in appreciation to the poets who have shared their work with us, and in hopes that you might discover a piece or two that speaks to you that you may have missed the first time.</description>

      <description>Every presidential cycle has its losers â the zany dimbulbs like Herman Cain, the gallant nerds like Dennis Kucinich, the unloveable schmucks like Rick Santorum. You canât help but wonder when you watch these losers speak why, exactly, theyâre bothering to run for office in the first place. Donât they realize they canât win? Do they believe theyâre running for a greater cause?
Or maybe theyâre just that delusional â perhaps when they wake up and drag combs across their heads in a bathroom mirror in a Dayâs Inn outside of Des Moines, they see someone destined for the seat of power.</description>

      <title>Stephen King&#39;s murder has been canceled</title>
      <link>http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/stephen-kings-murder-has-been-canceled/</link>

      <description>Human fiction-factory James Patterson has announced that his November title, a mystery titled The Murder of Stephen King, has been canceled. Jackson McHenry at Vulture writes that Patterson announced the cancellation &amp;ldquo;after deciding that he did not want to cause King and his family &amp;lsquo;any discomfort&amp;rsquo; given that fans have reportedly &amp;lsquo;disrupted the King household in the past.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s true; considering that King has had several stalkers through the years, Patterson&amp;rsquo;s novel, in which a would-be murderer combines the techniques and characteristics of various King antagonists, seems in exceptionally poor taste.</description>

      <description>Well-versed in the contents of his shop and the world of books, a recommendation from David is a valuable gift. He went straight from high school to bookselling and has held his current position as caretaker of Lion Heart Book Store for 15 years. In a half-serious, half-joking tone (leaving the facts amusingly uncertain), he explained that his father offered him three choices after high school: heâd send him to vet school, send him to prison, or help him start a bookstore.</description>

      <description>What We&#39;re Saying When We Talk About Hillary Clinton&#39;s &#34;Likability&#34; Sady Doyle unpacks the gendered responses to the first woman to be a major party candidate.
 No, Hillary Clinton is not a flawless person &amp;mdash; or politician. You can complain about her secrecy, her hawkishness, or her husband all for good reason. But Clinton is, according to available biographical evidence, normal. Ordinary, even. Sheâs like countless women of her generation: Caught between the second wave of feminism and the marital norms of a pre-feminist age, driven to prove herself but cautious about seeming âpushyâ or radical, aspiring to lead the nation into the 21st century yet baffled by her own fax machine.</description>

      <description>As Jennifer Schuessler reported in the New York Times, the MacArthur Foundation announced their annual &amp;ldquo;Genius&amp;rdquo; grant winners yesterday. I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to see that the new list of &amp;ldquo;Geniuses&amp;rdquo; includes authors we&amp;rsquo;ve written about here at the Seattle Review of Books over the past year.
 Willie Fitzgerald wrote a review incorporating Claudia Rankine&amp;rsquo;s compelling poetry collection Citizen last year.
 The brilliant Maggie Nelson has been written about a few times here on the site, most notably in Cate McGehee&amp;rsquo;s splendid review of The Argonauts and Jennifer Bernstein&amp;rsquo;s review of, among other books, Nelson&amp;rsquo;s The Art of Cruelty.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you just fall in love with an artistâs work at first sight. That was what it was like for me reading the first issue of DCâs new Doom Patrol, which was published last week. I donât know where Nick Derington comes from, but that two-page spread he drew that opens the issue, with a long, narrow panel of protagonist Casey Brinke driving an ambulance, is this kind of a moment for me.</description>

      <description>It feels like these are end times that we are living in. Black men are being murdered by police with impunity. Nationalist movements reminiscent of pre-WWII era fascism are cropping up all over the world. And we have somehow all become willing participants in a surveillance state, happily carrying around devices that track our every movement, and enable us to share intimate details for the state and corporations to monitor and mine.</description>

      <description>Amor Towlesâs second novel, A Gentleman in Moscow, centers around Count Alexander Rostov, a wealthy member of the aristocracy who, in the early 1920s, finds himself on the wrong side of the Russian Revolution. For the crime of his wealth and upper-class roots, the Count is sentenced to live under house arrest in a cramped room tucked into the top of a grand Moscow hotel called the Metropol. And there he stays, for three decades.</description>

      <description>Flavorwire reports on a Publishers Weekly report on the publishing industry. The bottom line: &amp;ldquo;Publishing Makes &amp;lsquo;Little Progress&amp;rsquo; in Diversity, Remains Extremely White.&amp;rdquo; This is not good enough.
 And there&amp;rsquo;s more bad news in the PW report, including the fact that women in publishing are still paid less than men. Boo.
 This came in too late for me to add to the readings calendar this week, but you should be advised that the Words West reading series will take place tomorrow night at C&amp;amp;P Coffee Company in West Seattle.</description>

      <description>Art saves nothing
and this is not art
just words running
in lines, hoping to reach
redemption. Meanwhile
time is running&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;out
for bat and bee,
hippo and elephant.
Coral reefs are dying. Salmon,
once wild, breed in tubs.
Don&amp;rsquo;t put your hope in poems
that plot the putrid doings
of bankers, that bank
on Franz Marc&amp;rsquo;s red horses
gamboling and grazing,
as if we&amp;rsquo;d never learned
to fabricate glue from hooves.</description>

      <description>Congratulations to Sherman Alexie, who was nominated for his children&amp;rsquo;s book Thunder Boy Jr. in the Young Readers&amp;rsquo; Literature category. We loved the book (as did our resident six-year-old).
And now seems like a good time to announce: join us, Sherman Alexie, Robert Lashley, and EJ Koh at the Elliott Bay Book Company on November 11th for a poetry reading. Eagle-eyed viewers will recognize this as our Bumbershoot lineup. We felt the night was so magical, we wanted to recreate it outside of the ticketed bounds of the Bumbershoot arena.</description>

      <title>Why does Carl Phillips need the Washington State Book Award?</title>

      <guid>http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/why-does-carl-phillips-need-the-washington-state-book-award/</guid>
      <description>The truth is, he doesnât. In fact, Carl Phillips is confused about the controversy his nomination is causing among Washington state poets. When I spoke with Phillips this morning he mentioned his total surprise and delight when informed by his publisher that his book Renaissance was nominated for this yearâs Washington State Book Award. He went on to say that the book was submitted by his publisher, Farrar, Strauss &amp;amp; Giroux.</description>

      <description>Counterfactual history, or counterhistory, has its signature moves: Killing Hitler. Letting the other side win the war. Imagining a home for the Jewish people outside of Israel.
A prominent example of a Jewish-themed counterhistory is Michael Chabonâs The Yiddish Policemenâs Union, in which the U.S. government, instead of supporting the formation of the modern state of Israel, grants a temporary lease to the Jewish people for Alaskan territory. The novel follows a down-on-his-luck detective trying to solve a case at the cusp of the reversion of Alaska to the United States.</description>

      <description>Lion Heart Book Store houses an eclectic collection of volumes, keeping the shelves as interesting as their owner and visitors. The turnover is fast, too â titles come and go as everyone who visits finds something that intrigues them. The most popular books come from the fiction section, but people ask for a great variety of titles, editions, and genres. The mystery section is always well-stocked, with paperbacks stuffed into narrow shelves with no wiggle room.</description>

      <description>Edward Albee, Playwright of a Desperate Generation, Dies at 88 One of the great tragedies of a good obituary is that someone needs to die in order for it to be read. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a number of Albee plays, but knew very little about the man himself.
 Sent to an adoption nursery in Manhattan before he was three weeks old, baby Edward was placed with Reed Albee, an heir to the Keith-Albee chain of vaudeville theaters, and his wife, Frances, who lived in Larchmont, N.</description>

      <description>In case you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell from our diversity reports or our thoughts on the current discussion on cultural appropriation in fiction, we take issues of diversity seriously here at the Seattle Review of Books. We don&amp;rsquo;t always get it right, but we try. And we think it&amp;rsquo;s always important for Seattle&amp;rsquo;s literary community to keep issues of diversity in mind.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I want you to know about the second in a series of free workshops on racial equity in the literary arts that&amp;rsquo;s sponsored by Seattle: City of Literature.</description>

      <description>When I was young I worked at a vegetarian restaurant, The Morningtown, which ironically, opened on the day I was born. Ironic, because working there was kind of a birth of my adult self from my teenage self. I learned a lot.
Every day for lunch a nice young woman would come in and order black beans and rice and tahini. We made really good tahini. She never varied her order, but she was a valued regular who ate there every day.</description>

If you love books and you havenât read cartoonist Tom Gauldâs terrific collection Youâre All Just Jealous of My Jetpack, youâre missing out. The book is packed with clever riffs on genre and famous authors, demonstrating Gauldâs deep reading life and obvious wit. Heâs one of us, it announced to book nerds, and heâs not afraid to show it.
Gauldâs newest book, Mooncop, is totally different: itâs a single comics story, a(n admittedly slender) graphic novel that couldnât be more rhythmically opposed to the compact gags of Jetpack.</description>

      <title>On Lionel Shriver and cultural appropriation in fiction</title>

      <description>In a keynote speech at the Brisbane Writers Festival, novelist Lionel Shriver said, âI am hopeful that the concept of âcultural appropriationâ is a passing fad.â
Shriver listed a number of instances in which students on college campuses were offended by acts they deemed to be cultural appropriation. You are probably familiar with at least some of these examples; theyâve been employed ad nauseam by pundits and Facebook posters who want to rail against âcoddled millennialsâ or âPC culture run amokâ or whatever it is theyâre mad about today.</description>

Remember when Oprah chose Jonathan Franzenâs novel The Corrections for her book club and Franzen publicly chafed at the designation? The poor dear seemed to regret the mainstream success that came with Oprahâs seal of approval; Franzen called the books that Oprah liked âschmaltzy,â and the kiss of Oprahâs commercial approval caused him to preen over his wounded literary pride for a decade.
You will never see Colson Whitehead shying away from Oprahâs love for his latest novel, The Underground Railroad.</description>

      <description>Youâre either the kind of reader who digs books that have maps and family trees in the first few pages, or youâre not. Some readers â and for the sake of full disclosure, this is where my loyalties lie â tend to barrel through books all sharklike, never turning back or stopping. Others prefer to take their time; these are the people who love the luxury of flipping back and forth, consulting the character lists in the front of the book and thumbing over to the glossary in the back as needed.</description>

      <description>Thereâs been a lot of talk about the balcony railing lately. Is it up to code? Does it have a soul? What secrets does it hold? Does it have reality? Does it have anyone to blame but itself? What are we to do with it? Why does it have to appear at all? Personally, I donât really care. Itâs not our balcony. But as an external feature of the building we are to share in its fate and responsibility.</description>

      <description>Colson Whitehead never writes the same book twice. This is possibly why, despite the fact that heâs been the most consistently excellent novelist to be published by a mainstream New York house over the last two decades, he hasnât been able to build the audience that he deserves. In these times of fractured fandoms and increasingly algorithm-centric recommendations, people who enjoy Whiteheadâs personal, semiautobiographical novel might not even bother to try his zombie novel, and fans of his zombie novel might not think his gigantic examination of the American myth of John Henry is for them.</description>

      <description>On my second visit to Lion Heart Book Store, I overheard David entertaining a small audience with a story involving a large caterpillar on an expensive rug. Like with many customers, he remembered me and greeted me by name. Lion Heart Book Store is full of stories, but not only from Davidâs life and the books that surround him. Visitors seem eager to share their own stories: they tell him about their book collections, their jobs, their favorite novels, their pipe dreams.</description>

Framed: she was the pta mom everyone knew. who would want to harm her? Christopher Goffard&amp;rsquo;s absolutely bonkers, and incredible, six-part story from the LA Times, reproduced here in full, about people who do shitty things.
 They were outside Plaza Vista School in Irvine, where she had watched her daughter go from kindergarten to fifth grade, where any minute now the girl would be getting out of class to look for her.</description>

      <description>Eugene Kim at Business Insider writes:
Amazon is aggressively expanding its presence in the real-world retail market, with a plan to open dozens of new pop-up stores in US shopping malls over the next year, a source familiar with the matter told Business Insider. These stores mostly seem to be device sales locations, not bookstores. Meanwhile, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble&amp;rsquo;s founder and interim CEO calls the retail environment &amp;ldquo;one of the worst I have ever experienced in the 50 years I have been in this industry.</description>

Dear Cienna,
**I refuse to buy books from Amazon, either in physical or ebook format. The way they shut down bookstores was morally reprehensible.**

      <description>Margaret Atwood deserves the Nobel Prize for Literature. Sheâs written some of the best books written in English over the last fifty years and her range far surpasses most of her American contemporaries, stretching from science fiction to literary fiction and back again. Sheâs an underrated poet. And sheâs terrific on Twitter. So when Portland comics publisher Dark Horse announced that they would be publishing Atwoodâs first comic, Angel Catbird, in the fall of 2016, I was understandably excited.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we published our first report from our Public Diversity Editor, Vanessa Willoughby. As promised, we published it with minimal stylistic editing, all of which Vanessa approved before publication.
Why are we publishing a diversity report? It&amp;rsquo;s a question worth asking again, and the answer is simple: either you think that the world is just and that the inequalities experienced in our society (or, more acutely, in the publishing world) by people of color, women, and LGBT people are because of their inherent lesserness, or you accept that bias and privilege are real.</description>

Dean Wong has devoted his life to recording the Asian-American experience through photos and words. His latest book, from Seattle-area publisher of beautiful books Chin Music Press, is a tribute to Chinatowns all over North America. Wongâs interviews and portraits capture the spirit of community that makes Chinatowns from coast to coast more than just neighborhoods.

      <description>And so here we are, at the beginning of a shiny new fall. Fall is to the literary world what summer is to movie season: the season when the big names come out to play, when the big advertising budgets and media blitzes roll out. And every season, the books are accompanied with a certain amount of buzzâbook chat, both positive and negative, from agents, librarians, and other literary folks with early access to review copies.</description>

      <description>Almost half a year ago, we put out an [open call for a Public Diversity Editor](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/31/open-call-for-a-public-diversity-editor/). After fielding many responses, [Vanessa Willoughby accepted our offer](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/06/27/interview-with-our-new-public-diversity-editor/) to take the role. This is her first report. The demand for diversity in the publishing world has always been a priority for writers and readers of color. In the past few years, such misrepresentation has become a favorite talking point of media and industry figureheads alike without active solutions.</description>

      <description>Mary Ann Gwinn at the Seattle Times pays tribute to the Washington Center for the Book&amp;rsquo;s executive director, Chris Higashi. In her time at the Center and in conjuinction with the Seattle Public Library, Higashi has done more for reading and literature in this city than just about anyone. Now she&amp;rsquo;s retiring. It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely piece and you should read it.
Whoever takes Higashi&amp;rsquo;s position will be facing down a tremendous responsibility: leadership at the Seattle Public Library has not demonstrated a commitment to books and readings.</description>

      <description>Getting paid to travel, eat, and write seems like nothing short of the perfect job. Matt Gross, a foodie and born adventurer, held this job for years, immersing himself repeatedly in cultures all over the globe. Having written the Frugal Traveler column in the New York Times for several years, he has perfected the art of conveying a sense of place. The premise of his column was simple: travel somewhere, stick to a budget, and give readers tips on how to best experience the destination while living frugally.</description>

      <description>David welcomed me with a booming, melodic voice the second my foot crossed the threshold. He sings greetings to every visitor who enters Lion Heart Book Store. The space is crammed but tidy, with tables by the entrance and narrow spaces between the shelves. Laminated handwritten signs label the main sections, starting with childrenâs and YA books by the front door. As you move toward the back the signs take you to literature/poetry/plays and end in the $2 pocket mysteries section, always full of worn paperbacks.</description>

      <description>Inside the Federal Bureau Of Way Too Many Guns There are a lot of guns in this country. And obviously a lot of shootings. And the only way to trace a gun, as Jeanne Marie Laskas uncovers, is through an amazingly inefficient system reliant on thousands upon thousands of boxes filled with records. Also, computers and searchable digital files are not allowed. Laskasâ interviews with Charlie Houser and his team at ATF show the fascinating and overlooked side of gun tracing.</description>

      <description>Youâve seen this future before. Lucas Varelaâs new comic The Longest Day of the Future is stuffed full of familiar sci-fi tropes: future humans walk around their future cities wearing sexless jumpsuits, unless theyâre mad scientists in white lab coats and goggles. Aliens have giant skulls and fly around in saucers. Robots are comical figures with telescoping arms. Fleshy pink tentacles leap out at you when you least expect them. Portals enable instantaneous travel anywhere on Earth, and even into other dimensions.</description>

 &amp;hellip;I want to be read. I know I canât be âpopular,â and I regard this as a major failing&amp;hellip;but&amp;hellip;.[v]ery few people read me&amp;hellip;  Some might interpret this as writerly anxiety or false modesty because the work of few contemporary authors has as serious a readership among the literati.</description>

      <description>**Wednesday August 31: I Will Send Rain **
Rae Meadowsâ fourth novel, I Will Send Rain, is set against the backdrop of the mid-1930s dustbowl. Itâs the kind of impressive, intensely researched work that reinvigorates an authorâs career. Meadows shares the stage tonight with Seattle author Martha Brockenbrough, author of The Game of Love and Death. Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, elliottbaybook.comÂ . Free.

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1472077460758/bumbershoot.jpg)
During all the hoopla over Paul Allenâs Upstream Music Festival coming to Pioneer Square next year, I had to wonder why Allen didnât just invest in Bumbershoot instead. Two years ago, Bumbershoot found itself in real financial trouble, and One Reel, the non-profit organizer of the festival, had to partner with AEG Live, the (decidedly for-profit) concert promoter, to keep the festival afloat. This pairing has caused a lot of consternation from Bumbershoot fans.</description>

      <description>One day in the not-so-distant future, Americans will look back on the way we currently treat our prisoners with shame and regret. Over-incarceration abounds â particularly of African-American and Hispanic men â and rehabilitation is barely an afterthought. Drug crimes are still hugely over-represented (as of 2014, half of all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in prison were there due to the War on Drugs) and the race and class issues in our prison system are so glaringly obvious that to call them âsubtextâ would be insulting to the very concept of text.</description>

      <description>Just a reminder that we are very excited about the Seattle Review of Books showcase happening at Bumbershoot this Sunday at 7:30 pm. We&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting poets EJ Koh and Robert Lashley onstage with poet, novelist, short story author, and all-around Seattle literary lion Sherman Alexie. We hope to see you there.
 Wallingford&amp;rsquo;s wonderful Open Books closed yesterday and will remain closed for about two weeks because it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;transition time,&amp;rdquo; which means old owner John Marshall will be officially handing over ownership to Billie Swift.</description>

Your tortilla comal and family
pictures set in MichoacÃ¡n, zircon

caramelized on the branch. Fire left you

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re at all like me, you&amp;rsquo;ve stood in a record store and felt a sick pang in your gut as you realized that you don&amp;rsquo;t own a CD player anymore. SomehowÂ âÂ I blame hypnosis â computer manufacturers tricked us into giving up physical media in exchange for a few millimeters of laptop thinness. We&amp;rsquo;re not buying CDs anymore, we&amp;rsquo;re downloading our audio entertainment. And that goes for audio books, too.</description>

      <description>The Most Exclusive Restaurant In America Though exciting at first, this basement restaurant with a supposed years-long waitlist becomes gradually less legitimate the more you try to learn about it. Journalists canât confirm celebrity visits and numbers donât add up. Nick Paumgarten writes about his fifteen course meal with a stubbornly self reliant and secretive chef.

      <description>In the beginning of Suite VÃ©nitienne, Sophie Calle writes that for some unknown reason, she started choosing strangers at random on the street and following them without their knowledge. Sheâd take photos of them and write little notations tracking their movements. Then, her little game escalated:
At the end of January 1980, on the streets of Paris, I followed a man whom I lost sight of a few minutes later in the crowd.</description>

      <description>I first heard of Vice magazine while working at Borders. An achingly hip young man came into the store â it was the late nineties and my memory is foggy, but he was probably dressed like a rave had collided with a grunge music festival âÂ and asked me if we carried Vice. I said I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what Vice was. He explained that it was a cool free magazine distributed around major American cities, and that new issues disappeared as quickly as they arrived.</description>

      <description>You guys, I kind of hate myself for even writing this, but the new Flintstones comic book?
It&amp;rsquo;s pretty good.
I know, I know. I&amp;rsquo;ve complained at length about the way publishers have dredged up licensed properties for children and turned them into grim fantasias for psychically injured man-babies. But this is not that. This is something else again.
Let&amp;rsquo;s be clear up front that The Flintstones, as a premise, has always been completely nut-bustingly insane.</description>

      <description>I would just like to second Kelly Conaboy&amp;rsquo;s post on the Hairpin titled &amp;ldquo;Blog, You Idiots.&amp;rdquo; Not so long ago, blogging felt like a new and exciting form of communication: there was aggregation, yes, but there was also fresh short writing on a regular basis. And now blogging seems to be disappearing, and that&amp;rsquo;s very sad because it seems as though we&amp;rsquo;ve only just started to figure out the capabilities of blogging as an art form.</description>

      <title>Literary Event of the Week: Nevertold Casket Company Reading #1</title>

      <description>The Nevertold Casket Co. looks kind of like the cursed junk shop from Gremlinsâa store that proudly carries âhauntedâ merchandise which could add a conversation piece to your living room or rain down eternal torment on your household in the form of a vicious spirit of vengeance from feudal Japan. It is a shop, in other words, that is full of stories. The wax dummy of a baby covered in syphilis sores has to have an explanation behind it, right?</description>

      <description>Electric Literature cites a new study which &amp;ldquo;found that readers of literary fictionâââbut not commercial fictionâââhave a better understanding of other peopleâs emotions.&amp;rdquo;
Yeah, unless there&amp;rsquo;s a scientific method to determine the difference between commercial fiction and literary fiction, this sounds like bunk to me â the kind of easy study which enforces preconceived notions about art and commerce. But if there&amp;rsquo;s one damn thing the internet loves, it&amp;rsquo;s using scientific studies to enforce their own preconceived notions.</description>

      <description>My diaphragm left behind
A mind works funny when it comes to sex
important things crash
A fire wound takes everything away
Random acts of nature relentless
Internalized violence a fog
I killed the frog for science
What we love we destroy
Yesterday I was a sex machine
My warrior searching a way to spark
Internet recessions scare me
I wanted to sleep with him
but my diaphragm was lost</description>

Christy McDanold had shopped at Greenlakeâs Secret Garden Bookshop, although she wouldnât call herself a regular. But when in January of 1995 she got a notice from the store announcing a going-out-of-business sale, she decided to get into the bookstore business. Sheâd never owned, worked at, or even considered the economics of running a bookstore before, but throughout the winter and into the spring she kept âtalking and thinking about it.</description>

      <description>Davidâs Ankles: How Imperfections Could Bring Down the Worldâs Most Perfect Statue Salvaged from a weathered and awful piece of marble, Michelangeloâs David seemed like a miracle wrapped in layers of impossible perfection. But Sam Anderson reveals its cracks, scars, and blemishes, all overlooked in hopes that it will simply and luckily survive an impending Florentine disaster.
 The trouble is the Davidâs ankles. They are cracked. Italians first discovered this weakness back in the 19th century, and modern scientists have mapped the cracks extensively, but until recently no one claimed to know just how enfeebled the ankles might be.</description>

      <description>A rule of thumb for writing science fiction is to start with the world outside our window, change one thing, and then see how that affects the world. Often the thing thatâs changed is a technological breakthrough â faster-than-light travel, or nanomachines âÂ and sometimes itâs a societal shift, like talking animals. In Portland author David D. Levineâs Arabella of Mars, the one new thing is a physical law: there is no vacuum of space.</description>

      <description>M.A.Orthofer at the Literary Saloon notes that the New York Times has consolidated all of its book review coverage â in the daily paper and in the The New York Times Book Review âÂ under the purview of Pamela Paul. It&amp;rsquo;s perhaps easy to bemoan every new change in the world of journalism as a mistake, but, uh, I think this is a mistake.
One of the consistent pleasures of reading the New York Times was finding book reviews in the paper that disagreed with book reviews in the Book Review.</description>

      <description>Above all else, most superhero comics should aim to be entertaining. Sure, itâs nice if you get some commentary in there, or a little bit of a political message, but superheroes arenât the ideal messengers for heavy themes. (Sorry, people who think The Dark Knight Returns counts as deep political satire.) By the entertainment-per-page ratio, Portland author Chelsea Cainâs run on the Mockingbird series for Marvel is leading the superhero pack these days.</description>

      <title>Barnes &amp; Noble parts ways with new CEO</title>

      <description>This is not the first time this has happened:
Barnes &amp; Noble just unceremoniously ousted Ronald Boire as CEO, saying that the board has deemed him ânot a good fit for the organization and that it was in the best interests of all parties for him to leave the Company.â Boire was at the top of the chain book retailer for less than a year. This puts longtime Barnes &amp;amp; Noble leader Leonard Riggio back in charge of the chain that he founded in 1965 and has led, on-and-off, ever since.</description>

      <title>In 9 Ounces, Anastacia Renee Tolbert transforms monologues into conversations</title>

      <description>Luna, Alice, and Saraphina fill the stage with both humor and anguish. Three friends living in the same building, they work on their downward dog together and help each other through lifeâs daily struggles. The performance in 9 Ounces presented the separate monologues of these three black women â each one an act and each role performed by Anastacia Renee Tolbert, the Hugo House&amp;rsquo;s current poet-in-residence. In part, the characters serve to represent the span of life and its various stages through their age differences: Luna is a kid, Alice an adult, and Saraphina a 91-year-old widow.</description>

      <description>As you know, we at the Seattle Review of Books publish a poem by a Seattle poet every Tuesday at 10 am. We always ask the featured poet to then choose the poet who weâll feature on the next Tuesday. Itâs a chain of Seattle poetry, made up of friends, fans, and acquaintences whoâve shared some laughs on the open-mic circuit. When I asked Seattle literary demigod Sherman Alexie to kick off our spring/summer 2016 poetry chain, I was intensely curious to see who heâd choose as the poet to succeed him.</description>

      <description>Hunter S. Thompson&amp;rsquo;s widow, Anita, just returned a pair of antlers that Thompson stole from Ernest Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s house about three years after Hemingway committed suicide. This story touches on so many high school boy writer wannabe zones of interest that it&amp;rsquo;s not even funny: Thompson, Hemingway, theft, the ironic display of hunting trophies.
But let&amp;rsquo;s be clear so all the wannabe gonzo journalists in the back can hear us: stealing objects from the home of your idols is not okay.</description>

      <description>When I talked with cartoonist Ted Rall at Town Hall last year, he openly discussed his legal troubles with the Los Angeles Times. His side of the story is around the 28 minute mark in the video below:
 Basically, Rall says that the chief of the LAPD and the editors of the LA Times colluded to fire him. Rall filed a suit against the Times to clear his name, which means he&amp;rsquo;s now in direct combat with the much-loathed media conglomerate Tronc.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell.

Cold guy drifts in cold veins, this nightly swim.
So I overheard in LA, grab a shovel, LA is dead.
Nothing is Real. Lame,

Of life, if not for death&amp;rsquo;s warming the carpet living room.</description>

Sagging Meniscus Press has pulled together this first volume of Lisker&amp;rsquo;s collected stories: &amp;ldquo;We regard the publication of these stories, all together for the first time, as an important event in American letters.&amp;rdquo;
We have the start of his story &amp;ldquo;Amplitude of the Cosmos&amp;rdquo; on our sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page, and it&amp;rsquo;s wonderful work, complex, rhythmic, with a melodic rhyme and lilt, a formalist repetition that provides mood and music in the prose.</description>

      <description>In the news business, they refer to the &amp;ldquo;Friday evening news dump&amp;rdquo; as the time when organizations âÂ corporations, governments â release information that they don&amp;rsquo;t want to get much attention. Friday evenings at 5 pm in the summer are generally when disgraced CEOs step down, when embarrassing statistics are released, when institutional shame is released into the world. Friday news dumps in August and December are especially notorious for this, because absolutely nobody pays attention to the news over the weekends in summer or the holiday season.</description>

      <description>If youâve published a kidsâ book and you live in Seattle, the odds are good that youâve been to Secret Garden Books. Either youâve stopped by and introduced yourself because you know they have a rapt audience of children who pay close attention to their recommendations, or theyâve hosted your book launch party. The fact is, though Seattle is home to many terrific bookstore sections for young readers âÂ Elliott Bay Book Companyâs childrenâs section improved exponentially when the store moved from Pioneer Square to Capitol Hill; University Book Store has always had an incredibly diverse selection of titles and an adoring staff â Secret Garden is the cityâs headquarters for childrenâs literature.</description>

Near the beginning of a speech at the end of July, Donald Trump asked a hall full of people at the Air &amp;amp; Space Museum in Denver: âNow, you know, should we read âThe Snake?ââ The room erupted with cheers. Trump, playing coy, asked again: âShould we? Does anyone know âThe Snake?ââ This was met with more cheers. Ever shameless, Trump asked again, âshould we do it?â Still more cheers.</description>

      <guid>http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/are-question-based-headlines-a-bad-idea/</guid>
      <description>Yes. God, yes.
Question-based headlines prompt a more negative response from readers as well as a more negative expectation of the story that follows compared to traditional news headlines, showed a report published on 9 August by the Engaging News Project. Remember the rule of thumb: if the headline is a question, the answer is almost always &amp;ldquo;no.&amp;rdquo; Headline writing has, in recent years, transformed from an art form â a good headline is a piece of writing that communicates with the piece as well as promoting the piece â into an impossibly dry chunk of information.</description>

      <description>Midway through the first issue of The Black Monday Murders, a master of finance lectures a class full of eager young geniuses who are about to enter the stock market. He asks them, âyou want real advice? Here it is. The first million dollars you make is self-financed. You earn it with your blood. The cost is your health, your family, your friends. You pay, understand?â Itâs not quite as splashy as Gordon Gekkoâs âgreed is goodâ monologue from Wall Street, but itâs a speech that resonates with the same kind of honesty.</description>

      <description>Before Cody Walker left Seattle to teach English in Ann Arbor, he was frequently described as a quintessential Seattle poet. Go to any open mic night and youâll likely find some poet who doesnât even realize heâs aping Walkerâs schtickâan endearing blend of earnest and funny, formally inventive and respectful of tradition. For a time, Walker was a ringleader of the poetry scene, a funny and fun poet who was always willing to share the spotlight with up-and-coming Seattle writers.</description>

      <description>So billionaire Paul Allen has funded a very large and very successful art fair in Seattle. Nicole Brodeur at the Seattle Times just broke the news that next year, Allen is funding a very large music festival in Seattle.
So, uh, when is Paul Allen going to get around to funding a very large book festival in Seattle? Compared to those other two festivals, this one will be a bargain to put on.</description>

      <description>For decades, Peter Bagge has reigned as Seattleâs mightiest cartoonist. Heâs a high-functioning artist, which is to say that his work is strong in just about any way an artistâs work can be measured: heâs prolific, heâs stylistically fascinating, his comics are easy to read and well-written, he has a unique viewpoint, and his work has deepened over time. Though heâs been publishing work for over three decades now, Baggeâs best work â a biography of Margaret Sanger titled Woman Rebel âÂ was published in late 2013, and thereâs no sign that heâs slowing down in terms of output and quality.</description>

      <title>Remembering James Alan McPherson</title>

      <description>James Alan McPherson, acclaimed American writer and writing educator, died last month, at the age of 72.
McPherson is best known for his wide-ranging 1977 short story collection Elbow Room, which won the Pulitzer Prize. He had worked with and been mentored by Ralph Ellison, an author with a similar eye for the entrenched, neurotic small-mindedness of the American cultural landscape. But McPherson&amp;rsquo;s characters, navigating between situations of generous-minded realism and stark absurdity, are conveyed with a warmth that&amp;rsquo;s unique to him &amp;mdash; even when he&amp;rsquo;s skewering someone, it&amp;rsquo;s with affection.</description>

Iâm an insomniac, itâs a lifelong thing. And lesbian. Iâm sick when I say this, a little envious of a body that can fit through anything, a lifelong thing, steady hands but a little shaky otherwise, getting hurt in everyday ways, we joke about it, Iâm sensitive. Growing up together itâs years of tangled up arms or conversations and no one touches me as an on my own grown-up but for hugs and comings and goings or across my hair when Iâve just cut it, Iâve grown all arms and head.</description>

      <description>When I was a kid, I loved George R. R. Martin&amp;rsquo;s superhero anthology fiction series Wild Cards. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to get superheroes right in prose, but Martin&amp;rsquo;s dark and involved universe just felt perfect. (The comics adaptation of the books, as I recall, was terrible.) If you&amp;rsquo;re going on vacation later this month and you like sci-fi anthologies, grab a couple Wild Cards volumes before you go.
Well, now that Game of Thrones has taken over the universe, a Wild Cards TV series is in the works.</description>

      <description>Sponsor Isla McKetta spent a year in Poland, and it was that experience, and having spent a previous year in Pinochet&amp;rsquo;s Chile as a child, that made oppression a topic in the forefront of her mind. In her novel Polska, 1994 she explores that, through the eyes of Magda, who witnesses her mother&amp;rsquo;s arrest and disapearance.
We have a long sample on our sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page so you can experience McKetta&amp;rsquo;s tightly wrought language and ideas.</description>

 ![](/webhook-uploads/1470638973194/01.jpg)
 In a galaxy far, far away&amp;hellip; When I was growing up in rural Bedfordshire in the Eighties, there were fairly limited options for sci-fi action fans to get their fix. On TV, there were three &amp;mdash; then four &amp;mdash; channels that might show the odd Star Trek or Doctor Who episode.</description>

While our August Bookstore of the Month, Secret Garden Books, does host plenty of events in its Ballard storefront, most of the events on its robust readings calendar canât be attended by your average adult Seattleite. âWhat we do mostly with events is school visits,â Secret Gardenâs events manager Suzanne Perry tells me. She calls the school events âone of my favorite partsâ of the job, event though âwe donât publicize them and people donât know we do them.</description>

Snakes and guerrillas fill the jungle, but despite these perils, thousands of migrants from all over the world attempt to cross it in hopes of eventually reaching the US. Jason Motlagh faced the risks and trials of the journey leading up to and through the DariÃ©n Gap to document the experience.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read this Guardian story by Alison Flood about the situation in Turkey, please do so:
President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄanâs government used a state of emergency law to close the 29 publishing houses last week, along with a swath of newspapers, television channels, magazines and news agencies. According to the Turkish Publishers Association, the decree means that all goods, assets, rights, documents and papers belonging to the publishers will be transferred free of charge to the Turkish treasury, with no appeal to be made, and the prospect of further publishers being shut down in the future.</description>

      <description>The first time I read Things Fall Apart it was a rushed high school read, just another item in a long list of assignments. The second time, in a compelling college class about postcolonial literature, we deliberately dissected every chapter, line, and Igbo word. In a different English class about trauma, we read Chimamanda Ngozi Adichieâs Half of a Yellow Sun, which paints a wild, tragic portrait of the Nigerian civil war from 1967-1970.</description>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1470281060333/coin-op6.jpg)
Last year, I wrote about Coin-Op, a wonderful comic series by the brother-sister team of Peter and Maria Hoey. The sixth issue of Coin-Op, titled âThe Last Great Time,â was published earlier this summer, and itâs official: Coin-Op is the most wonderful new comic series you havenât heard about yet.
When theyâre not working on their comics, the Hoeys are animators and film buffs, and most of âThe Last Great Timeâ is given over to an exploration of film history, in the form of brief comics essays about Luis BuÃ±uel and Nicholas Ray, with guest appearances from Jimmy Stewart, James Dean, Lauren Bacall, Natalie Wood, Alfred Hitchcock, Jim Jarmusch, and many more.</description>

      <description>As I said yesterday, I am loving the newfound attention Colson Whitehead is receiving. If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with Whitehead&amp;rsquo;s work, this interview with Jennifer Schuessler of the New York Times is a great way to learn about him.
He mentioned a bookstore owner from the South who invited him to come down for âa frank talk about race.â
âIâm honored by the response to the novel, but I was like, âCan we just talk about the book?</description>

      <description>Jekeva Phillips is a force of nature. Sheâs a writer who also performs improv, and a couple years ago she created her own magazine, Word Lit Zine, from thin air. For her next trick, sheâs devised her own three-day festival, Bibliophilia, which combines her love of theater and literature into a cross-disciplinary storytelling celebration.
Bibliophilia is made up of five events taking place on August 4th, 5th, and 6th at the Pocket Theater in Greenwood.</description>

      <description>I use a trick to teach students
how to avoid passive voice.
Circle the verbs.
Imagine inserting âby zombiesâ
after each one.
Have the words been claimed
by the flesh-hungry undead?
If so, passive voice.
I wonder if these
sixth graders will recollect,
on summer vacation,
as they stretch their legs
on the way home
from Yellowstone or Yosemite
and the bywayâs historical marker
beckons them to the
site of an Indian village &amp;mdash;</description>

We quoted Vlad from Third Place Books, who praised &amp;ldquo;Whiteheadâs unflinching exploration of the various manifestations of the economics of slavery.&amp;rdquo;
Today, Oprah added her approval to the chorus of booksellers and librarians by adding the novel to her Oprah&amp;rsquo;s Book Club label. &amp;ldquo;The September issue of O, The Oprah Magazine (available Aug.</description>

On our sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page we have the prologue and first chapter, so you can read enough to discover that this is indeed a book you want to invest in.</description>

      <description>Slate&amp;rsquo;s Isaac Chotiner asks Jonathan Franzen if he&amp;rsquo;s ever considered writing a book about race:
I have thought about it, butâthis is an embarrassing confessionâI donât have very many black friends. I have never been in love with a black woman. I feel like if I had, I might dare. Is there a word for when self-parody becomes the self? Is Jonathan Franzen the Donald Trump of the literary world?</description>

      <description>The first sentence of Bush, Jean Edward Smithâs biography of George W. Bush, obliterates any pretense of objectivity: âRarely in the history of the United States has the nation been so ill-served as during the presidency of George W. Bush.â The sentence is bracing, somehow â even shocking. We expect our presidential biographers to speak in hushed, respectful tones, partly out of deference to the power of the office and partly because presidential biographies are such dense works demanding so much research that a biographer can suffer from a kind of Stockholm syndrome, developing a fond personal connection that dulls the edge of any criticism.</description>

      <description>Founded in Green Lake by childrenâs book author Nancy White Carlstrom in 1977 â sheâs best-known for the Jesse Bear series â Secret Garden Books moved to 15th Ave NW in Ballard before eventually settling in to its current location on Market Street. Secret Garden has always been known first and foremost as a childrenâs bookstore, but when New York bookseller Susan Scott moved to town after over a decade at fabled NYC store Books &amp;amp; Co, she took over the buying and brought in what staffers delightfully refer to as âgrownup books.</description>

They cited a very simple reason: &amp;ldquo;the gross sales for at least this retail store no longer cover the overhead to allow continued operation.&amp;rdquo; They continue:
 Our last day of operations will be Saturday, August 27 and we have a celebration planned, so please join us.</description>

      <description>The subtle art of translating foreign fiction This collection of interviews by Rachel Cooke provides an interesting insight to translatorsâ thoughts, writing processes, and how they became translators. Some think of translation as its own art, while others adhere to the original text as best they can.
 There is no such thing as a literal translation â languages are entirely different systems and you canât impose Spanish on English or vice versa.</description>

As I said, political conventions are stories. They are narratives through which political parties explain America to America.Last weekâs Republican National Convention was a straight-up horror story, a nightmare scenario in which America was under continuous and merciless attack from alien forces both without and within. Donald Trump painted himself as the one man standing between life as we know it and total destruction. it was a childâs morality tale, a binary-minded nightmare lullaby of âwinnersâ and âlosers,â of âgood guysâ and âbad guys,â of âAmericaâ and âreal America.</description>

      <description>On his 45th birthday, Chris is on the cusp of a few different disasters, each one more mundane than the last. His mother died, so heâs moved in with his ailing father. His body seems to be falling apart all at once. Heâs been the music editor at a starving alternative weekly (the latest issue is just 28 pages, which in alt-weekly terms is basically a death sentence) for at least two decades, so his employability is questionable at best.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Hugo House published the lineup of their 2016-2016 Word Works and Literary Series events.
The Literary Series, which pairs writers and musicians to produce new work on a theme includes authors like TÃ©a Obrecht, Alexander Chee, Megan Kruse, and Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore and musicians including beautiful Seattle-based electronic act Crater. Word Works is bringing authors like Patricia Smith (who kicked ass the last time she read at Hugo House,) Lidia Yuknavitch, and â perhaps most excitingly âÂ Mary Gaitskill, who is one of the most underrated literary novelists in America today.</description>

Itâs been one year today since Paul and I launched the Seattle Review of Books, and it is my solemn duty to report to you that the state of the site could not be stronger.
In this past year, weâve run 120 book reviews, about 2.25 per week on average. We have paid 85 writers, journalists, and poets to bring insightful critique, remarkable poetry, reports from corners of the book world, and the occasional tough look at local issues.</description>

      <description>Wednesday July 27: Xinjiang and the Modern Chinese State Reading
To hear Donald Trump tell it, China is supposedly that weird blob on the other side of the world that keeps screwing us with trade. For a more nuanced view, perhaps you should turn to Seattle native Justin Jacobs, who will debut his new book about the rise of China as a ânational empire.âUniversity Book Store, 4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, http://www2.</description>

      <description>Of course, there was no such thing as a midnight Harry Potter party when the first book in J.K. Rowlingâs Harry Potter series was released in the United States back in 1998. I was a bookseller at a Borders when Harry Potter and the Sorcererâs Stone debuted, and the books gradually gained attention thanks to a word-of-mouth campaign spurred by the bookâs popularity in Britain and a succession of breathless media reports ranging from newspapers to NPR to daytime talk shows.</description>

      <description>What is it about orphans and literature? Why do so many narratives so dearly love a parentless child, from Moses to the novels of Dickens on down to Batman? On an instinctual level, it seems obvious: parents are shorthand for comfort, and security, and rules, which are three elements that are not conducive to great storytelling. And nothing hypnotizes some readers like the myth of the self-made man, the protagonist who truly doesnât need anyone else.</description>

      <description>The introductory letter in the brand-new 5th issue of the online literary magazine Moss begins, &amp;ldquo;our team has grown substantially since our last release,&amp;rdquo; welcoming &amp;ldquo;five new contributing editors.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s not readily apparent when reading the issue, which feels like the issues that have come before, but that&amp;rsquo;s what you want in a staff expansion: unless your publication is suffering an existential crisis, editorial shifts are generally best felt only subtly.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s great when the received narrative gets disrupted, and Oren Teicher, the CEO of the American Booksellers Association (ABA), has heard more than his share during his long tenure at the independent bookstore trade group, where he&amp;rsquo;s been the boss since 2009 and in other positions before that. The story that is told, news cycle after news cycle, is that indies were always just about to be wiped off the face of the country because of a new challenge.</description>

      <description>Thereâs this vessel I feel
the presence of all the time. My sister-

of silver beneath her tongue
which is one way to manage. For my own
part I envy the wooden pencils
shot through with graphite, deveining
themselves to the end of every line.
But for the stenographers
everyone do your own typing
seemed a sensible and leveling measure.
They still have their secret alphabet</description>

      <description>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, surely familiar now with adoring internet coverage of her dissents, her turns of phrase, her fancy collars, her meme status, made headlines earlier this month in a new and entirely surprising way: She was chastised widely by those on the right and the left for impropriety, after criticizing Donald Trump in interviews. For someone whose status as a hero and internet star is just a few years old, and whose prior reputation was as someone quiet, moderate, and exceedingly proper, this must have been an odd reversal.</description>

      <description>This month, Iâve been asking booksellers to name their summer reading picks. Itâs been delightful. But the problem with asking booksellers about books they recommend for the summer is that most of them are likely already reading books that will be coming out this fall. Librarians and booksellers are often months ahead on the new-release front.
When I asked Vlad at Third Place Books for his favorite summer read, he selected Danielle Duttonâs Margaret the First, which Frances Chiem wrote about for the Seattle Review of Books when it was published in April of last year.</description>

      <description>Iâm With The Banned This piece is terrifying and I admire Laurie Penny for experiencing this. Milo Yiannopoulosâ joie de vivre comes from the tsunami-sized waves of attention he receives. Whether itâs good or bad attention is unimportant. Being banned from Twitter is great news for those he abuses and offends, but itâs seemingly even better news for Milo because the spotlight is his once more. So itâs technically a win-win, but infuriatingly so.</description>

      <description>San Diego Comic Con is happening right now, and most of the stories coming out of the convention could just as easily be press releases. But when you get that many creative people in one space at one time, interesting things will happen. For instance, Seattle author G. Willow Wilson gave the first public reading from her upcoming second novel, The Bird King. Rich Johnston at Bleeding Cool writes:  Wilson treated her audience to a reading of the first chapter of *The Bird King*.</description>

Political conventions are stories. Every four years, the two major political parties come together in conventions to tell us stories about America. These stories are almost always told in three parts: where we came from as a nation, whatâs happening to us now, and finally, where weâre going.
The interesting part of collaborative storytelling is that when more than one person gathers to tell a story, that story becomes a living force, with its own agenda.</description>

Carla Hayden is the 14th Librarian of Congress! But, more importantly, she&amp;rsquo;s the first female and first black Librarian of Congress &amp;mdash; the thirteen before her have all been white men. Also, she&amp;rsquo;s actually a librarian (with a doctorate in library science from U Chicago), which hasn&amp;rsquo;t been the case since the 70s.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite things about Seattle novelist Matt Ruff is how his fans seem to be evenly split on their favorite book of his. Each of his books are so different from all the others that his fans have split into fiefdoms. Some prefer Fool on the Hill. Others have fallen hard for his newest, Lovecraft Country. The one that&amp;rsquo;s most satisfying for me is Set This House in Order.</description>

      <description>We use a modified Chicago style here on the Seattle Review of Books. Recently, editing a piece that used the term âebookâ sparked a discussion over which was better: âe-bookâ or âebookâ? To our eyes, âe-mailâ seems antiquated (we use âemailâ), but are electronic books different? They are more modern, after all. If we have to designated something as electronic, as opposed to analog, is the hyphen still necessary?
Help us decide.</description>

      <description>Sam Hendersonâs Magic Whistle comic recently transitioned from a one-cartoonist show to a humor anthology comic, and itâs very much been a delight. But you should know that the latest issue, number 3.2 âÂ no, I have no idea what kind of numbering system heâs working on â opens with a comic that every Seattleite should read.
Seattle cartoonist Tom Van Deusenâs six-page strip âBezosâ opens with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos pouring himself a coffee in a nice-but-not-extravagant kitchen.</description>

      <description>This morning, APRIL Festival co-founder Willie Fitzgerald introduced us to the idea of Poetweet, a website that searches your Twitter feed and turns it into a poem. (The site is a very clever promotion for the B_arco Cultural Center in Brazil.) I ran the Seattle Review of Books Twitter feed through, and here&amp;rsquo;s what happened:

      <description>**Wednesday July 20: *Remembering Healing Celebrating* **
Five Seattle-area poets â Priscilla Long, Jack Remick, Holly Hughes, John Wright, and Bethany Reid âÂ read new work about âthe past, lost poets, extinct birds, lost loves, and extending and expanding the meanings of elegy.â One of the top three best uses of poetry is remembering. (The other two? Sex and jokes.) * Third Place Books Ravenna, 6504 20th Ave NE, 525-2347 http://thirdplacebooks.</description>

      <title>Literary Event of the Week: Donald Ray Pollock at Elliott Bay Book Company</title>

      <description>You can pinpoint the origins of Donald Ray Pollockâs literary genius directly to a town in Ohio called Knockemstiff. Pollock was born and raised there, and he worked in a nearby paper mill for three decades. With a population just under 60,000, Knockemstiff is the kind of town that you donât typically find in contemporary American literary fiction; half-rotten by meth, starved for hope, and entirely broke, itâs about as far away from the world presented in Jonathan Franzenâs novels as you can imagine.</description>

      <description>In a month âÂ hell, a year âÂ loaded down with bad news, I urge you to read Seattle author Nicola Griffith&amp;rsquo;s triumphant blog post celebrating an exciting new literary award:  I did that. Me. [A global $50,000 prize to support stories about women](https://halftheworld.media/blog/winner-announced-half-world-global-literati-award-2016-canadian-author-laurie-petrou-recipient-inaugural-us50000-international-award/)âby writers from nearly 60 countriesâhappened because I wrote one blog post about something thatâs bugged me for years: that books about women donât win awards.</description>

      <title>The one where we talk about books and sitcoms</title>

      <description>More than ten years after going off the air, NBCâs sitcom Friends still enjoys an enormous influence in popular culture. Itâs still regular grist for Buzzfeed, itâs still Taylor Swiftâs favorite show, and last year Netflix reportedly dropped around $120 million for streaming rights. Like the Clintons and boy bands, itâs an artifact of the nineties that, for better or worse, stuck around.
No doubt Chandler, Joey, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel, and Ross owe their longevity to an ingenious alchemy of marketing and lifestyle branding.</description>

      <description>Weâre on a roof taking in the view. You
throw something over the edge. You donât know
how to count into a million pieces. You donât
know that gone is defined by what you still have
to live with. You want to see where it went
and itâs my job to tell you these things
so I show you, my shoulders and hands tightening
as I bend us into that irrevocable space.</description>

      <description>Sponsor John Whittier Treat&amp;rsquo;s novel The Rise and Fall of Yellow House was a 2015 Lambda Literary Award finalist for best Gay Novel, and he&amp;rsquo;s here to show an excerpt and make sure you&amp;rsquo;re aware of the book. It&amp;rsquo;s 1983, and Jeff has fled New York, and the beginning of the AIDS crisis, to Seattle and here meets Henry, who is fighting his own demons. Their love, and the middle-aged divorcee Nan who has opened her house to gay men in crisis, form the center of this moving work.</description>

      <description>For better or worse â and I would say for better, and worse â thereâs only one city thatâs truly felt like home to me, and thatâs San Francisco. The first time it felt this way was in 1994, and that had a lot to do with JoAnne. We taught each other to breathe and to chew, basic survival skills that we didnât have because we had to survive, Iâm quoting my first novel here, so you see how fiction can offer the truth, I donât have to use quotation marks because I wrote it.</description>

      <description>Every Monday in the month of July, weâll talking to Seattle-area booksellers about the books theyâre most excited to read this summer. Christina at Ravenna Third Place Books has the perfect book for your summer vacation: The Winged Histories by Sophia Samatar. As a fan of speculative fiction and high fantasy, Christina says Histories brings something new to the genre, âa response to tropes of the fantasy genre that tend to go unexamined, like the glory of warfare or toxic masculinity or colonial oppression and things like that.</description>

      <description>The Suit That Couldnât Be Copied Akhil Sharma tracks his attempt to copy one of Davide Taubâs suits, crafted so excellently they even âsuggest a controlled intelligence.â Sharmaâs piece is surprisingly fascinating and sheds light on various aspects of being a designer on Savile Row.
 When I saw Taubâs clothes, I was struck with desire. I have always dressed like a schlub; to do otherwise feels like competing to make myself attractive, which feels like setting myself up for humiliation.</description>

I havenât played PokÃ©mon Go, but the idea of augmented reality has intrigued me for quite some time, and so Iâm glad itâs finally here. More than virtual reality, augmented reality strikes me as something that might transform the way we interact with technology, and the way we interact with the world. To my noviceâs eye, itâs an interface as fresh and as exciting as the first iPhone was.</description>

      <description>Hooray for Dr. Carla D. Hayden! As of yesterday, she&amp;rsquo;s officially the 20th Librarian of Congress and, as Shelf Awareness notes, she&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;the first woman, and the first African American, to serve as chief executive of the Library of Congress.&amp;rdquo;
 This Vulture profile of Helen DeWitt is definitely worth your time. And if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read her long-out-of-print novel The Last Samurai, it&amp;rsquo;s available again in finer bookstores everywhere.</description>

      <description>KUOW reporter Marcie Sillman filed a piece this morning about a new book conservation program at the University of Washington:
More than 10,000 items flow through the center every year; everything from fragile maps that need protective casings to books with torn bindings. Most of the binding work is outsourced to commercial binderies, but in-house conservators tend to the rare books, pamphlets and other delicate materials. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wondered about the preservation of books, this is very much worth your time.</description>

      <description>The thing about writing a Superman story, I remarked a few months ago after watching the dreadful Batman V Superman movie, is that the conflict should be based in exploring the concept of morality. All the superheroic trappings â the laser eyes, the flight, the strength â are basically just window-dressing. This is why Superman is a character who easily splinters into many different personalities: when the character famously died in the 1990s, he âreturnedâ as four distinct characters, each with their own variation on the Superman theme, and each with their own spin on what it means to be a moral person.</description>

      <description>Jason Weisberger writes about a San Francisco Little Free Library that was targeted by some vandals. This is, of course, outrageous and I&amp;rsquo;m glad they keep putting the Library back up.
However, I have noticed that we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a flood of Little Free Libraries in Seattle over the last year and a half, and I must say that the quality of books in those libraries has markedly decreased, with a lot of magazines, hopelessly battered paperbacks and dated technical books popping up all around town.</description>

      <description>**Wednesday July 13: *HEX* Reading**
Dutch author Thomas Olde Heuveltâs horror novel *HEX*Â was a worldwide bestseller before it was even translated into English. Now it should become a bestseller in America, too; itâs got all the elements of a good horror yarn, including a witchâs curse, imperiled teens, a plague of suicides, and the fate of the known universe. *University Book Store, 4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/. Free. All ages.</description>

      <description>Hereâs a poem called âRed Lineage:â
My name is Vulnerable Red.
My mother&#39;s name is Staunch Red.
My father&#39;s name is Red-Eye Red.
I come from a people known for flagrance
&amp; survival.

Remember me.
 Here is another poem called âRed Lineage:â
 âRed Lineageâ is a poem told in variations, and written by many poets. In some of the poems, the motherâs name is Sea Red or Bad to the Bone Red and the fatherâs name is Mountain Red or Murder Red.</description>

      <description>âLife moves fast â books should too,â promises a promotional website for mega-bestselling author James Pattersonâs new line of branded mini-novels. BookShots are Pattersonâs take on the genre novella, a slick package intended to appeal to Twitter-friendly attention spans. BookShots.com promises that each of the thrillers and romances under the BookShot umbrella will be âUnder 150 pages. Under $5. Impossible to put down,â and in case the breathless copy doesnât get the point across, the site features a 30-second ad featuring a Patrick Bateman-looking young man being chased through the streets of a big city as he reads a BookShot:</description>

      <description>On the plane I whisper the travel prayer more softly
I mouth the words but keep the breath carefully
concealed in my throat, worried I donât have a permit
for these verses in international airspace.
The prayer is filled with soft sounds
Ash-ha-du a tender hush, unlike
the sharp hiss of testify. And the mess
of vowels&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;la ilaa ha illaa&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;wants breath
it is difficult to keep this all inside.
It is difficult to pray, and even more</description>

...late last month, Google deleted both Cooperâs blog and his Gmail account without providing any advance notice to him. Visiting the URL now brings up an error page stating that the page has been removed, and that â[t]his address is not available for new blogs.â Cooper is currently updating the situation on his Facebook page, though he does not have very much to report at the moment.</description>

      <description>Sponsor (and previous Seattle resident!) Sonya Chung&amp;rsquo;s second novel, The Loved Ones is accruing a lot of interest before its publication date in October. The Millions put it on their &amp;ldquo;most anticipated list&amp;rdquo;, for example.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got a nice long excerpt from the book on our Sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page for you to read. We hope you&amp;rsquo;ll like the book enough to consider pre-ordering it from your favorite store.
It&amp;rsquo;s thanks to sponsors like Sonya Chung, and readers like you, that we&amp;rsquo;re able to keep the pixels lit up here at the Seattle Review of Books.</description>

      <description>In the play Le Demi-Monde by Alexandre Dumas (the younger), he describes a parallel universe in 19th century France where older, married women spend their time in a swirl of seduction, dazzling parties, and opportunism. It was an ode to that epitome of Epicureanism, where a lux libertine lifestyle was the new moral standard and swashbuckling Lotharios oozed charm, no matter their age. But Dumas would not have known that the title of his play would come to characterize an entire lifestyle for the next few decades.</description>

      <description>Every Monday remaining in the month of July, weâll talking to Seattle-area booksellers about the books theyâre most excited to read this summer. Events coordinator Nicole Lamb has worked at Wallingfordâs Comics Dungeon for nearly five years. Sheâs especially interested in all-ages comics and comics with an LGBT angle, so when sheâs asked about her favorite new summer comics, she canât choose between her two passions.

First, Lamb says sheâs excited that Boom Studios has finally released an all-ages comic called *Power Up* in a trade paperback format.</description>

      <description>Mother, Writer, Monster, Maid Rufi Thorpeâs article is a jarringly honest reflection on her attempt to reconcile art, motherhood, and marriage. It exemplifies the vulnerability that comes with good writing and reveals a litany of thoughts that open a window into the multifaceted life of an individual woman.
  For me, the conflict between motherhood and my life as a writer is not so much Brooksâ fear that artâs job is to unsettle, while a motherâs job is to make safe.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m already getting excited to introduce David Sedaris when he reads at Benaroya Hall on Wednesday, November 16th. (Here&amp;rsquo;s last year&amp;rsquo;s introduction.) If you&amp;rsquo;re at all interested in attending this reading, you should know that tickets are on sale now, and they usually sell out very early. I attend a lot of readings, and I can tell you that Sedaris is the best reader I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. He also sticks around and signs everyone&amp;rsquo;s books before and after the reading, taking the time to have a personal conversation with everyone in line.</description>

Dear Cienna,
**Some time ago, my local NPR affiliate stopped interviewing authors on a regular basis. They used to do author interviews practically every day, but now theyâll only feature a segment on a book once or twice a week, if Iâm lucky.</description>

A resident of Portland since 1959, Ursula K. Le Guin is an incredibly influential writer, particularly in science fiction and fantasy. She received multiple Hugo and Nebula awards, among many other distinguished honors â despite experiencing numerous rejections at the beginning of her career. Le Guin gained widespread popularity in the 60s and 70s with her short stories and Left Hand of Darkness, a novel pioneering the feminist science fiction genre.</description>

Itâs easy to scoff at authors who complain about their book tours: oh, your publisher pays to fly you around the country to visit bookstores and meet people who are excited to see you? How horrible for you.
But in the new documentary Neil Gaiman: Dream Dangerously, the perils of a signing tour feel very visceral. In the span of three months, Gaiman estimates he has signed an average of three books for 50,000 individuals who have come to his events.</description>

      <description>Sometimes a book will get lost in the depths of a nightstand table for months at a time. That was the case with Leanne Shaptonâs Was She Pretty?, a comic which came out earlier this year and then was promptly lost in the stack of books that rests about six inches away from my sleeping head. In a fit of too-late spring cleaning pique, I finally excavated the book last week and read it in one big thirsty gulp, only to find that it is too good to be lost.</description>

      <description>The Short Run Festival announced their latest special guest: Hatem Imam, a cartoonist and editor who was put on trial in Lebanon for the &amp;ldquo;crime&amp;rdquo; of publishing two supposedly controversial panels in anthology comics. This New Yorker story has more information about the trial. Imam&amp;rsquo;s appearance in Seattle this fall will undoubtedly kick off a citywide conversation about religion, censorship, and satire. Short Run is on November 5th this year.</description>

      <title>Literary Event of the Week: N.K. Jemisin at the Seattle Public Library</title>

      <guid>http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/literary-event-of-the-week-nk-jemisin-at-the-seattle-public-library/</guid>
      <description>N.K. Jemisinâs 2014 short story âWalking Awakeâ begins with a very familiar power dynamic. In the opening lines a âMasterâ appears, âwearing a relatively young body.â The Master appraises some young, strong bodies, which weâre told will then be sent to the âtransfer center.â Itâs pretty clear within a few paragraphs that âWalking Awakeâ is a science-fiction take on the master/slave dynamic. Readers almost immediately get the sense that Masters subsume slave bodies entirely and live inside them, a surprising elaboration on the idea that anyone can âownâ another human beingâs body.</description>

      <description>Here, in two easy steps, is the secret to succeeding in Seattle:
 First, tell everyone you know about what youâre planning to do. Then, actually do it.  Number two is the most crucial part, obviously. Seattleâs writers and artists are drowning in aspiration; everyone has an idea of what theyâd do with unlimited time and resources. Theyâd write a book, theyâd start a citywide conversation about a topic that really matters to them, theyâd build a community around a gallery or store or event.</description>

      <description>The fact that Elie Wiesel passed away on the same weekend that Donald Trump tweeted a barely coded anti-Semitic graphic from a white supremacist group was more than just unfortunate timing: it served as a reminder that we need writers and advocates and witnesses like Wiesel in our public sphere more than ever. He will be missed.

      <description>I have this notion that if you live long enough,
there are three or four great stories that you will have in your life.
A story of a journey or a transformation.
A story of love, which will likely mean the loss of love, a story
of loss. And a story of spiritual illumination,
which, for many, will probably be the moment of death itself,
the story untellable, its beginning and middle</description>

      <description>5 Reasons Why Moby-Dick Just Wonât Die Thankfully, my high school English teacher decided weâd skip the technical chapters on how to behead a whale. But Mark Beauregard explains why Melvilleâs Moby Dick as a whole is still relevant 165 years later.
 To be an American in 2016 is to feel threatened from within and without. We have anxiety about our role in the world and our responsibilities to other Americans, which some people want to solve by electing a monomaniacal Captain Ahab (Trump) to take the helm and some people want to solve by electing a radical populist Ishmael (Sanders).</description>

In his forthcoming book, âThe Voyeurâs Motel,â acclaimed journalist and nonfiction author Gay Talese chronicles the bizarre story of Gerald Foos, who allegedly spied on guests at his Colorado motel from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s.
But Talese overlooked a key fact in his book: Foos sold the motel, located in Aurora, Colo., in 1980 and didnât reacquire it until eight years later, according to local property records.</description>

Octavia Butler would have turned 69 last week. Though she struggled to earn mainstream acceptance of her work early in her career, Butler is now considered one of the most influential and important Science Fiction writers of the late 20th century. She came up through the Clarion Workshop, where there is now a scholarship in her honor to support writers of color.</description>

      <description>This Jonkers infographic, &amp;ldquo;Working Titles of Famous Novels,&amp;rdquo; is an interesting study of what might have been. Would 1984 have been as popular as it has been if it retained its working title of The Last Man in Europe? I kind of doubt it. That said, some of the working titles are better: I&amp;rsquo;ve always preferred Atlas Shrugged&amp;rsquo;s working title because it better reflects Ayn Rand&amp;rsquo;s on-the-nose aesthetics. A quick internet search reveals that people have been wondering after working title what-might-have-beens for years.</description>

...radically different understandings of what love and marriage should be; he grew up in a warm and loving family in Tulsa, Oklahoma, his father an orthodontist, his mother a stay-at-home mom while she grew up as the only child of two famous psychologists who related to her more as an in-house experiment, than a child to love; it extends from their first meeting to more than a decade into their unlikely marriage.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been three months since the first issue of the Ta-Nehisi Coates/Brian Stelfreeze Black Panther was published. You can tell that the series has become a runaway bestseller because it&amp;rsquo;s the first monthly comic that local bookstores like University Book Store and Elliott Bay Book Company are carrying as they&amp;rsquo;re released, rather than waiting for the hardcover graphic novel compilations to be published.
Yesterday, the third issue of Black Panther arrived in stores.</description>

      <description>Samantha Pak at the Seattle Globalist has written a great report on diversity in Seattle&amp;rsquo;s bookstore scene. It&amp;rsquo;s a must-read.
 Seattle cartoonist Seth Goodkind discovered that someone plagiarized his artwork in order to win a contest put on by a music festival. When confronted, the artist apologized, but Goodkind wrote a wonderful letter explaining why plagiarism and contests for &amp;ldquo;exposure&amp;rdquo; harm artists. It&amp;rsquo;s publicly posted on his Facebook wall and it&amp;rsquo;s worth your time to read the whole thing.</description>

      <description>**Wednesday June 29: *Know the Mother* Reading **
Desiree Cooperâs short story collection *Know the Mother* examines motherhood in all its complicated variations â mothers of unborn children, mothers of adults, unhappy mothers. Seattle author Tara Conklinâs novel *The House Girl* is a novel about a runaway slaveâs legacy. These two should deliver a fascinating conversation about race and gender. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.comÂ . Free.</description>

      <title>Literary Event of the Week: How to tell a story using this one weird trick</title>

      <description>**UPDATE**: Due to illness, the event celebrating author Dorthe Nors that was originally scheduled for this week has been canceled.
Headlines used to be an art form. Newspapers once hired people specifically to condense all the drama and nuance and vitality of a news story into five or six words that could grab readers at twenty paces.
Now the headline has become the domain of the social media expert, and their goals are much more modest: to divert you, however momentarily, from your Facebook news feed.</description>

      <description>When we started the Seattle Review of Books we had two options for trying to fund our content: put ugly ads on every page, or try something experimental with a sponsorship program. There were three points that made this an easy choice:
 Ad rates are falling across the internet. Many sites need to place more and more ad slots just to make the same amount of money they used to.</description>

      <description>Hereâs the deal: you are perfectly welcome to tell me that you hate poetry, as long as Iâm allowed to hit you upside the head with a copy of Hannah Faith Notessâs collection The Multitude in response.
Iâm asking permission to assault you with her book because Notessâs work effectively counters every single one of your arguments against poetry. You say you donât like poetry because you think itâs too vague?</description>

âWe fucking won,â Amelia Bonow announced last night on the corner of 10th and Pike. The crowd around her burst into applause and victorious whoops. These dozens of people had gathered to celebrate the Supreme Court decision that struck down onerous abortion clinic restrictions in Texas. The 5-3 decision, which was delivered a little over twelve hours before the street party, was one of the biggest wins for a woman&amp;rsquo;s right to choose since Roe V Wade.</description>

      <description>Bruise: A Study
I. The bruise begs
in purple tones
for you to think
with your tongue,
for you to listen
with your hands
to the tremulous
voice of my skin.
II. I:
pressed it into my skin, ran into the corner of the counter on my way to make dinner, opened a door in to my shin, let you too close, slammed my finger in the car door, dropped a book on my toe, pushed the baby on the swing and didnât watch her swing back, had surgery, pinched myself over and over like a pulse, slammed my head against a wall, ignored the warning signs, fell down stairs, fell into you, fell away from you when you pushed, found myself under something heavy.</description>

      <description>Sponsor SJ Watson is coming to Seattle! You probably know him from his thriller Before I Go to Sleep, which was made into a major motion picture by Rowan Joffee, starrting Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth. His latest book Second Life is out in paperback.
He&amp;rsquo;s going to be at University Book Store in conversation with local writer Sonya Lea. If for some reason, you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with his work, a good place to start is our sponsors page, which has the entire first chapter from Second Life.</description>

Vanessa will be checking in with us twice a year or so, and reporting back on what we&#39;ve done well, and where we can improve, in terms of diversity. If her name sounds familiar to you, perhaps it&#39;s because you&#39;ve read her work at _The Toast_, _Bitch Media_, _Vice_, or _The Establishment_ (just to name a few).</description>

      <description>You can have the best-stocked bookstore in the world, but without booksellers it would be nearly useless. In fact, a bookstore exists in that space where the booksellers and literature intersect. We need them to direct us to books â classics, rarities, backlist, brand-new bestsellers â and explain why we should be interested in them.
The new team of booksellers at Seward Parkâs Third Place Books bring decades of bookselling experience to the neighborhood, along with a few new booksellers.</description>

      <description>Road Tripping While Female Road trips have been a fascination for decades. They are trips with endless possibilities, a chance to venture into the unfamiliar to find yourself. But as Bernadette Murphy points out, the presence of female road-trippers in literature is severely lacking. Jack Kerouacs fill the niche of road narratives, and always with exciting adventures. With women, however, the narratives focus more on the dangers of the road.</description>

My bad memories arenât of working at bookstores, mind you. Theyâre of people like Wendy Werris.</description>

      <description>Well, er, good morning. Seattle writers are responding to the news that the world&amp;rsquo;s gone all Trumpy. You should read Nicola Griffith on Brexit:
This vote broke the UK; it might break the EU. There will be a recession, a bad one. The xenophobes have been unleashed. This result has invited the whirlwind. We&amp;rsquo;re starting to see posts about what Brexit means for the publishing industry, but the truth is that nobody knows what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen âÂ not really.</description>

      <description>Itâs probably just a coincidence that the eighth issue of Kelly Sue DeConnick and Valentine De Landroâs sci-fi women-in-space-prison comic Bitch Planet was published less than a week after the fourth season of Orange Is the New Black arrived on Netflix. But, for the sake of people who write weekly columns about comic books, itâs a happy coincidence. From the very beginning, Bitch Planet has been compared with Orange, and itâs easy to see why: theyâre both about womensâ prisons, they both feature diverse casts, and theyâre both feminist-minded sociological studies of modern incarceration culture.</description>

      <description>You are hopefully already watching #NoBillNoBreak, the Democratic Congressional sit-in to demand a vote on gun responsibility laws. It&amp;rsquo;s a striking bit of political drama, and a battle over one of the most important issues of our time.
I just wanted to remind you that Georgia Congressman John Lewis, the originator of this sit-in, has been at this kind of thing for a very long time, and he is the author of an amazing autobiographical comics series called The March about the fight for civil rights.</description>

      <description>Last month, Elissa Washuta become one of the most-envied writers in the Seattle area when she became the Fremont Bridge&amp;rsquo;s very first writer-in-residence. UW Today interviewed Washuta about how that&amp;rsquo;s going:   Iâll be spending many summer afternoons in a small, beautiful office in the northwest tower of the Fremont Bridge. The office is mine alone this summer, and it looks out over the Lake Washington Ship Canal. I watch the bridge open and close while I write.</description>

      <description>**Wednesday June 22: *Grace* Reading**
If youâre going to attend one reading by a debut novelist this year, skip the horse-chokingly thick tour-de-force by the white-boy wunderkind from Brooklyn and attend this one instead. Narrated by a ghostââI am deadâ is the first lineâNatashia DeÃ³nâs riveting *Grace* tells the story of black women in Americaâs slave trade. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.comÂ .

      <description>Sometimes all the good things happen in a single night. These are the nights where you want to throw yourself into a large sterile glass tube, flip a mad-scientist switch, and then send a clone or two staggering off into the night, just so youâre sure you donât miss a thing. Thursday, June 23rd is one of those nights.
The poetry collective Margin Shift has for years been presenting some of the liveliest, most diverse readings in town.</description>

      <description>After [looking into why poems go viral](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/06/21/a-poet-explores-when-poems-go-viral/), Kelli Russell Agodon was not done. She wanted to talk to the people involved, too. Here&#39;s her interview with poet [Maggie Smith](https://twitter.com/maggiesmithpoet), and _Waxwing Magazine_ editors [Justin Bigos](https://twitter.com/JustinBigos), Erin Stalcup, and [W. Todd Kaneko](https://twitter.com/ToddKaneko).
The Poet of âGood Bones,â Maggie Smith **Kelli Russell Agodon: Can you trace back to the first person(s) who shared it or when it took off for you? Can you figure out (besides Waxwing) where/how it began to spread?</description>

      <description>When was the last time you remember a poem going viral? This week, despite ongoing reports of âpoetry being deadâ for the last fifteen years, Maggie Smithâs poem âGood Bonesâ has been shared generously and thousands of times over on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Tumblr, as well as the story being picked up in the Guardian, Slate, The Daily Dot, and The Oregonian.
I decided to follow path backwards to figure out how this poem ended up being passed on throughout the world.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time a man took me to dinner, asked
if Iâd been abused as a child, like that would explain it.
Sure. I keep a cabinet of curiosities &amp;mdash;
but that was never one of them. See the dust?
Things weâre too old for slip off shelves,
line up to watch. In direct sunlight theyâre small,
made of ash, disintegrating like abrupt love.
To recall a memory weakens it,</description>

      <title>Why doesn&#39;t Amazon &#34;add support for DRM-free ePub ebooks?&#34;</title>

      <description>The eBook Reader blog wonders:
Kindle ereaders are one of the few reading devices on the planet that donât support ePub format.
Kindles are the most popular dedicated readers and ePub is the most common ebook format, so what gives?
Why doesnât Amazon add support for ePub ebooks to Kindles?
 I guess this could be a rhetorical question, but the answer is ridiculously obvious: because Amazon doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to open its system up or allow people to read e-books that they&amp;rsquo;ve bought in other places.</description>

      <description>Sponsor Entre Rios books is back. Did you know it&amp;rsquo;s been two hundred years, this week, since Mary Shelley, Lord Byron, Claire Clairmont, and Percy Bysshe Shelley met at Lake Geneva, and spun the stories that would turn into Dracula and Frankenstein?
But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t only horror and science fiction that came that fateful time together. Byron inspired Shelley, and pushed him to reach greater heights with his poetry. One avenue, unknown for many years, was Shelley&amp;rsquo;s political work, which Entre Rios has collected (in Shelley&amp;rsquo;s preferred order) in a small handsome volume.</description>

      <description>âBy autobiography, we meant daydreams, nightdreams, the act of writing, the relationship to the reader, the meeting of flesh and culture; the self as collaboration, the self as disintegration, the gaps, inconsistencies, and distortions of the self; the enjambments of power, family, history, and language.â 
![](/webhook-uploads/1466392624231/communalnude.jpg)
In *Communal Nude: Collected Essays*, this is one of the ways Robert GlÃ¼ck introduces New Narrative, a term he coined with Bruce Boone and Steve Abbott in the late 1970s to describe a form of prose writing emerging in the San Francisco Bay Area as a response to Language poetry and its formalist obsession with breaking apart (and breaking down) voice and context to interrogate the ways that words generate meaning.</description>

At least one of those new booksellers, though, isnât new to the world of books: though Seward Park is the only bookstore where sheâs worked, Naomi possesses an impressive resume including stints as a manager of the circulation desk at Yale libraries, and as a humanities professor.</description>

      <description>What Would Happen If We Just Gave People Money? A minimum guaranteed income is a hot topic right now, in advance of technological changes, like self-driving trucks, that are likely to put huge amounts of people out of work in very short order. That will be a huge hit on an already stretched-thin safety net. What if, instead, we just gave people money? That way, they can survive, they can get by, they can live a decent life, and have the resources to be trained in other work they will find more fulfilling.</description>

      <description>Happy Bloomsday!
 The Private Eye Writers of America have announced the nominees for their annual awards, the Shamuses. Local nominees include J.A. Jance and Ingrid Thoft, who were both nominated in the &amp;ldquo;Best Private Eye Novel&amp;rdquo; category.
 Have you read the Neu Jorker, the spot-on New Yorker parody produced by comedy writers from The Onion, the Late Show with David Letterman, and more? It&amp;rsquo;s eerie how good this magazine is, right down to the phony ads.</description>

      <description>In 2010 and early 2011, writer Brian Michael Bendis and his frequent collaborator, artist Alex Maleev, published the first five issues of a comic titled Scarlet. Bendis and Maleev have always been ideal collaborators: something about Bendisâs propensity for including too much Mamet-style dialogue on every page works well with Maleevâs photorealism, which often fails to convey action in any convincing way. Their comics â particularly their long run on Daredevil âÂ tend to be wordy dramas that feel more like plays than the usual action movies youâll find in superhero comics.</description>

      <description>Every Mary Roach book is crammed full of fascinating characters. In the course of her pop science investigations (Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers; Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife; Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex; Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void; and Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal) Roach often interviews the kind of obsessive minds who used to be referred to as âeccentrics.</description>

Wednesday June 15: Grunt Reading
Perhaps youâve read one or two of Mary Roachâs very funny investigations of weird everyday science (Stiff, about death and dying, was her debut; Bonk, about sex, was another high point). Her latest, Grunt, is about the science of war, and it promises more shocking, ridiculous, and downright disgusting revelations. I&amp;rsquo;ll be joining Roach onstage for a Q&amp;amp;A. Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.</description>

âThe pregnant girl enters the Trenton Family Clinic,â begins Tracy Baroneâs debut novel Happy Family, âlooking like she parted the Red Sea to get there. The lower half of her dress is wet with amniotic fluid, and the upper half is streaked with sweat.â This is a grand opening line for a novel, dense with imagery, evocative of the Bible, and thick with bodily fluids. It promises both legend and messy corporeality.</description>

      <description>We have an Instagram account! Let me utilize it here to extend some thanks.
Last Friday, Push/Pull Gallery and the Seattle Review of Books teamed up to host Christine Marie Larsen&amp;rsquo;s opening at the Essential Natural Mattress store, in Belltown. Hanging on the wall, all around us, were the originals of the portraits she paints for us each week.
Also in attendence, were three readers who did us the honor of showing up, presenting some work, and then, posing with their portraits.</description>

      <description>As highly socialized apes, we are fascinated by human interactions. Weâre attuned to conflicts, and conflict resolution, and bargaining, and all manner of seduction. And we love to read about all those things in our fiction. Why, then, arenât there more books about union organizers? People who organize labor see the gamut of human emotion: greed, hope, disappointment, rage. Their job is to get a large number of people to do something.</description>

      <description>Charlotte Runcie at The Telegraph does some literary sleuthing to contextualize the literary tradition that inspired the sonnet that Lin-Manuel Miranda read at the Tony Awards on Sunday.
...Mirandaâs sonnet is 16 lines long, and has some moments of unconventional rhythm. What does that tell us? The best-known writer of the 16-line sonnet is probably the Victorian writer George Meredith, who wrote a sequence of them titled âModern Loveâ, exploring his own disastrous marriage and expressing a sentiment that love in his time had become corrupted and corrosive.</description>

      <description>What I brew in me
your tongue no longer tastes.
Do you believe passion
or security
ruins the palette?
We once boiled red
like the most glorious
emergency
and at the worst times.
Sip me
before Iâm lukewarm,
before the whistle of regret
keeps us awake.
Dear love, last night
I walked in the rain
dressed only in a bathrobe. I bought
a little kettle on sale
and am convinced our lives</description>

      <description>One of the most famous translators in the world has died, ABC News reports:
Rabassa was an essential gateway to the 1960s Latin American &#34;boom,&#34; when such authors as Garcia Marquez, Cortazar and Mario Vargas Llosa became widely known internationally. He worked on the novel that helped start the boom, Cortazar&#39;s *Hopscotch*, for which Rabassa won a National Book Award for translation. He also worked on the novel which defined the boom, Garcia Marquez&#39;s *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, a monument of 20th century literature.</description>

      <description>Sponsor Paul Vidich&amp;rsquo;s An Honorable Man has been getting a great reception. It&amp;rsquo;s Washington D.C., 1953, and any fan of spy novels knows that this time is pivotal in the espionage game. Russia in chaos after Stalin died, McCarthyism taking root at home, the Cold War starting its long tense march.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got a full chapter on our sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page for you to read and see what you think. An Honorable Man is the perfect Father&amp;rsquo;s Day book, a taut thriller set in an important American past.</description>

      <title>Seattle Public Library visits down</title>

      <description>Gene Balk, the Seattle Times&amp;rsquo;s excellent &amp;ldquo;FYI Guy,&amp;rdquo; reported over the weekend that &amp;ldquo;Between 2011 and 2014, branch visits to Seattle Public Library declined by about 150,000 â even as branch hours were added.&amp;rdquo; Visits are especially down in the city&amp;rsquo;s lowest-income neighborhoods, for unclear reasons. Circulation of digital materials, however, is way up.
Could the lack of visits have to do with SPL leadership&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;anti-book&amp;rdquo; agenda? Considering that many of Seattle&amp;rsquo;s independent booksellers saw record sales during the same years that SPL&amp;rsquo;s visits declined, an anti-book agenda probably isn&amp;rsquo;t helping matters.</description>

Before he took the lead position at the new Third Place Books Seward Park, he worked as one of a handful of managers at Third Placeâs Lake Forest Park store, and he spent two years at Half Price Books on Capitol Hill. All told, heâs worked in bookstores for a dozen years.
And heâs been involved with Seward Park since the very beginning.</description>

      <description>Cities Like Seattle Are Recklessly Unprepared For Self-Driving Cars New Seattle-based publidation Scout takes on the infrastructure of self-driving cars. It asks a vital question: in the modern days of rapid technological change, how can the traditionally slow process of civic change catch up to technology and ideas that will benefit the city?
 Timelines for the arrival of consumer-ready self driving cars range from two to 20 years. Even if 20 years go by before Americans trade in their driverâs licenses, the fact that only one out of every 17 cities is even thinking about self-driving cars is shocking.</description>

      <description>Whenever I read a glowing blurb on a book these days, I wonder to myself, &amp;ldquo;what is this person&amp;rsquo;s relationship to the author?&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that authors write blurbs for friends, or former students, or authors who have previously blurbed them. Every blurb comes with a price âÂ a favor owed, a favor repaid. A bookseller once told me that the only blurber they trusted was Thomas Pynchon, because Pynchon was a recluse and therefore he only blurbed books that he honestly liked because he didn&amp;rsquo;t carry the personal baggage that every other author did when it comes to blurbs.</description>

      <description>Seattle author Neal Stephenson&amp;rsquo;s Seveneves will be adapted into a film by writer Bill Broyles, director Ron Howard and producer Brian Grazer â the same team that made Apollo 13, Deadline reports. Based on Martin McClellan&amp;rsquo;s review of Seveneves, they have a lot of good stuff to work with.
 Author Kate Messner wrote a kid&amp;rsquo;s book about addiction. Apparently, this is a controversial-enough topic that a school cancelled Messner&amp;rsquo;s planned visit:</description>

Writer Tom Kingâs The Vision series from Marvel Comics is such a weird, wonderful thing. Itâs a superhero comic that features virtually no superheroics, a domestic drama about superheroes thatâs more interested in the psychology of its main characters than their powers. Itâs a Cheeveresque suburban drama where the secrets that the main characters keep from each other manifest in the form of murder and the deeper issues of faith and existential angst materialize in the form of the convoluted Gordian knot of comics history.</description>

  Mitchell Duneierâs Ghetto: The Invention of a Place, the History of an Idea uses the stories of prominent sociologists to trace the etymology and usage of a single word: âghetto.â
If you donât understand the ghetto, Duneierâs book might not be your best starting point.</description>

      <description>**Wednesday June 8: *Homegoing* Reading **
Itâs hard to turn anyoneâs head with a dust jacket blurb these days, but the rare appearance of a Ta-Nehisi Coates blurb on Yaa Gyasiâs debut novel *Homegoing* â calling the book an âinspirationâ and citing its âso fully realized, so elegantly carvedâ characters â is a rare meaningful instance. It announces this book as something worth your time. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.</description>

Walk down First Avenue and youâll be sure to see them: two giant posters reproducing artwork from Goya and Picasso, right next to a giant poster featuring Robert Crumb.</description>

      <description>M. Thomas Gammarinoâs *King of the Worlds* is an excellent sci-fi novel that combines the interiority of literary fiction from the 50s, 60s and 70s with the all-out weirdness of the golden age of science fiction. (You can [read my review here](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-final-frontier/).) Itâs set in an alternate universe in which a child actor named Dylan Greenyears stars in a wildly popular Terry Gilliam-directed sequel to *ET: The Extraterrestrial.* Greenyears becomes a huge celebrity, but then heâs publicly humiliated when James Cameron fires him from *Titanic*.</description>

**Pine Hills just went back to the Dewey Decimal System; how do you feel about it?**
Iâm not sure who was happierâthe staff or the patrons! The branches had been using a âbookstore modelâ for a few years, where books are more loosely arranged by topic, not by the official Dewey numbers and categories.</description>

      <description>For many years, I had an agreement with Jhumpa Lahiri. Well, it wasnât so much an agreement because she never agreed to it. In any case, it went like this: for as long as Lahiri would write fiction and novels, I would read them. In my mind, Lahiri was embarking down the road to a long and fulfilling career, like a Philip Roth or a John Updike, and I was prepared to read all her new books as they came out, to expand my understanding of her writing one book at a time.</description>

Every time Iâve visited in the three weeks that theyâve been open, the Seward Park branch of Third Place Books has been busy. The Raconteur cafÃ© and restaurant in the front of the store is always slammed âÂ it had to close for lack of food on opening day, which is a high-quality problem. And sometimes itâs hard to browse the books you want because someone else is already standing right where you want to be.</description>

We spend the rest of the film with Maleev-Babel as he he travels the world trying to discover the truth about his grandfatherâs past.
As Maleev-Babel follows his grandfatherâs footsteps, Finding Babel unspools in a chorus of voices.</description>

      <description>Itâs perhaps a gross generalization to say that most novelists donât understand quantum physics, but it is a generalization that I feel confident standing behind. Youâll see certain well-worn scientific oversimplifications dragged out again and again in fiction: the idea of light being both particle and wave, depending on how you observe it; the fact that gravity is dependent on mass; and the idea that there are countless parallel universes out there, a multiverse where every world you can imagine is true.</description>

Last week, Marvel Comics published the first issue of a comic book titled Captain America: Steve Rogers by writer Nick Spencer and artist Jesus Saiz. At the end of the comic âÂ uh, spoilers, I guess â the superhero Captain America is revealed to have always been a double-agent of Hydra, a super-villain analog to the Nazis. (You can read an explainer here.) People on the internet wrote a lot of posts and tweets and Facebook updates expressing their dismay about the reveal.</description>

      <description>BuzzFeed writer Arianna Rebolini writes in a Craigslist lost and found ad that she lost a white Mead 5-Star composition notebook while visiting Seattle:
Hi! I was in your beautiful city the weekend of May 20 and seem to have misplaced an incredibly important notebook in that time. Have you seen it? It&#39;s a 5-star Mead composition notebook with a white plastic-y cover with folder inlay. On the inside you will see an index and then headings like &#34;</description>

      <description>Well, this is huge.
Now after 13 years of remarkable rewards, a ton of laughs, hard work, good cheer, and so many remarkable children and families in my life, Iâm ready to start new projects, write new stories, and make time for yet more fearless adventures.
The timing is right. We have weathered some big changes in the organization and will be returning to our remodeled post-gas-explosion site in a few weeks.</description>

      <description>This, which we found on poet Kelli Russell Agodon&amp;rsquo;s Twitter feed, is a terrific idea: poet.tips recommends poets to you, in the by-now-ubiquitous internet recommendation format of &amp;ldquo;If you like X, then you&amp;rsquo;ll like Y.&amp;rdquo; The engine stretches from classics&amp;hellip;
 Edna St. Vincent Millay T.S. Eliot Denise Levertov  &amp;hellip;to contemporary greats&amp;hellip;
 Patricia Lockwood Dorothea Lasky Alice Notley Eileen Myles  &amp;hellip;to local favorites:
 Kelli Russell Agodon Sherman Alexie Karen Finneyfrock Maged Zaher  Recommendation engines are not the be-all end-all of discovery, of course, but they can send you on some interesting tangents.</description>

      <description>I was a kindergartener in 1958 when the in loco parentis doctrine, which granted teachers the same rights as parents to punish children in their care, was still common practice. It allowed my mean-eyed teacher with the heavily penciled eyebrows and too-black hair to take it upon herself to line up every child in the classroom and inspect our underwear. Someone had pooped their pants and the hapless offender would not, could not, face the humiliation of such a public admission &amp;mdash; at least not voluntarily.</description>

      <description>There used to be two LGBT-themed bookstores on Capitol Hill alone. Now there are none. Lots of people would say that this is a sign of progress â after all, though we may not have a Beyond the Closet or a Bailey/Coy on Capitol Hill anymore, pretty much every bookstore in town now has a huge section devoted to LGBT issues. Virtually every bookstore I can think of has at least one LGBT employee, and some have many more than one.</description>

      <description>Science fiction has always inspired real-world technological advances. The very first employees of NASA were inspired by the rocket-ship and ray-gun festooned pulp sci-fi of the 1930s and 1940s. Most of the greatest innovators of the last 30 years have found their inspiration in sci-fi novels. Steve Jobs, creepily, recommended 1984 to new hires at Apple. Elon Musk is very public about his love of Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and Douglas Adams.</description>

      <description>In 2013, I won *The Stranger*âs Genius Award in literature, which came as a wondrous gift that linked me to the place I lived and wrote in for fourteen years (by then.) Part of the responsibility of winning a Genius Award is to vote in future Genius competitions. This yearâs nominees include local poetry publisher Wave Books. I want to explain why I will probably not vote for them.
It all started few years ago.</description>

      <description>for missing First Nations women
This is a canvas of blood &amp;mdash;
A hazy procession of the baited.
The earth is asleep.
The sky is awake.
And the wind leaves behind the awful heaviness of bodies.
Hoofbeats sprout curses &amp;mdash; crisp, greaseless.
The song across rooftops is a wild conflation of grisly wrongs.
Iâll tell you a lie that you can believe, like a noose of braided black hair:
Life made me meager with the dementia of police reports.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Memorial Day, which means summer is due to arrive here in Seattle sometime in the next two to ten weeks. This is the time of year when you see a lot of sites promote their summer reading lists. We&amp;rsquo;ve never been especially into lists here at the Seattle Review of Books, but if you dig them, that&amp;rsquo;s great. We&amp;rsquo;re happy you&amp;rsquo;ll soon have a lot of lists to choose from.</description>

I hope you&#39;ll come to [SIFF&#39;s Shoreline outpost](http://www.siff.net/shoreline-community-college) tomorrow at 3 pm to watch a secreening of *Author: The JT LeRoy Story*. I&#39;ll be interviewing director Jeff Feuerzeig after the film. [The Vulture&#39;s Bilge Ebiri](http://www.vulture.com/2016/01/sundance-review-author-the-jt-leroy-story.html) reviewed the movie when it debuted at Sundance, calling it...
...a maze of identity: A girl who dreams of herself as a boy who dreams of himself as a girl, played by a girl pretending to be a boy, all overseen by the girl herself, playing another, different girl.</description>

      <description>Title Fight Tony Tulathimutte in the Paris Review on who gets to name a novel.
 The history of writers fighting for their book titles is extensive and bloody; so powerful is the publisherâs veto that not even Toni Morrison, fresh off her Nobel win, got to keep her preferred title for _Paradise_, which was _War_. (For her most recent book, _God Help the Child_, she favored _The Wrath of Children_.</description>

      <description>On Thursday, June 2nd, Seattle City of Literature, with support from Seattleâs Office of Civil Rights, will present the first of three free workshops on racial equity in the literary arts. This is important stuff; youâd be hard-pressed to find anyone who argues that literature is anywhere near parity in its representation. In fact, we saw some high-profile incidents last year â the Seattle literature anthology, the ridiculous white dude who pretended to be a different race and then pretended it was a political statement â that reminded us of exactly how far we have to go.</description>

      <description>Each week, [Christine Marie Larsen](http://christinelarsen.com) creates a portrait of a new author for us. Have any favorites youâd love to see immortalized? [Let us know](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about)
![](/webhook-uploads/1464237146590/SRoB_30_LIndyWest.jpg)
For my thirtieth portrait for Portrait Gallery, I picked Seattle&amp;rsquo;s own Lindy West. She has been everywhere lately: we reviewed her book, and Paul did this amazing interview with her. She was at Town Hall last night, but if you missed it, you can still catch her tonight at Third Place Books in Lake Forest Park before she&amp;rsquo;s off to events around the country and in the UK.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;This is the weirdest thing that ever happened to me,&amp;rdquo; Lindy West said from the stage at Town Hall last night after being welcomed by a beyond sold-out roomÂ â 1200 people â with thunderous applause. West began by talking a little about the writing of her memoir, Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman. &amp;ldquo;A book, FYI, is eighty thousand words,&amp;rdquo; she told the room. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of words.&amp;rdquo; And it took months to write, many of which she spent &amp;ldquo;in a bat-haunted cabin in Maine.</description>

When we launched the Seattle Review of Books, we knew our sponsorship model was risky. It required training our readers that advertising doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be horrible, despite pretty much everything else you find on the internet.</description>

      <description>A month ago, I referred to the first issue of Heartthrob as âa very promising ghost story/heist comic.â At the time I was giving it a cursory mention as one of a fleet of new heist-themed comics. Now that the second issue of Heartthrob is out in comic shops, I can tell you that it doesnât deserve to be shoved off into laundry list of trends. This is already shaping up to be a terrific comic book.</description>

      <description>Last year, the Seattle Public Library and Seattle Arts and Lectures teamed up to promote a popular Summer Book Bingo program. It was such a success âÂ my social media was at times overwhelmed with #BookBingoNW hashtagsÂ â that they&amp;rsquo;re doing it again. This year&amp;rsquo;s PDF bingo card includes categories like &amp;ldquo;Local author,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;#WeNeedDiverseBooks,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Recommended by a librarian.&amp;rdquo; If you black out the whole card, you&amp;rsquo;ll be entered to win a library of books from Seattle Arts and Lectures along with tickets to the 2016-2017 season.</description>

      <description>Right now, the internet is exploding with spoilers from Marvel and DC Comics. Which is weird. People seem to be getting genuinely upset over some of these plot twists, and they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to understand that this kind of media feeding frenzy has been going on since at least the late 90s, when Superman died for the first time. Look, it&amp;rsquo;s great to see people get excited about comics â I write a column about comics every week â but we don&amp;rsquo;t need to harangue creators or write very long thinkpieces in response to what is obviously a plot twist in an ongoing story.</description>

      <description>**Wednesday May 25: *Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman Reading* **
See the Event of the Week column. *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m.Â * **Thursday May 26: *White Sands* Reading **
Geoff Dyer writes nimbly about difficult concepts that are exceptionally difficult for most writers to explain; he once wrote a book about not writing a book about D.H. Lawrence. *White Sands* is about travel, and the idea of travel, and living in the world; I canât explain it, but I know Dyer can.</description>

Tonight, Lindy West reads from her memoir Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman at Town Hall Seattle, and itâs kind of a triumphant homecoming after the first leg of what looks to be a long book tour: sheâs debuted the book in Chicago and in Brooklyn but she hasnât yet read to a hometown crowd.
When she sat down with me for an interview, I asked Lindy something Iâve been meaning to ask for a very long time: there was a point when she and i worked together at The Stranger when she was becoming a nationally famous feminist cultural critic.</description>

      <description>I sent an email to Eric Reynolds, the associate publisher at Seattle&amp;rsquo;s Fantagraphics Books, to ask about how his company dealt with the so-called &amp;ldquo;Netflix of Comics,&amp;rdquo; Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Comixology Unlimited program. Did they alert their creators about the program before it was announced? Do those creators have the right to withdraw from the Unlimited program if they&amp;rsquo;re unhappy with it? Here is Reynolds&amp;rsquo; response in full:
I did not consult with individual creators, but as with all of our digital sales relationships (subscription or otherwise), I&#39;ve made a point to enter into non-exclusive and non-binding contracts that allow us to remove any titles at a moment&#39;s notice from any platform, in the event that we as a company or an individual author decides they want no part of it (thus far, it&#39;s never happened).</description>

This morning, when the Amazon-owned digital comics retailer Comixology announced their new Unlimited plan, the comics and tech media were rapturous. &amp;ldquo;Say what you will about their effect on the print industry, digital comics have made buying [independent comics] easier,&amp;rdquo; Birth.Movies.Death&amp;rsquo;s Siddhant Adlakha wrote, &amp;ldquo;especially outside North America. Whatâs more, itâs about to get a whole lot easier with this $5.99 a month subscription service, which includes, of course, a 30-day trial.</description>

Rufi Thorpe gained accolades for her first book _[The Girls From Corona Del Mar](http://www.rufithorpe.com/#!cdm/c46c)_, which was long listed for both the 2014 International Dylan Thomas Prize, and the 2014 Flaherty-Dunnan First Novel Prize. Her latest book, _[Dear Fang, With Love](http://www.rufithorpe.com/#!blank/tf1kz)_, is being released today (we ran [our review yesterday](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/five-reviews-in-different-styles-of-rufi-thorpes-brilliant-new-novel/)). I talked to Thorpe over Skype from her home in California. (_Author photo by Nina Subin_)  You start the book with that great poem from Czes&amp;lstrok;aw Mi&amp;lstrok;osz.</description>

smoothing the brown contours that flutter away

cathedrals of solar dust sealed into letters
that contain all of our questions: why are we here?
where do we go when we die? are we really so alone?

      <description>Last Friday night, at the Hugo House&amp;rsquo;s very last reading in its old site, House Executive Director Tree Swenson pulled off a first in the history of readings: her introduction was perhaps more interesting than the headlining authors. Swenson told the audience about the House&amp;rsquo;s penultimate reading, an event called &amp;ldquo;Where the House Was,&amp;rdquo; hosted by Frances McCue. It seems that in the middle of the reading, the event was interrupted by the sound of running water coming from somewhere inside the house.</description>

      <title>Five reviews in different styles of Rufi Thorpe&#39;s brilliant new novel</title>

      <description>THE NEWSPAPER STYLE REVIEW Rufi Thorpe&amp;rsquo;s startling sophomore release, Dear Fang, With Love, which is being released tomorrow, May 24th, brings to mind Roger Ebert&amp;rsquo;s edict about films: they aren&amp;rsquo;t what they&amp;rsquo;re about, but how they&amp;rsquo;re about them.
Not that the what here isn&amp;rsquo;t compelling: a teenage girl, Vera, and her father, Lucas, and a trip they take to Vilnius in Lithuania to trace his familial history, and to get away, in some sense, from dealing with a recent diagnosis of Vera&amp;rsquo;s bi-polar disorder.</description>

      <description>A few Seattle-area booksellers have achieved celebrity status. Theyâre the names that PR people from New York publishers casually drop when they discuss the Seattle market, the booksellers that other booksellers look to for recommendations, the superstars who represent regional booksellers on panels and in organizations. Queen Anne Book Company bookseller Tegan Tigani is absolutely one of those celebrity booksellers. (If you need any more proof of her celebrity status, consider that Montana author Shann Ray recently waxed rhapsodic on the cadence of her name in the middle of an onstage interview.</description>

      <description>How Technology Hijacks Peopleâs Mindsâââfrom a Magician and Googleâs Design Ethicist A peek inside the designer&amp;rsquo;s mind, and how navigation and other tricks by designers and companies trick you into feeling like you have choice, when in fact you&amp;rsquo;re being guided through a very specific experience. The author, Tristan Harris, was Google&amp;rsquo;s design ethicist, so is deeply familiar with all the techniques.
By shaping the menus we pick from, technology hijacks the way we perceive our choices and replaces them new ones.</description>

      <description>Going into this book, I was feeling extremely prejudiced against standard-issue American singer-songwriter guitar music. Especially traditional stuff. Weâre inundated in Seattle. And Woody Guthrie: I get it. He was a socialist protest singer. He was down with the Popular Front in the 1940s. He called his guitar a machine. He meant for it to kill fascists. We would vote Woody Guthrie onto our city council if we could. The songs he wrote still currently catch hella burn at coffeeshops citywide, and on KEXP heâs always there, thanks to the Wilco/Billy Bragg âMermaid Avenueâ record from 18 years ago.</description>

      <description>All the cool literary people are writing comics now. Ta-Nehisi Coates is doing an excellent job with Black Panther, Margaret Atwoodâs comic Angel Catbird is coming out sometime this year, and yesterday the very first issue of sci-fi legend William Gibsonâs very first comic, Archangel, hit the stands. Co-created with screenwriter Michael St. John Smith and illustrated by comics veteran Butch Guice, Archangel is closer to Gibson&amp;rsquo;s previously published work than, say, Black Panther is to Between the World and Me, but Gibson is definitely marking new territory here; this is not a lazy cash-grab Neuromancer sequel in comic form or anything so crass.</description>

Lindy Westâs debut memoir, *Shrill* was published yesterday to great acclaim. I had to recuse myself from reviewing it for the *Seattle Review of Books* due to personal circumstances; I was Lindyâs coworker at *The Stranger* for three years, and she asked me to read *Shrill* before its publication. And so I know Iâm biased, but I do love this book: I think *Shrill* is funny and honest and heartbreaking and empowering and meaningful.</description>

      <description>Our friends at Seattlish just broke the story of a class-action lawsuit filed against the owners of Emerald City Comicon for not paying their volunteers. (ECCC officially calls its volunteers &amp;ldquo;minions,&amp;rdquo; which is not a very good look; ECCC vendors and talent have complained to us about how &amp;ldquo;demeaning&amp;rdquo; that title is on multiple occasions.) Seattlish explains:
According to the suit, the volunteers are expected to work essentially as paid workers would â performing functions necessary to the operation of the convention â but arenât required to be paid for their labor or their overtime due to their volunteer status.</description>

Third Place Books managing partner Robert Sindelar possesses what might be the rarest talent in the United States today: Heâs getting really good at opening new bookstores. Sindelar oversaw the creation and refinement of the gorgeous Ravenna branch of Third Place Books, which is an ideal neighborhood bookstore: not too big, not too small, and thriving at every hour of the day.
Sindelarâs at it again, this time in south Seattle: this Saturday, Third Place Books Seward Park is opening and, with its vaulted ceiling, copious natural light, and burnished-wood glow itâs a serious contender for the title of Seattleâs Most Beautiful Bookstore.</description>

      <description>One of the pleasures of a short story collection is finding the threads that connect the stories. Even if they donât share characters, or a common continuity, the stories all spring from the same churning subconscious, and so they always carry some DNA-deep similarities. On the surface, the stories in Spokane author Sam Ligonâs Wonderland donât have much in common: one or two are steeped in realism, another is a retelling of a nursery rhyme, a couple read like longish dirty jokes.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Imagine a Segway that could kill you and set your house on fire. Thatâs what a jetpack is.&amp;rdquo; Madeline Ashby&amp;rsquo;s blog post from May of last year &amp;ldquo;No one cares about your jetpack: on optimism in futurism&amp;rdquo; was my introduction to her writing. It&amp;rsquo;s a stellar way to meet someone. Ashby is a science fiction writer, and a card-carrying (whereby card I mean Master&amp;rsquo;s diploma) futurist. She works as someone who thinks about the future.</description>

      <description>It wasnât that she wanted to be pretty.
She wanted the world to see her
as she saw herself.
She wanted to see herself.
Thatâs what my daughter tells me.
I watch her, high up on these rocks,
her arm extended in a welcoming gesture &amp;mdash;
she invites the world in.
I hold my phone arm up
an echo of her greeting
and am horrified to see my face &amp;mdash;</description>

      <description>From the AP:
South Korean author Han Kang has won the Man Booker International Prize for fiction with &#34;*The Vegetarian*,&#34; an unsettling novel in which a woman&#39;s decision to stop eating meat has devastating consequences. Kang is the first South Korean author to be nominated for the Man Booker. The book was translated from the Korean by Deborah Smith.</description>

      <description>Sponsor Lisa Richesson has an incredible story to tell in her book White Lady, Black Sons, one that explains Seattle&amp;rsquo;s racist past through her direct experience. Lisa, a white woman, had two children with a black man. One, when she was a teenager, was put up for adoption.
The first chapter of the book, which you can read on our Sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page, goes back even earlier to the first time she became aware of race, and just what happened in her cloistered white Catholic community when she became friends with a young black girl.</description>

      <description>Are you interested in Lindy West the person? Or are you interested in the feminist issues Lindy West frequently discusses, such as fat acceptance? That answer will tell you how much youâll enjoy her new book Shrill.
I went into Shrill expecting a book making the case for feminist causes. As a professional, West is primarily known for that work, such as her wildly viral Jezebel piece, âHow to Make a Rape Joke.</description>

      <description>I came to Geek Love late in life â just a couple of years ago when I was 36, as I tackled edits on my own novel. Iâd heard of Katherine Dunn for years, of course, but I was totally surprised by the weirdness in her work. Everything in Geek Love felt like a madwomanâs treasure hunt, complete with freaks, carnivals, flippers, Siamese twins, fetish strip clubs, and â yowzah â limb amputation.</description>

      <description>As I said in my introductory Bookstore of the Month piece about Queen Anne Book Company, the store is relatively small when compared to some of Seattleâs other neighborhood bookstores, but its stock seems remarkably deep, as though itâs got the stock of a bookstore two to four times the size squeezed inside of it. Itâs the kind of store that leaves you marveling at how much they do have, which is essential for a bookstore; those stores that leave you marveling at what they donât carry do not tend to last that long.</description>

      <description>This is a big one: Seattle author Elissa Washuta is receiving $25,000 in no-strings-attached funds for the Artist Trust 2016 Arts Innovator Award. (The other AIA winner this year is performer, writer, and musician Ahamefule J. Oluo, who will also probably write a book one day.) It&amp;rsquo;s been a big year for Washuta, who also recently won the Fremont Bridge Writer-in-Residence title.
Along with the announcement of the award, Artist Trust announced that The Dale and Leslie Chihuly Foundation have committed to continue funding the Arts Innovator Award for another three years, through 2019.</description>

      <description>Democracies end when they are too democratic. A long piece from Andrew Sullivan about democracy under populism, and how Trump works into all of it.  Many contend, of course, that American democracy is actually in retreat, close to being destroyed by the vastly more unequal economy of the last quarter-century and the ability of the very rich to purchase political influence. This is Bernie Sandersâs core critique. But the past few presidential elections have demonstrated that, in fact, money from the ultrarich has been mostly a dud.</description>

Yesterday, it was announced that animator and cartoonist Darwyn Cooke was suffering from aggressive cancer and receiving palliative care. This morning, his family shared the news that Cooke had died. He was so damn talented, and he died way too young.
Cooke&amp;rsquo;s work has been hugely influential; many people who don&amp;rsquo;t even know his name have seen and enjoyed his storytelling work. He started as a storyboard artist on the phenomenal Batman animated series, and then he went on to work on the Batman Beyond cartoon, including the iconic title sequence for the show.</description>

      <description>Sorry for the late notice, but today at 4:30 pm, Seattle author Nicola Griffith will join Riva Lehrer to discus disabilities in arts and culture. Griffith is a SRoB favorite, and disabilities and the arts are not discussed very often in this town. So if you&amp;rsquo;re free this afternoon, you should head up to the Odegaard Undergraduate Library for this event.
 This morning, the editors of The Toast announced that the site will be ending on July 1st.</description>

      <description>*Every Friday, Cienna Madrid offers solutions to lifeâs most vexing literary problems. Do you need a book recommendation to send your worst cousin on her birthday? Is it okay to read erotica on public transit? Cienna can help. Send your questions to* advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.
**Dear Cienna,**
**What&#39;s the proper way to tell my aging father that if he gifts his art book collection, which I&#39;ve been coveting my whole life and which made me go into arts curation, to my little brother who thinks he deserves everything, that I&#39;m going to bring him back to life just so I can kill him again?</description>

      <description>Katherine Dunn, the Oregon-based author of the incredible novel Geek Love, has died. Geek Love is one of those life-changing novels, the kind of misfit literature that inspires people to drop everything and become writers. (Lynda Barry&amp;rsquo;s wonderful novel Cruddy, for example, would probably not exist without Geek Love.) Rather than reading a bunch of online reminiscences, I&amp;rsquo;d urge you to read this OregonLive story from 2009 about how Dunn fought off a mugger:</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Book Expo America officially launched in Chicago. BEA is the biggest, loudest trade book show in the United States; it&amp;rsquo;s when all the big publishers announce their biggest, splashiest projects and the industry looks ahead at the year to come. Publishing Perspectives just ran an overview of a report on the global state of e-books. And how are e-books doing? Not so great. In fact, the word &amp;ldquo;stalled&amp;rdquo; comes to mind.</description>

      <description>The illustrations in the new comic from Kaare Andrews, Renato Jones The One%, resemble Frank Millerâs artworkÂ â particularly from his Dark Knight Returns era. Throughout, you&amp;rsquo;ll find chiaroscuro layouts and plenty of exaggerated, pinched facial expressions. Andrews has bitten Millerâs style in just about every way imaginable. But Andrewsâs art, once you look deeper than the surface, doesnât really have any life to it; his art resembles Millerâs without the years of hard labor that made Miller such an icon.</description>

The Fight for Fifteen explains how we embraced $15 locally, and many of the major players behind the wage increase â Councilmember Kshama Sawant, fast food worker Martina Phelps, and venture capitalist (and, full disclosure, my boss) Nick Hanauer â were on stage to discuss what they learned and what&amp;rsquo;s coming next.</description>

      <description>Last week, you might recall that GiveBIG, the Seattle Foundationâs huge annual Seattle-area nonprofit fundraising drive, suffered from big problems. The new payment processor for the drive, an organization called Kimbia, completely failed, making it impossible for people to donate to their charities of choice. (Though GiveBIG is a local event, it is part of a national program called âGive Local America,â and many other regions reported the exact same troubles as Seattle.</description>

      <description>In the 1990s, feminists drew lines between a pair of up-and-coming magazines: in many social circles, you could either be a fan of Bitch Magazine, or you could be into Bust. Bitch was uglier than Bust, less glossy. Bitch was interested in feminist theory and it reviled the concept of selling out; Bust was more fun, more inclusive. Bitch had way more words per page, and fewer celebrity interviews. Bust got a fancy book deal and great placement on Bordersâ newsstands around the country; Bitch was often tucked in the back of the racks, with the philosophy magazines and some of the weirder subcultural signifiers like The Comics Journal.</description>

      <description>Sherman Alexie, Seattle&amp;rsquo;s most prominent authorâ¢, promoted his brand-new book for kids, Thunder Boy Jr., on Comedy Central last night. He talked with Daily Show host Trevor Noah about the problems of being a Junior, Crazy Horse&amp;rsquo;s childhood name, Andrew Jackson, and the name of Washington DC&amp;rsquo;s football team.    Speaking of Alexie, yesterday Seattle Arts and Lectures made a very exciting announcement via Twitter:  ANNOUNCEMENT: @Sherman_Alexie to curate &amp;amp; host a new 3-part SAL series focused on authors he loves.</description>

      <description>On Saturdays, I go for Really Long Walks. Iâve been doing this for so long now that itâs become a necessary part of my weekly routine; if I donât get a Really Long Walk in on a Saturday, Iâm miserable and antsy and annoyed for all the next week. Twenty thousand steps, or roughly ten miles, is the bare minimum, but Iâm usually happiest if I can squeeze double that into a day.</description>

      <description>Of the thousands of Devos, it was not so difficult to pick the ones that would make music.
&amp;ast; There were at this time the castle-dwelling Devos, the confrontational Devos, the hundreds of philosophical Devos, and (up the stairs and to your right) the non-quiet Devos.
&amp;ast; Terrible news was when some not-insignificant portion of Devos (the Cornish hen Devos, the table-setting Devos, the world-weary Devos) would at once disappear, Atlantis-like.</description>

      <description>Paige Cornwell at the Seattle Times wrote about how Seattle Public Schools doesn&amp;rsquo;t fund its libraries.
In Seattle, the differences in libraries between have- and have-not schools are most extreme at the elementary level, with $28 per student separating the lowest- and highest-funded schools, according to the librariansâ survey.
The members of that group wonât say which schools are at the top and bottom because they agreed, as they collected information, not to reveal the schoolsâ names.</description>

On Saturday, hundreds of people flooded into the Hugo House to take part in a public celebration of one of the most important literary spaces in Seattle. Though the House will host a few more literary events between now and the old building&amp;rsquo;s demolition, Saturday&amp;rsquo;s party certainly marked some sort of an end. Someone described it to me as a wake, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem quite right; I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to a wake where they played AC/DC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Thunderstruck&amp;rdquo; at high volume.</description>

      <description>There has been a bookstore on top of Queen Anne hill almost continuously since 1998. Queen Anne Books, the bookstore that was the precursor to (our Bookstore of the Month) Queen Anne Book Company, changed hands once since its founding and moved roughly half a block north. Three years ago, the store closed for several months before reopening under the slightly modified name and new ownership. One of the points of continuity between Queen Anne Books and Queen Anne Book Company was bookseller Wendee Wieking, who has been working for the organization since 2007.</description>

      <description>This past Saturday, Independent Bookstore Day, I interviewed author Shann Ray onstage at [Phinney Books]( http://www.phinneybooks.com/) as part of the ongoing [Dock Street Salon](http://dockstreetpress.com/) reading series. It is impossible to talk about Shann Ray without using sentences that go galumphing off into a long series of ands. Watch this: Shann Ray writes poems and non-fiction, and fiction about masculinity, bar fights, and forgiveness. His debut novel, *American Copper*, was praised by no less a Seattle luminary than Sherman Alexie as âtough, poetic, and beautiful.</description>

Today is the 152nd birthday of Nellie Bly, whose real name was Elizabeth Cochran Seaman. Bly was a journalist in the early 20th century, best known for an undercover investigation into the horrid conditions of mental hospitals, and for an around-the-world trip, to realize the fictional travels of Jules Verne&amp;rsquo;s Around the World in Eighty Days (she did it in seventy-two).</description>

      <description>Save the date: the Seward Park branch of Third Place Books will be having its grand opening party on May 21st and May 22nd. This is super-exciting! It&amp;rsquo;s not every day (or even every year) you get to celebrate the grand opening of a new Seattle bookstore. You can (and should) confirm that you&amp;rsquo;ll be there on the Facebook invite for the weekend.
 Save the date, part 2: on June 2nd, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a sneak preview of a new reading series hosted and curated by Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore.</description>

 If youâre looking for a good book, try the FCBD edition of the first issue of *Archie*, by Mark Waid and Fiona Staples. I reviewed it when it came out back in July of last year.</description>

Last week, we interviewed new-to-Seattle author [Neal Bascomb](http://nealbascomb.com/) for [our New Hire column.]( http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/26/new-hire-neal-bascomb-found-a-community-of-writers-in-seattle/) Yesterday, Bascombâs newest book, a non-fiction Norwegian World War II espionage thriller called [*The Winter Fortress*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780544368057), was officially published. Bascomb is hosting a [launch party at Hugo House tomorrow night](https://hugohouse.org/event/book-launch-party-neal-bascombs-winter-fortress). We talked about the pleasures and pains of research and why his book might appeal to fans of the movie *Red Dawn*.

Seattle is right now trapped in the nether realm between openly mourning the past (see editor Jaimee Garbacikâs Ghosts of Seattle Past project) and openly agitating for the future (see the conversation about how quickly we can get light rail up and running to Ballard.) Tonight, the Hugo House finds itself exactly in between those two polar Seattle extremes, as a kind of SchrÃ¶dingerâs nonprofit writing center. In twelve days, the House moves to its temporary headquarters on First Hill as a two-year guest of the Frye Art Museum while the old structure is demolished to make way for a shiny new facility at the base of five storiesâ worth of condos.</description>

      <description>Okay, so yesterday the GiveBIG website collapsed and died a very public death. Dozens, or hundreds, or thousands of Seattleites who wanted to donate money to their favorite Seattle-area nonprofits were unable to, and those nonprofits were forced to choose between either waiting out the computer problems or sending people to their own sites to donate. (The problem with the latter choice: donations directly to nonprofits wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have access to the large amount of matching funds that are applied to donations through the GiveBIG site.</description>

      <title>A quick note on problems with GiveBIG</title>
      <link>http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/a-quick-note-on-problems-with-givebig/</link>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re always excited to promote GiveBIG every year, but this year it seems that the website is having serious issues. As in, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to donate through the GiveBIG site right now. Many nonprofits are reporting not receiving donations in over an hour, and the Seattle Foundation&amp;rsquo;s calls for people to &amp;ldquo;refresh&amp;rdquo; the site don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be working.
In short: GiveBIG this year is pretty much a clusterfuck. There will for sure be hell to pay in the coming days â this is a big day for Seattle&amp;rsquo;s nonprofit community and this will surely affect the annual income of local organizations across the board.</description>

      <description>The fifteenth annual Free Comic Book Day (FCBD) is this coming Saturday. If youâve never heard of FCBD before, thatâs terrific â you just identified yourself as FCBDâs target audience. Itâs exactly what it sounds like: you can wander into your nearest comic book store (find the address at freecomicbookday.com) and walk out with a handful of free comic books, no strings attached.
Say you pick up some comics on FCBD, and you like them.</description>

      <description>A winner, a swinger, a ringer.
A looker, a loser, an up-on-his-lucker.
Someone looser, someone tighter,
definitely not an all-nighter.Â A whiner,
wine-swiller, someone to entertain
the fundraiser chicken dinner.
Someone with handlers, another with baggage,
one with the umbrellas, another with the rain.
Different faces, symmetrical and un-.
A smoker, a non-, a joker, a song.
Two lungs, a heart, a head, a leg, a leg.
The drink, the dregs.</description>

Today is the sixth annual GiveBIG charitable giving event. The deal with GiveBIG is that for one day out of the year, the Seattle Foundation will stretch your donations to nonprofits with funds of their own. In their last five years, they&amp;rsquo;ve given more than $56 million to Seattle-area nonprofits.
But how do you sift through the dozens of GiveBIG nonprofits to find the organizations who do the work that you&amp;rsquo;re most passionate about?</description>

&amp;mdash; Courtney (@seattlecourtney) May 1, 2016 Iâm not from here. I arrived from New England, in 1993, a grunge-hating, coffee-agnostic seventeen-year-old. Hours in mosh pits covered in other peopleâs sweat and spit while gazing adoringly at Mark Arm taught me to love the music of this place; becoming a sleepless single mother taught me the joy in the local joe. A great deal of the rest of what I know â about the Pacific Northwest and about life â I learned from independent bookstores and the people who love them.</description>

The top of Queen Anne, to me, often feels like an island. The rhythms are different up there than youâll find down on the streets of Seattle. Itâs quieter, a little calmer. Maybe thatâs why Queen Anne Book Company, our May Bookstore of the Month, feels a little bit like an island bookstore: itâs small, but itâs incredibly well-stocked for a store of its size. Bookstores on islands have to have a phenomenal collection of books, because they canât rely on luxuries like next-day shipping or conveniently located book distributors the way mainland bookstores do.</description>

      <description>Uncanny Valley I have mixed feelings about this form &amp;mdash; we&amp;rsquo;ve seen them before, notes from inside the boom industry. It&amp;rsquo;s personal essay, not reportage, it&amp;rsquo;s a confession from the one who accepted the paycheck and now feels that the price of this betrayal to their college idealism is exposure of their lush corporate lifestyle. We&amp;rsquo;ve read them from inside Wall Street and Hollywood, Real Estate, and now the tech boom.</description>

      <description>After you&amp;rsquo;ve celebrated Independent Bookstore Day tomorrow, I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll come out to Phinney Books for a special edition of the Dock Street Salon. Spokane author Shann Ray, who wrote the novel American Copper, will read and then he and I will be in conversation. Copper is a novel about Montana in the early 20th century, and Ray has very interesting things to say about masculinity. He also, according to his bio, &amp;ldquo;teaches leadership and forgiveness studies at Gonzaga University,&amp;rdquo; which is absolutely fascinating.</description>

      <description>Ricky Jay is a collector. If you&amp;rsquo;ve followed his career, even in periphery, you know that his magic, his acting, his public masquerade are but spokes on the hub of his true passion: the acquisition, study, and understanding of rare magical and performatory tomes, ephemera, and lore. Mr. Jay is a scholar of such, but he is not an academic or bound to an institution apart from one of his own making.</description>

**Dear Cienna,**
I&amp;rsquo;m a bookseller at an independent bookstore in Seattle. (No, not that one.) I&amp;rsquo;m used to people having bad taste when it comes to books, but every time someone buys an adult coloring book from me, I become irrationally mad.</description>

      <description>You never stop reciting certain lines from certain poems. Whether battered into your head through schoolroom platforms, or the kind of reading every poetry lover experiences: reading, and then that heart-stopping feeling of your mind bending to the poet&amp;rsquo;s will. The special effects in the movie Inception are familiar to the poetry lover, we feel that world spin every now and again.
And that spin turns into mantra, the quoted line a straight shot to a pattern of synaptic syntactic firing, a shorthand for the feeling: comfort, curiosity, wonder, regret.</description>

      <title>Thursday Comics Hangover: Super weird</title>

      <description>Superhero comics are supremely weird. What started out as a simple formula âÂ every issue features a fight by page seven, a little bit of soap opera, and the beginning, middle, and end of a battle between good and evil âÂ has now become a weirdly self-reflexive vocabulary that pretty much is only used to describe itself. Even as superhero movies have become the most popular genre at the multiplex, itâs hard to understand modern superhero comics without comparing them against years of knowledge of the genre.</description>

      <description>I just want to call your attention to what should be a magnificent book event tonight. Poet Kevin Young is giving a craft talk at the Hugo House starting at 7 pm. Young is one of the very best American poets; his last collection, Book of Hours, destroyed me with its raw depiction of grief. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the best collections I&amp;rsquo;ve read in recent memory. (You can read my review here.</description>

Billie Swift knew she was heading toward a defining moment when she heard that John Marshall, the owner of Open Books, was planning to retire. Swift is on her way to completing the MFA at the Rainier Creative Writing Workshop at Pacific Lutheran University this year, and so she was already at a crossroads in her life. What did Swift feel when she first read Marshallâs email? âPanic,â she laughs over the phone, and an âimmediate sadness.</description>

      <description>When the Mall del Norte branch of B. Dalton booksellers closed in January of 2010, CNN reported, the city of Laredo (population 250,000) became the largest American city without a bookstore. âThe closest bookstore is now 150 miles away, in San Antonio, Texas,â wrote CNNâs Ed Lavandera. Laredo was likely just the first of many American bookstore deserts, as Barnes &amp;amp; Noble continues to falter with every quarterly earnings report and rural retail zones get sucked dry by Walmart and Amazon.</description>

Thank you to the Office of Arts &amp; Culture Seattle for giving me this amazing opportunity. I will be posting again soon to ask for stories to help me with this project.</description>

      <description>It was published earlier this month, but I just saw it now: YA novelist John Green&amp;rsquo;s response to his book Looking for Alaska landing on top of the year&amp;rsquo;s most-challenged book list is pretty damn good. That last line is downright scathing:
 Something I will never understand: when will these book-banning schmucks realize that the best way to get kids excited about a book is to try to ban it?</description>

For as long as Seattle has been a city, people have come to town and people have left town. The *Seattle Review of Books* has a recurring feature called [Exit Interview](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/exit-interview-talking-with-kate-lebo-about-why-she-left-seattle-for-spokane/), in which we talk with an author who recently left town about their Seattle experience. The natural pair to that feature is New Hire, an interview with an author whoâs just arrived here.

The rumors are true: we at the Seattle Review of Books are incredibly excited to be presenting a show at Bumbershoot this year! When Bumbershoot asked us to program an hour on their Words and Ideas stage, we decided to ask three Seattle-area poets known for their awesome performance skills to share a stage for the first time ever. Happily, all three said yes.
EJ Koh wowed us at last year&amp;rsquo;s Lit Crawl with her clarity, stage presence, and incisive poems.</description>

      <description>By the way some people write around here, you&amp;rsquo;d think that only one person wrote around here. I also did a blurb about where I write, for Hugo House. I kept it short, but I did a much more in-depth look at my studio when I ran my Kickstarter last year.
In my studio, I write fiction, I work on the Seattle Review of Books, and I ship copies of my novel California Four O&amp;rsquo;Clock.</description>

*(Once in a while, I take a new book with me to lunch and give it a half an hour or so to grab my attention. Lunch Date is my judgment on that speed-dating experience.)*
**Whoâs your date today?** *All the Birds in the Sky*, the bestselling novel written by i09 editor-in-chief Charlie Jane Anders.
**Whereâd you go?** [The Sunlight CafÃ© in Roosevelt]( http://sunlightcafevegetarian.com/).
**Whatâd you eat?** I had the large portion of the blueberry yogurt hotcakes ($9.</description>

      <description>Sometimes when Iâm feeling saucy, Iâll ask a bookstore owner to choose a book or two to represent their store. Itâs a hard question to answer: how is it possible to reflect the character, staffing, and stock of an entire bookstore with a single book? Itâs a question that has broken some booksellers; they shrug, or name a dozen books, or promise to get back to me and never do.</description>

      <description>We reported at the beginning of this month that Open Books owner John Marshall was in the &amp;ldquo;closing stages&amp;rdquo; of selling his poetry bookshop to a new owner. The closing stages have finally closed, and in an email to customers last night, Marshall finally revealed the new owner&amp;rsquo;s name:
We are exceedingly happy to announce that **the next owner of Open Books: A Poem Emporium will be Billie Swift**. She has been an avid customer for years, has a sharp and inquiring mind, and is a truly engaging soul.</description>

      <description>The Real Story of How Amazon Built the Echo A long piece by Joshua Brustein in Bloomberg about how the Echo came to be, and how it came to be a hit, despite pundits prognosticating sure failure.
 When it launched, Amazonâs critics jumped to mock the company. Some called it a useless gimmick; others pointed to it as evidence of Amazonâs Orwellian tendencies. Then something weird happened: People decided they loved it.</description>

You can see the full announced slate on SALâs site and buy tickets for most of the authors right now. Itâs a big, splashy, ambitious list; all the authors are worth your consideration, but Iâd like to highlight a few personal favorites that you might consider checking out when they come to town.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a super-interesting introduction to a great (and newly local) talent. Hanselmann is signing his new Fantagraphics title Megg &amp;amp; Mogg In Amsterdam and Other Stories at the Fantagraphics Bookstore and Gallery tomorrow; you should obviously go.
 Have you also read about the time Prince donated $12,000 to a library in Louisville because it &amp;ldquo;was the first full-service free public library in the nation open to African-Americans?</description>

      <description>The Face is a new series of book-length essays centered around an interesting theme: in each volume, an author writes about their own face. Itâs an idea that at once seems expansive as the horizon and as claustrophobic as a broom closet. When meeting strangers, we look to their face for hints of inner character, but we also chastise people for being too narcissistic if they seem overly obsessed with their own appearance.</description>

It was kind of a boring new comics Wednesday from the mainstream publishers, so I decided to dive into the minicomics section of Phoenix Comics &amp;amp; Games to see what local cartoonists are working on. Or, in one case, what local cartoonists were working on; I had never seen the 2014 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fanzine Notorious R.B.G. before, so it was new to me. (It also predated the 2015 Christmas bestseller Notorious R.</description>

      <description>We told you about this a couple weeks ago, and thankfully sanity has prevailed:
The Tennessee House of Representatives failed Wednesday to override Gov. Bill Haslamâs veto of a bill to make the Bible the official state book.
Haslam, a Republican, vetoed the Bible bill last week, saying he felt the bill âtrivializes the Bible.â

      <description>Last week, I asked people to share their experience with this year&amp;rsquo;s Emerald City Comicon. Over the last few days, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard from local cartoonists, from comics professionals, and from people who attended the show as fans. From those conversations, a pattern has emerged.
People are, so far as I can tell, pretty happy with Emerald City Comicon, especially as compared with other large comic book conventions. In fact, the more conventions that someone attends every year, the more likely they are to appreciate ECCC.</description>

      <description>**Wednesday April 20: David SchmaderÂ **
Itâs true that I worked with David Schmader for years at *The Stranger*, and itâs true that Iâm proud to call him my friend. But there is a part of my brain â the part that tingles when it comes across a sufficiently beautiful sentence â that is still in awe of his writing ability. If you havenât read his now-defunct Last Days column or seen his live *Showgirls* performance, you might think itâs hyperbole when I say that Schmader is the single funniest man Iâve ever met.</description>

      <description>Itâs a hateful job, delivering news of death: the fact of its very existence, its unexpected arrival, its sudden probability. Itâs heavy enough just to describe how it feels for the whole idea to swirl in, like a loaded paintbrush tainting the water in a jar. In her latest memoir, What Comes Next and How to Like It, released in paperback today, Abigail Thomas reluctantly and humanely shoulders the job, âjust poking at death with a long stick to see what happens.</description>

Fantagraphics Books is the most-nominated company of the year, with a whopping 17 nods. (One of Fantagraphics&amp;rsquo; most-nominated titles is The Eternaut, which I reviewed here at the Seattle Review of Books back in December.)
Other Seattle-area nominees include The Oatmeal&amp;rsquo;s Matthew Inman, who was nominated for his strip &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Going to Be Okay,&amp;rdquo; and G.</description>

I had to ask my brother
how do I take a knife
to the sharpener
one chance not to ruin
the flesh of this tuna I wanted
to separate the head
and dissolve the eye into
powder on my tongue I said
something about a fire worried
about dying in a fire in this club
with these people she said
âWhere I come from that isnât funnyâ</description>

      <description>I stop at Mercer Street Books to pick up the review copy of Lunatics, Lovers and Poets. Where to read it? Which restaurant? Where? Too many cars, too loud, I donât want to cross the street. Irish pub? No, itâs too dark, too much dark wood, in the middle of our block I avoid the selva oscura. Floydâs! Floydâs? Itâs gone! How about Mecca, thatâll work, but thatâs all the way round.</description>

Of course, thereâs more to a bookstore than readings. As John Marshall reflects on his time with Open Books, heâs been thinking about how much heâs learned from his customers. âI have been educated in so many directions by articulate folks possessing a vast array of aesthetics,â he says. He learns about poets and events from customers all the time, and all those many voices have helped make Open Books a two-decade conversation, with the kind of âcrackling moments of wit,â he says, âthat make life glow.</description>

      <description>&#39;I Don&#39;t Know Whether to Kiss You or Spank You&#39;: A Half Century of Fear of an Unspanked Woman Yet another longform piece on the infantalization of women due to the patriarchy as represented by media expressions of spanking as punishment (but not sexual pleasure). Jeez. Seems like we&amp;rsquo;re getting ten of these a week, these days. Andrew Heisel takes us well-in-hand with this one, from Jezebel.
 In early 1946, a woman from Carmel, California wrote the Hollywood fan magazine _Screenland_ to say how much she had enjoyed the recent Christmas release _Frontier Gal_ &amp;mdash; not just for its lovely performers and dazzling Technicolor vistas, but for saving her marriage by teaching her husband to spank her.</description>

      <description>I thought I might go nuts if I read another article about how a woman writer balances her art and family commitments, but Danielle Duttonâs ability to balance multiple projects verges on superhuman. So I had to ask.
Dutton is the founder and publisher of Dorothy, a Publishing Project; a tenure-track professor; author of two novels and a collection of short stories as well as a doting mother with the âbest kid ever.</description>

      <description>Canadian cartoonist Chester Brown reads from his new book *Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus: Prostitution and Religious Obedience in the Bible* on [Saturday, April 16th at 7 pm at the Hugo House](https://hugohouse.org/event/book-party-for-chester-browns-mary-wept-over-the-feet-of-jesus/). Both of the *Seattle Review of Books* co-founders, Paul Constant and Martin McClellan, read the book, and it left them with a lot of conflicted feelings. The following is a conversation they had on a Google Doc as they tried to determine what it was about *Mary* that left them feeling so strangely dissatisfied.</description>

      <description>Last weekâs big book news was obviously the first issue of the Black Panther from Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreeze, but there was another debut that deserves your attention, too. Nick Spencer and Steve Lieberâs new series The Fix is a crime comic with relatively small stakes, but itâs entertaining as hell â funny, dirty, and charming all at once.
Spencer and Lieber earned a cult following with their work on Marvelâs Superior Foes of Spider-Man series, which was a funny heist comic featuring some D-List Spider-Man villains.</description>

      <description>This quote, from BuzzFeed chairman Ken Lerer, positively smacks of protesting too much:
âAnyone who thinks that this isnât a terrific time to be in digital content is dead wrong,â Lerer said. â**Itâs a fantastic time**.â Lerer, of course, is talking about the reports that BuzzFeed had to cut its revenue goals for this year by half. Also of note is this line, from Re/Code reporter Peter Kafka, later in the piece:</description>

      <description>**Wednesday April 13: Hope JahrenÂ **
*Lab Girl* is a memoir about sexism in the sciences â the STEM fields are still an old boysâ club â and what itâs like to follow a lifelong love of science. To Jahren, math and analytic thinking isnât the most important part of being a scientist; having a question is what counts most. *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5.

David Schmader is a goddamned Seattle treasure. From his one-man shows to his Last Days column at *The Stranger* to his new job as [Creative Director at the Bureau of Fearless Ideas](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/27/an-interview-with-david-schmader-the-brand-new-creative-director-at-the-bureau-of-fearless-ideas/), he has improved life in this city by roughly 1000 percent. I worked with Schmader for eight years at *The Stranger* and I&#39;m proud to call him a friend, but the truth is that I still nurse a fan&#39;s awe of his writing.</description>

      <description>Humans have enjoyed marijuana for about 12,000 years. It is now recreationally legal in four states and medically legal in roughly half of the country. In America, 18.9 million have sparked a joint in the past 30 days.
I first sampled the wonders of weed while attending San Rafael High School, the northern California institution of learning that introduced the term â420â to the popular vernacular in the early 1970s. Over the ensuing decades, I have enjoyed a steady relationship with the kind herb.</description>

      <description>I always forget who lives
in my city.
No comment on them &amp;mdash;
my memoryâs bad.
Or good
for certain things.
Like faces.
Or items
on a grocery list.
Or the precise feelings
a book produced
in me once,
although perhaps not
its phrases or ideas.
But people, you
lovely impenetrables,
too often I forget
you exist.
I donât find it hard
to reach out to you
in moments &amp;mdash;</description>

      <title>Growing pains for Emerald City Comicon?</title>

      <description>This year was the first Emerald City Comicon under the management of national convention chain ReedPOP, and the local comics community was understandably nervous about what that might mean for the regionâs largest convention. ECCC director Jim Demonakos assured the media last year that ReedPOP wouldnât affect the flavor of the convention at all, but comics people are resistant to change and prone to worry, so everyone had their feelers out for problems.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re in the Orthodox church, Easter is still ahead, on May 1st this year. We&amp;rsquo;re welcoming back sponsor Charlotte Riggle, whose children&amp;rsquo;s book Catherine&amp;rsquo;s Pascha follows a little girl&amp;rsquo;s quest to stay awake for the overnight Pascha, or Easter, service.
If you&amp;rsquo;re not Orthodox, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll be wondering why the family next door are loading up the car with sleepy children all dressed up come April 30th. This book is a great way of understanding the faith of your neighbors and friends, and introducing children to the many ways that different people in the world worship.</description>

      <description>Singapore is especially difficult for Westerners to understand. People who visit come back like a blind man from the parable of the elephant, convinced that the trunk they felt represents the whole of the place.
Infamously, William Gibson wondered where the underground was when he visited in 1993 and wrote his Wired essay &amp;ldquo;Disneyland with the Death Penalty&amp;rdquo;. He lamented, among other things, the loss of the red light district.</description>

As Open Books owner John Marshall prepares his poetry bookstore for a new owner and a new future, he canât help but reflect on the past. Between the old friends sending their best wishes on news of Marshallâs retirement and the prospect of retirement, he describes himself as feeling a little âsentimental.â
âIâm getting lovely memories,â Marshall says. In particular, heâs been remembering some of the liveliest events Open Books has hosted over the last two decades.</description>

      <description>The Voyeur&#39;s Motel Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Gay Talese. When asked last week to name female journalists he admired, he balked, then doubled-down. Not using Twitter, or any social media, a New York Times piece reported that Talese was unaware of the controversy his words inspired until informed a few days later. After that reporting, the New York Times Public Editor responded to the Time&amp;rsquo;s executive editor Dean Baquet talking smack about the very artice.</description>

      <description>Over at The Inlander, I wrote a piece about Seattle memoirist Elissa Washuta, who&amp;rsquo;ll be reading at Get Lit!, Spokane&amp;rsquo;s wonderful annual book festival. We talked about the distinction of being a memoirist versus being an essayist, whether people got mad at Washuta for the way they were presented in her memoir, and what the most surprising thing about publishing a memoir. I love introducing Seattle&amp;rsquo;s authors to new audiences; I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll go take a look at the piece.</description>

This is our pick for the best event of the evening; CW&amp;amp;P is a consistently great event, and this is its last time on the Hugo House stage before the House is demolished later this year. Further, the future of CW&amp;amp;P â and the answer to the question of whether CW&amp;amp;P even has a future â has not yet been announced.</description>

      <description>The first issue of Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreezeâs Black Panther was published yesterday, and it was one of those rare moments â like the time DC Comics killed Superman, back in the 1990s â when people who never go to comic book stores suddenly care about a single issue of a comic 1. The staff at Phoenix Comics yesterday estimated that theyâd be sold out of all five dozen copies of the comic on their shelves by the end of the day.</description>

      <description>The debut party for Lesley Hazleton&amp;rsquo;s Agnostic: A Spirited Manifesto last night at Town Hall was a fantastic experience. Hazleton delivered a talk that was part-extemporaneous/part-reading. Hazleton asked the audience to imagine that she held the sun in her hand, that it was about the size of an orange; the Earth, she said, would be a grain of salt circling her hand at 30 feet. The nearest star to our sun would be another orange, approximately in Big Sur.</description>

And consider too that if you simply hang up, as youâre likely to do if you consider this an absurdly simplistic question, you donât count either.â Hazleton is explaining why polls usually indicate that Americans are such devout believers in God; if you force someone to make a binary choice, all nuance and shading simply disappears.</description>

      <title>Tennessee to name an official state book</title>
      <link>http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/tennessee-to-name-an-official-state-book/</link>

      <description>I am all for the idea of states naming official books. (Make Way for Ducklings is, adorably, Massachusetts&amp;rsquo;s official children&amp;rsquo;s book.) But I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of this move:
Tennessee is poised to make history as the first state in the nation to recognize the Holy Bible as its official book. The problem is, of course, Tennessee lawmakers aren&amp;rsquo;t just naming a state book by doing this; they&amp;rsquo;re effectively naming Christianity the official state religion.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s funny how much we ate &amp;mdash;
we couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop.
First dinner, then desert,
then the plates and the table.
At the show, she ate the stage,
I swallowed the microphones.
Back at the room we ate the chairs
the shower and the television.
Naked, breasts poised like the dark mystery
at the center of faith, she devoured the bed &amp;mdash;
nothing left.
Behind her, arms around her victorious stomach,</description>

      <description>Now that I am home and eating real meals again, there is time to mull over all the cringey moments of AWP 2016. Like when I bum-rushed Kevin Young in order to gush about how much my middle school students loved his poem âOde to Gumbo.â I actually said, âyouâve got fans in the 8th grade, Kevin.â And then ran away. Or when I stood right behind Rachel Kushner at a small private reception, stared at her hair and, like a super creep, didnât say anything.</description>

      <description>*Editor&#39;s note: critic [Tom LeClair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_LeClair) sent this letter to the editor in response to [Paul Constant&#39;s blog post](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/29/book-reviewer-predictably-upset-at-authors-big-advance/) on LeClair&#39;s* Daily Beast *piece titled &#34;[Will Commercialit Ruin Great Fiction?](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/27/will-commercialit-ruin-great-fiction.html)&#34;*
In the 40 years Iâve been writing book reviews for national periodicals, itâs rare that one of my reviews is reviewed. In a recent post, Paul Constant called my review of Sweeneyâs The Nest in the Daily Beast âunfair.â âWrongâ I could silently accept, but âunfairâ seems unfair.</description>

As the Seattle Review of Books reported back at the beginning of March, John Marshall, owner of the Wallingford poetry-only bookshop Open Books, announced that he was retiring from the bookselling business. In an email to his customers, Marshall indicated that he wanted to sell the bookstore, that sales at Open Books were still strong, and that he believed a new owner could even make something more of the store.</description>

      <description>Correspondant Rachel Kessler agreed to be our eyes-on-the-ground at the AWP festival this year. Join us for her daily updates as the conference unfolds.
The final day of AWP produces a noticeable thrum from inside the hive. Up and down the teal conference center hallways 14,000 attendees power walk and talk and gesticulate wildly, swinging beige tote bags with great vigor. Drinking fountains were in short supply, although the dehydrated could quench their thirst at one of the many cocktail carts that popped up at noon throughout the venue.</description>

      <description>Is This the End of the Era of the Important, Inappropriate Literary Man?  Jia Tolentino, in a long detailed article in Jezebel, goes inside the Iowa Writers Workshop to examine a man accused. She looks both from the perspective of how historically many men in power used their position for sexual privilege with students, but also how the method of accusation should support believing women, but maybe with a higher bar than anonymity.</description>

      <description>Correspondant Rachel Kessler agreed to be our eyes-on-the-ground at the AWP festival this year. Join us for her daily updates as the conference unfolds.
Friday morning at AWP many attendees are moving slowly. Bloodshot eyes abound at the bookfair. This is a result of the many opportunities to drink, dance and attend offsite readings at places like The Ace Hotelâs rooftop deck, featuring a pool the size of a postage stamp that no one was âswimmingâ in, until suddenly it was full of dudes in what looked like their underwear.</description>

      <description>In 1994, Dan Clowes had recently completed his first attempt at a longform comic story, the surrealistic Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron, and he had just embarked on his most realistic story to date, Ghost World. If you were to tap a Clowes fan on the shoulder in those days and tell her that in the future, Clowes would create a graphic novel that identifies him visually as an heir to superhero comics icons Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, she would either laugh at you, tell you youâre making shit up, or inform you that strangers tapping her on the shoulder and making weird predictions in public places make her very uncomfortable.</description>

The AWP, which stands for Association of Writers and Writing Programs, is the big annual literary conference that takes place in a different city each year. This year it is happening in downtown LA, right next to the Lakers home court. The three-day conference includes readings, panel discussions, pedagogy talks, educator caucuses, and countless offsite events, like poetry pool parties, as well as a sprawling bookfair with hundred of authors signing.</description>

      <description>The Seattle Review of Books is looking for a freelance Public Diversity Editor. Since that&amp;rsquo;s a term we just made up, we should probably explain what it is.
We&amp;rsquo;re two white guys. One of our goals with the site was to try to do a good job with representation, to create a site that reflects the diversity of the literary community. We thought one way to guard against us succumbing to our own unconscious biases would be to hire an outside person to check our work and report back to our readers.</description>

      <description>In case you were staring out at sunny skies and planning what to do this weekend, let me just make one thing abundantly clear: *Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice* is every bit as terrible as youâve heard. It is not so-bad-itâs-good. Itâs just bad: inept, crass, soulless, mean-spirited, and dumb. Donât pay money to see it.
But this isnât another review of that movie (the world doesnât need any more of those)Â and itâs not another middle-aged white dude whining about his childhood being stolen from him (the world didnât need one of those).</description>

      <description>Shelf Awareness reports that local book distributor Partners/West is closing. The Renton office will stop delivering books on April 1st. This is a huge bummer; it means that local bookstores in need of rush titles will have to rely on Ingram, the largest book distributor in the country. Though most bookstores try to order direct from publishers whenever possible because the discounts are better, distributors are the best way for bookstores to get books in a hurry.</description>

      <description>Cynthia DâAprix Sweeney read from her debut novel The Nest at Elliott Bay Book Company last night. I didn&amp;rsquo;t attend because I had writing to do. (Nothing takes away from your time to attend readings, I&amp;rsquo;ve found, like co-founding a book review site.) This review by Tom LeClair at the Daily Beast makes me wish I had gone to Sweeney&amp;rsquo;s reading â not because the review is so good, but because it&amp;rsquo;s so unfair that I wish I could have shown up to personally apologize to Sweeney on behalf of book reviewers everywhere.</description>

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the lightning bolt hitting the right arm
at a right angle, the bees pouring
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;from an overturned truck, the crocodile
that escaped on a lawn, sipping lemonade.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is all to say: we did not mean to let
the road break in half. We laid down layers
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of asphalt in the tradition of weavers.

      <description>This is the most perfect thing for an election year. Sponsor Entre Rios books, who makes those lovely poetry volumes that are so beautiful in the hand, is back to show off their upcoming collection of Percy Bysse Shelley&amp;rsquo;s political poems.
What? Didn&amp;rsquo;t you know that Shelley wrote political poems? They were not collected until after his death, and were often passed around hand-to-hand in activist circles. We&amp;rsquo;ve got a sample page and sample poem on our sponsors page.</description>

      <description>Are e-books the solution to our education crisis? Not so fast, says Juanita Giles at the Washington Post:  Even if our poorest schools had broadband and ample devices, believing that free e-books are the key to ending our literacy crisis is dangerously misguided. Technology is repeatedly touted as a cure for the United Statesâ educational woes, promising everything from banishing boredom to widespread reform. Interactive whiteboards were the hope a few years ago, and Google Earth was supposed to make our children masters of geography.</description>

      <description>Last weekendâs 39th annual Norwescon, as per usual, was the most fun a human being could possibly have in SeaTac. The sci-fi convention never fell for the media bombast and glitz that comic book conventions became enchanted by a decade ago; itâs always been a convention for fans and by fans, which means itâs a rare opportunity for writers and readers to get together in a low-stress, friendly environment.
The belle of the ball this year was Seattle author Ramez Naam, whose novel Apex won the Philip K.</description>

      <description>Jim Harrison, the prolific half-blind masculinist writer of many books of fiction and poetry, has died at 78.
Harrison was perhaps the last of a certain kind of writer, a craggy individualist compared often (to his apparent annoyance) to Hemingway and Faulkner; a man of great appetites (of which food should be included, as he wrote extensively on the subject), an outdoorsman, and, as might be imagined, an iconoclast of the particular rugged American variety.</description>

      <description>Legalize It All Dan Baum exploded the internet with his opening paragraphs of this piece about legalizing drugs, but the rest of it is worth spending time with.
 At the time, I was writing a book about the politics of drug prohibition. I started to ask Ehrlichman a series of earnest, wonky questions that he impatiently waved away. âYou want to know what this was really all about?â he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect.</description>

      <description>In an essay called âOn Pandering,â author Claire Vaye Watkins claims that, for her entire career, she has been unconsciously assimilating the values of the prejudiced, male-dominated literary community. âI wanted to write something Cormac McCarthy would like,â she says, âsomething Thomas Pynchon would come out of hiding to endorse, something David Foster Wallace would blurb from beyond the grave.â This is coming from the author of the award winning story collection Battleborn, which takes the following as its subjects: young parents embracing the idea of having a child, teenage girls navigating sexual abuse, foreigners in Nevada brothels, gold prospectors, and the Manson Family commune.</description>

      <description>The Japan News reports:
A short-form novel âcoauthoredâ by humans and an artificial intelligence (AI) program passed the first screening process for a domestic literary prize, it was announced on Monday. However, the book did not win the final prize. Some of you out there may interpret this news as apocalyptic. If so, you should be warned that the apocalypse is upon us already: news agencies publish stories written by robots on a regular basis, though this programmer&amp;rsquo;s prediction that a robot would win the Pulitzer by 2016 seems unlikely to come true.</description>

      <description>**Wednesday March 23: Robert Sawyer**
Sawyerâs science fiction novels are about what happens when you introduce one high-concept sci-fi element to an otherwise ordinary world. He then spends the rest of the book examining the ramifications of that collision. His newest, *Quantum Night*, uses experimental psychology and quantum physics to explore human nature.Â *University Book Store, 4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, [bookstore.washington.edu](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu). Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*
**Thursday March 24: Haunted House: A Reading**</description>

      <description>When Seattle novelist Bharti Kirchner was growing up in Kolkata, she writes in the afterword to her new novel Goddess of Fire, she âyearned to learn more about Job Charnock, a faithful servant of the English East India Company in its early days, who was believed to have founded Kolkata (then known as Calcutta).â But not much information about Charnock has survived from 17th century India to the present day. So Kirchner spent a lifetime obsessing over the few facts available, including an account that Charnock saved a young Indian girl from being tossed onto her deceased husbandâs funeral pyre, and eventually married her.</description>

      <description>All poetry is political.
This is not to say that poetry is an especially political form. All poetry is political because all poetry is created by people, and all people are political animals.
And, yes, in fact, poetry is whatever people are: political, sure â but also loving, spiteful, awkward, romantic, horny, judgmental, and overly obsessed with our little glowing screens.
So I guess what Iâm saying here is that all poetry is horny.</description>

      <description>Due to a filing error, we mistakenly attributed a poem by a different poet to Jane Wong. The mistake was entirely ours, and we have deleted the post from the site and social media. We apologize to Jane Wong for the egregious mistake, and to our readers, and weâll put procedures in place to ensure it wonât happen again.</description>

      <description>The (I guess NSFW, maybe?) photograph of the &amp;ldquo;naked language mural&amp;rdquo; by artist Vladimiro Lunardon up at The New Post-Literate is a thing of beauty. It&amp;rsquo;s exactly what reading great literature feels like to me. Lunardon&amp;rsquo;s art employs lots of writing-like imagery, and some of it is really quite beautiful.
 The great Roger Langridge has a new cartoon of &amp;ldquo;Abandoned First Drafts&amp;rdquo; up on his blog for your enjoyment.</description>

      <description>Poetry Northwest is one of Seattle&amp;rsquo;s great treasures &amp;mdash; a journal that&amp;rsquo;s been publishing since 1959. We&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to have them as a sponsor this week. Their upcoming issue &amp;mdash; available the first week of April &amp;mdash; is a must-read. Maybe don&amp;rsquo;t judge it only by its cover, but that image by David Hytone is enough to get us excited. In fact, did you know that none other than Mark Tobey did their early cover art?</description>

      <description>Imagine a world in which booksellers can break into your home and steal back books that you bought from them. That, basically, is a reality with e-books. Chris Meadows wrote for TeleRead an account of how Barnes &amp;amp; Noble &amp;ldquo;stole&amp;rdquo; the first e-book he ever bought. He even contacted Barnes &amp;amp; Noble to complain, and they told him he could re-buy the e-book from them if he wanted. A couple days later, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble did decide to give Meadows back the e-book that he purchased.</description>

      <description>All this month, Iâve been interviewing Seattle-area school librarians. They have, to a person, been delightful interviews: friendly, optimistic, and eager to talk about their work. Almost every one of them told me that they believe they have the best job in the world.
But theyâve also all talked about a problem that plagues every school librarian in Seattle. Itâs a problem that is frankly unbelievable for a modern American city, especially one that considers itself to be as progressive as Seattle does.</description>

      <description>Tonight&amp;rsquo;s APRIL Festival 5th Anniversary Party was a solid mix of new-to-APRIL readers (Hannah Sanghee Park delivered a witty spray of poems about love and &amp;ldquo;going to town on a tangerine&amp;rdquo;) and longtime APRIL favorites (Ed Skoog always classes up a room, even when he&amp;rsquo;s reading a poem about puppets). But they saved the real news for the end of the night: APRIL co-founder Willie Fitzgerald announced that APRIL&amp;rsquo;s managing director, Tara Atkinson, would be stepping down after this year&amp;rsquo;s festival.</description>

      <description>In the end, our bones say a lot about who we were.
Ways of identifying sex lie in the shape of the pelvis, the jaw. If you place a thumb in the socket of a pelvic bone and itâs a tight fit, it belongs to the body of a male; female pelvic sockets are roomier. You can tell if someone was right-handed or left by the extra musculature attached to the dominant side.</description>

      <description>We just received some exciting news from Poetry Northwest, the longest-running poetry magazine in the Pacific Northwest. There are three huge announcements, so let&amp;rsquo;s tease them out in order.
First of all, longtime Poetry Northwest editor Kevin Craft is stepping down. Craft has long been a faithful ambassador, cheerleader, and ringleader of the Northwest&amp;rsquo;s poetry scene. You&amp;rsquo;ll find him in the stands at major poetry events around Seattle all the time, catching up with local poets and making introductions.</description>

      <description>Washington State Poet Laureate Tod Marshall announced that he&amp;rsquo;s looking for new poems (PDF) from Washington poets for a book titled Washington 129. Unsurprisingly, he&amp;rsquo;ll publish one poem from 129 different poets â that&amp;rsquo;s one poet for each year of Washington&amp;rsquo;s statehood. The gist of the announcement:
*Washington 129* is accepting submissions until January 31, 2017. Previously published poems will not be considered. Please submit no more than three poems as a single Microsoft Word attachment or as the body of an email to submissions@humanities.</description>

This is very sad. The good news is that Crispin reads in Seattle tomorrow night from her new book, *The Creative Tarot*. She&#39;ll be [reading at University Book Store at 7 pm, and it&#39;s free](https://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=03&amp;evyear=2016&amp;eventid=2016021108384500). And meanwhile, over at the Rumpus, you should [read this interview with Crispin](http://therumpus.net/2016/03/the-rumpus-interview-with-jessa-crispin/) that, while recorded before the announcement of Bookslut&#39;s closure, certainly seems to offer some foreshadowing to the fact that Crispin is ready to move on: **Rumpus**: Do you dislike American literature?</description>

      <description>Marie Kondo is the gentle ruler of an empire built on a most unusual foundation. Her Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing, published in the US in 2014, is still at the top of the New York Times bestseller list &amp;mdash; right above her just-released Spark Joy. She was one of _Time Magazine_âs People of the Year in 2015. Her immense popularity has drawn coverage in the New York Times, the Atlantic, and countless articles and blog posts &amp;mdash; both adulating and irritated &amp;mdash; across the internet.</description>

      <description>Artyom Trakhanov, where have you been all my life? Trakhanov is the artist for a new miniseries from Boom! called Turncoat, and his art is unlike just about anyone working in the American comics business today. Trakhanovâs art is along the lines of European comics artists, (which makes sense, since heâs Russian) meaning itâs obsessively detailed, focused on different kinds of panel-to-panel transitions than American counterparts, and packed full of interesting, unique characters.</description>

      <description>Tonight is the monthly meeting for SCBWI of Western Washington (Society of Children&amp;rsquo;s Book Writers and Illustrators), and the topic is diversity. Anybody who follows the children&amp;rsquo;s market knows that diversity is a huge issue right now. From Marley Dias to George Washinton&amp;rsquo;s slaves, this is an important issue to explore in depth, especially from the point-of-view of creators. A great panel, including Philip Lee of Lee &amp;amp; Low Books, Kelly Jones, KCLS librarian Ann Crewdson, and Liz Wong, will be on hand to explore and offer suggestions.</description>

      <description>Last night, dozens of peopleÂ packed into the (drafty, noisy) side room at the Pine Box to celebrate the opening night of the APRIL Festival. They were rewarded with four readings about youth and old age, about coming-of-age celebrations and old traditions.
Portland novelist Sara Jaffe and APRIL writer-in-residence Jenny Zhang shared a youthful approach. Jaffe read a portion of her debut novel Dryland, about a 15-year-old girl in 1992. It opened with the protagonist conflating the Eric Clapton songs âWonderful Tonightâ and âTears in Heaven,â but most of the excerpt wasnât interested in a nostalgia trip, or 90s-night jokes.</description>

Claudia Castro Luna told KUOW last year that her primary goal as Seattleâs very first Civic Poet was to create âa poetry grid,â a cultural map of Seattle. Tonight, her grid expands to West Seattle with the help of Oscar de la Paz, a powerful poet who writes about murder and love and heartbreak. *C&amp;P Coffee Company, 5612 California Ave.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking of the item from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s Book News Roundup about Harper Lee&amp;rsquo;s estate pulling the plug on the mass market paperback edition of To Kill a Mockingbird. Mass market paperbacks, of course, aren&amp;rsquo;t nearly as profitable as hardcovers or trade paperbacks; that&amp;rsquo;s why you don&amp;rsquo;t see them so much anymore. If you can coax audiences into paying more than double for the same set of words, I guess the thinking goes, why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?</description>

      <description>Tonight is the first night of the APRIL Festival, the annual celebration of Authors, Publishers, and Readers of Independent Literature. Now through Sunday, APRIL will be putting on events around Capitol and First Hill. Most of those events are absolutely free. But I wanted to alert you to the two events that are ticketed: Thursday night&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;A Poet, a Playwright, a Novelist and a Drag Queen&amp;rdquo; competitive storytelling event and Friday night&amp;rsquo;s Five-Year Anniversary party.</description>

      <description>I need bread for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Sweet grain, salted grain, I want so much
To swallow you whole. I&amp;rsquo;m a damn sinner
Who can only be saved by your fingers.
Hurry, place the sacred bread on my tongue
And consecrate breakfast, lunch, and dinner &amp;mdash;
Or maybe not. I wish I were slimmer
And more disciplined &amp;mdash; a secular monk!
But I lust, lust and lust. I&amp;rsquo;m a sinner</description>

      <description>The Booker-winning author of novels including Hotel du Lac, Altered States, and The Rules of Engagement died at the age of 87. Brookner had the kind of career to which most novelists should aspire: long, productive, and meaningful. You could choose any one of her books at random and be assured that you&amp;rsquo;re about to read a stylistically powerful, satisfying novel. That&amp;rsquo;s the best kind of legacy.</description>

      <description>Seattle ice creamery Full Tilt debuts a Nancy Pearl-themed ice cream on April 10th, reports Seattle Metropolitan. What does Nancy Pearl ice cream taste like? It&amp;rsquo;s peanut butter with a fudge swirl.
 Harper Lee&amp;rsquo;s estate has reportedly killed the mass-market edition of To Kill a Mockingbird. This is going to make the book inaccessible for public schools around the country. What&amp;rsquo;s this mean? Alex Shephard at the New Republic writes:</description>

      <description>â¦Look, a cat killed a cardinal
on an emerald lawn.
For so many reasons it shouldnât have been beautiful. But thatâs also
the kind of book
I like best.  Looking, according to Lia Purpura, is always instructive. She describes what she finds, and how it registers in her body. Feelings that are complicated, hard to pin down, uncomfortable or confusing call her to deeper inquiry. Sheâs refined her practice through three collections of essays (Increase, Rough Likeness, and On Looking,) and three of poetry (The Brighter the Veil, Stone Sky Lifting, and King Baby).</description>

      <description>Audra Gallegos, school librarian at Lawton Elementary School, started out as a teacher. Whyâd she make the switch to librarian? Being a teacher âdidnât turn out to be literary enough,â she says. âWhen WASL became more important, the writing became more dry. It was less about experiencing the world through literature and more about writing essays.â
âIâd always wanted to be a librarian because Iâm such a reader,â Gallegos explains, so she took a two-year, part-time certificate program at University of Washington.</description>

Susan Orlean closed her talk at Hugo House by quoting something she said she&#39;d hope to someday turn into a bumper sticker. &#34;Writing is life. Approach your writing in the best way you can imagine approaching life. Ears open, eyes wide.&#34;
Kind of long for a bumper sticker, but not for a talk she delivered to a captivated crowd at Hugo House last night.</description>

      <description>A city is not just a black dot on a map. A city is not just its streets, or its buildings, or its people. When you take a long view, a city is a river in time. If you were to view the life of a city from its founding to its destruction in high speed, say a year passing every second, you would see it as a jittery flow of kinetic energy that wends and winds and shapes the earth around it.</description>

      <description>Donald Trump wants to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. It will be a beauty. He builds nice fences. Fences are easy. Will Donaldâs beautiful wall replace the billions of dollars of fencing that has already been erected along parts of the 1,933-mile border interspersed with a &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; fence of cameras and sensors? Or will it merely fill in the gaps, some of which experts have already determined to be hazardous to workers, environmentally devastating, or prohibitively expensive?</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago in her Help Desk column, Cienna Madrid responded to a question from Alyssa about tidying up the neighborhood Little Free Library. Today&#39;s Mail Bag is from an actual librarian. You can always read more of Cienna&#39;s columns on her archive page, and reach out to us if you&#39;d like to comment on anything we publish.
 Dear Cienna &amp;mdash; I greatly enjoy your column. Your advice to the person who wrote in about inappropriate stuff in the local Little Free Library and wanting to clean it out was right on, except for one aspect I disagree with: she should not tape a note to the LFL about her plans to clean it out.</description>

      <description>The first issue of novelist Chelsea Cainâs new Mockingbird series was published yesterday, and speaking on a strictly anecdotally basis the book seems to be garnering interest â late yesterday afternoon, Phoenix Comics was down to its last two copies. Which, considering this is a character who previously was best-known as a member of the West Coast Avengers, is some sort of a feat. The Mockingbird character âÂ a SHIELD spy named Bobbi Morse â has recently earned some new attention thanks to Adrianne Palickiâs portrayal of her in the TV show Marvelâs Agents of SHIELD.</description>

      <description>âThis is probably the best job in the world,â says Chris Gustafson, the school librarian at Whitman Middle School. âItâs so much fun, and what makes it so much fun is its biggest challenge.â Elementary school classes, she explains, are scheduled for librarian visits, while âno one has to come to the library in a middle school â itâs my job to make that happen,â to entice the students into visiting the library.</description>

      <guid>http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-adverbs-of-war/</guid>
      <description>The title of Seattle poet Don Mee Choiâs second book, Hardly War, is a curious combination of words that seems innocuous enough if youâre, say, skimming spines on a bookshelf. But if you give it two secondsâ thought, those two words, âhardlyâ and âwar,â obviously belong nowhere near each other. War is a binary; youâre either at war or youâre not. There are no small wars, or halfway wars, or hardly wars.</description>

      <description>We here at the Seattle Review of Books are very pleased to announce a new partnership: starting this week, youâll be able to find our reading calendar picks and selected book reviews in the print edition of the Seattle Weekly. Weâve noticed over the last year or so that the arts writing in the Weekly, under the guidance of editor-in-chief Mark Baumgarten and culture &amp;amp; commix editor Kelton Sears, has been getting better and better â new work from local cartoonists, the best music coverage in the city, and a focus on artists that no other media outlets in town are covering.</description>

      <description>Sad news: Jessa Crispin, founder of the popular book blog Bookslut, announced on Twitter that she&amp;rsquo;s shutting down the blog after 14 years. Bookslut was one of the very first book blogs I ever read, along with the late, lamented Bookninja, and it was hugely influential for me. (I sent a terrible pitch to them when I was just starting out and, thankfully, never received a response.) If you&amp;rsquo;ve never read Bookslut, I encourage you to go check it out; all the issues are archived, providing a kind of literary time capsule as far back as May of 2002.</description>

      <description>Seattle publisher Sasquatch Books was celebrated as one of seven fast-growing independent publishers of the year in Publishers Weekly.   As Seattle independent publisher Sasquatch Books enters 2016âits 30th yearâthe company points to breakout hits such asÂ *The 52 Lists Project*Â andÂ *A Boat, a Whale, and a Walrus*Â as keys to its recent success. Known for its list of nonfiction books, Northwest regional titles, and guidebook series, Sasquatch has branched out into a variety of subjects, including cooking, lifestyle, and childrenâs books.</description>

      <description>She squishes through fish, salmon stacked up to the door,
boots tracking scales in the wheelhouse, on the galley floor,
down the companionway, and in the engine room.
By the end of the day, there are scales on the mast. Scales
on the deck winch, on the ladder and steps. Scales in her hair,
in her gloves, up her sleeves, behind her ears. Scales
like freckles. Scales like glitter. Like bindis, like dragon skin.</description>

Once you get the practice down, most writers will tell you, writing is easy. It&amp;rsquo;s the revising that&amp;rsquo;s tough. When you understand that fact, it&amp;rsquo;s really kind of surprising that aspiring authors spend so much money on how-to-write classes, when it&amp;rsquo;s the revision classes that ought to be their focus.</description>

 The MFA in Creative Writing program at Whidbey Island&amp;rsquo;s Northwest Institute of Literary Arts is in serious financial trouble. Here&amp;rsquo;s a letter from a student outlining the problem â &amp;ldquo;We are devastated to learn that, in the middle of our semester, we have no idea if we will continue,&amp;rdquo; she writes âÂ and here&amp;rsquo;s where you can donate to help.</description>

      <description>Catherine&amp;rsquo;s Pascha, written by this week&amp;rsquo;s sponsor Charlotte Riggle and illustrated by R.J. Hughes, is about a girl&amp;rsquo;s determination to stay awake for Pascha. In the Orthodox Christian church, Easter services are held in the middle of the night. It&amp;rsquo;s a story of a girl&amp;rsquo;s coming of age in the culture of her family, and learning about tradition and faith.
Charlotte will be appearing March 11th at A Good Book Cafe in Sumner for a Kid&amp;rsquo;s Night in the Bookstore, for snacks, a reading, and a lights out tour of the store with flashlights.</description>

After all, the eruption of Mount St. Helens is recent enough â in geological terms, it&amp;rsquo;s barely been a matter of seconds â that we all understand what happens when a mountain decides to blow its metaphorical and literal top.</description>

 Emma was very pretty, describing herself as somewhat vain; she wore false hair to frame her face, loved fancy clothes, played cards, went to dances, and wrote of sharing a âbucket of beerâ with a friend in Seattle, as the two women commiserated about their errant husbands.</description>

      <description>In the beginning was the author. She wrote into a blank void, empty of human emotion, empty of human intention. There, she placed the character, who stood looking around and scratching herself occasionally.
The author gave the character a desire, and the character moved. She moved towards her yearning, and in her movement a path was created, spanning from the point she started all the way to the point that contained her desire.</description>

      <description>The romance novel industry, someone announces early in the new documentary Love Between the Covers, is both âa female industryâ and a âmulti-billion dollar industry.â Plenty of other genres âÂ sci-fi, horror, fantasy â are continually re-appraised by critics and celebrated for their literary worth, but romance novels have never received anything close to mainstream acceptance, even though romance novels, by any metric of popularity or commercial success, are the mainstream; one title card in Covers informs us that in the past year, â75 million Americans read at least one romance novel.</description>

*(Once in a while, I take a new book with me to lunch and give it a half an hour or so to grab my attention. **Lunch Date** is my judgment on that speed-dating experience.)* **Whoâs your date today?** *The Heart*, a novel by Maylis de Kerangal and translated by Sam Taylor.
**Whereâd you go?** I walked to Renton this weekend. I was very hungry when I got there, and I know very little about Renton, so I asked Twitter where I should go.</description>

      <description>For years, film nerds and comics nerds used to get in silly fights over which medium was better. Comics nerds would argue that you could do literally anything on a comics page, while budgets and the constraints of reality meant that movies had some natural restrictions on how far-out they could get. The dawning of CGI simultaneously imploded this argument and proved it correct; as soon as great computer special effects made it possible to put anything onscreen, superhero comics basically started dominating Hollywoodâs blockbuster space.</description>

      <description>The delightfully named Gabrielle Bluestone at Gawker reports that nine House Republicans voted against naming a post office after the late poet Maya Angelou. Then Bluestone turns the tables on them:  âI think people should investigate Maya Angelou a little bit, and Iâll suggest perhaps if you want to investigate a little bit further that perhaps you Google âMaya Angelouâ and look at other articles in places like the American Thinker or the American Spectator,â Rep.</description>

      <description>Itâs early in the year, time for taking on ambitious, resolution-worthy reading projects, and what better project than The Dying Grass, the latest novel from William T. Vollmann?
Vollmann, our young nationâs own Tolstoy.
Russia can keep Count Lev Nikolaevich and his high society, literary friends, peasant pedagogy, and pacifist moralism. Oh look, thereâs Leo dressing up as a muzhik again.
Here in the modern-day U.S.A., weâve got William Tanner Vollmann.</description>

(If you&amp;rsquo;ve never been, Open Books is one of a handful of poetry bookstores in the United States. And also, shame on you for living in Seattle and never going to Open Books.) Here it is, in its entirety:
Dear Friends of Open Books,
It is with mixed feelings that I tell you **I will retire from bookstore ownership sometime this year**.</description>

      <description>There once was an app called called Readmill. For a brief time, it was the best literature reading and social app. You stored and read books there, like a Kindle (although, only in the open ePub format). You could highlight sections in the book, and your friends could like, or comment on the quotes. You could sum up the book at the end. It was rather like a well-designed GoodReads mashed-up with a Kindle app that cared deeply about typography.</description>

      <description>Anyone with even a passing interest in books should take a moment to acknowledge the death last month of Elizabeth Eisenstein, the first person to draw our attention to the momentous impact that printing had on human civilization. Nowadays, panel after panel of historians rank the invention of printing as mankind&amp;rsquo;s most important invention since the wheel. But when Betty Eisenstein advanced that idea nearly thirty years ago, no one had thought of it before.</description>

      <description>On paper there is a woman and a heart. On
another, something is missing from a hand.
These are not metaphors. Weight becomes
a unit of measurement. Here. The point
of origin is here. Hands suspended
next to your skin is here. But that ends
here. Next to overturned boats and a drum
that can hold chemicals strong enough
to dissolve a body, but not dissolve itself.</description>

Because they&amp;rsquo;re hosting at least two book-centric events in this year&amp;rsquo;s Magma Fest. On March 13th, Sara Century is presenting a lecture on the history of LGBT characters in comics and Babel/Salvage is presenting the &amp;ldquo;Glossophonic Showcase&amp;rdquo; on March 25th, featuring readings from Kreg Hasegawa, Lauren Ireland, Sue Landers, and experimental musicians.</description>

      <description>Our sponsor Julie Manthey was camping at Cape Disappointment when she came up with the idea for her first novel, The Magic of Cape Disappointment. The history of Lewis &amp;amp; Clark permeats the Columbia River outlet, and there are so many things unknown in the accounts of their history.
One fictional spark: what if Meriwether Lewis had children? What would happen if one his descendents, Kay, returned home to care for family, and discovered strange coincidences, unique characters, and, of course, a man that bears a resemblence to a mysterious character Kay had been painting?</description>

      <description>When Amazon bought the book-themed social media site Goodreads in 2013, Goodreads users went through three stages in quick succession. First, they were outraged, publishing angry posts to Facebook about how betrayed they felt. They hated that Goodreads sold out to the evil empire, wondered if their Goodreads data would be accessible to Amazon shoppers, and tried half-heartedly to find an alternative literary social media site.
Second, they mourned. They talked about how theyâd never be able to trust Goodreads again, and wondered if everything they ever loved would eventually be absorbed into the Amazon mothership.</description>

      <description>The New Web Typography Surely, you can picture them: the Penguin books with the colored covers, the little medalian at the bottom with the line-drawing of the bird logo? That design and layout are the work of the great typographer and designer Jan Tschichold. His most famous book, The New Typography, was a firebrand call from a young designer &amp;mdash; one who later came to disown some of the more radical ideas he earlier held (I wrote about Tschichold, and how he got in trouble with the Nazis, and his relationship with Penguin in this essay).</description>

      <title>Wide World Books launches crowdfunding campaign</title>

      <description>On the same weekend that Seattle Mystery Bookshop&amp;rsquo;s GoFundMe campaign draws to a close, Wallingford&amp;rsquo;s delightful Wide World Travel &amp;amp; Maps â the oldest travel bookstore in the country âÂ has launched their own GoFundMe campaign. They&amp;rsquo;re looking to raise $30,000, and according to Shelf Awareness, Rick Steves&amp;rsquo; Europe has donated a compelling travel package if the store hits its goals.
As I said when Seattle Mystery Bookshop announced their campaign, if crowd-funding isnât your thing but you like to support independent bookstores, stop by Wide World Travel &amp;amp; Maps â theyâre at 4411 Wallingford Ave N â and pick up a few books to prepare for an upcoming vacation, or a trip that you hope to one day make.</description>

      <description>In 2008, the Seattle International Film Festival hosted the film Battle in Seattle as its opening night gala presentation. Battle, a fictionalized account of the 1999 World Trade Organization protests, had the pedigree of a successful film: it starred Charlize Theron, Outkastâs Andre 3000, Woody Harrelson, Ray Liotta, and Channing Tatum, and it was scored by Massive Attack. At the opening night screening, the room clearly wanted to be on the film&amp;rsquo;s side; Seattle desperately loves to see itself legitimized through adaptation, even if nine times out of ten itâs portrayed onscreen by Vancouver.</description>

      <description>If you only read one group piece about a particular aspect of the publishing industry today&amp;hellip;well, you should read the piece about the whiteness of the publishing industry that I linked to earlier today. But if you have time to read two group pieces about a particular aspect of the publishing industry today, you should definitely read this BookRiot interview with 12 translators about why they love translation.</description>

      <description>Two more to go. The 18th issue of Intruder, Seattleâs free, invitation-only comics anthology, is available around town right now, which means only issues 19 and 20 are left before the whole operation folds. Everything seems more acute when a countdown timerâs running, of course, so itâs hard to say for sure, but this issue of Intruder certainly feels moreâ¦Intruder-ier than ever before: thicker, full of a wider variety of comics, even livelier than usual.</description>

      <description>For Duane Wilkins, University Book Store is a family affair. His mother worked there for over 20 years, and he started shopping there, by his own estimation, somewhere between the ages of 12 and 14. âI think sometimes I work here as karmic payback for what I put booksellers throughâ as a customer, Wilkins jokes. He used to bombard U Book Store employees with questions âÂ âwhen is the next book in this series coming out and when is this book coming out in paperbackâ and so on.</description>

      <description>Stesha Brandon has long been one of the most passionate advocates for literary events in Seattle, first in her role as events coordinator at University Book Store and then as program director at Town Hall Seattle. [Todayâs announcement that she is the new interim executive director](http://seattlecityoflit.org/blog/) of [Seattleâs City of Literature organization](http://seattlecityoflit.org/) is great news. Brandon brings to the job a steady hand, a proven commitment to the community, and a keen sense of what Seattleâs literary scene needs, as well as a much-needed critical eye and a sterling record of professionalism.</description>

      <description>Eva Jurczyk writes at The Awl:
...what if I, in my capacity as a book reviewer, have the power to shift the ratio of rubbish pirate books by dudes to meaningful literature by women? The publishing houses will keep putting out books about buccaneers and theyâll keep appearing on my monthly review list but what if I donât expend any mental energy or spill a drop of ink about them? This wouldnât change the number of books by women that are published every year, nor the total number of books that *Publisherâs Weekly* reviewsâsome eight thousand per year, mostly for librarians, the media, and booksellersâbut if someone is reserving all of their mental energy and all of their ink for female-authored books, then perhaps these books will be covered sooner, the gems among them celebrated louder, and the publishing industry will slowly adjust the definition of the type of book that is deemed worthy of attention.</description>

      <description>Congratulations are due to Chris Higashi, the director of the Washington Center for the Book. Mary Ann Gwinn at the Seattle Times reports that Higashi is receiving this year&amp;rsquo;s Sherry Prowda Literary Champion Award, which is a prize celebrating a person who champions the Seattle literary community. Higashi is a powerhouse who curates the library&amp;rsquo;s reading series and many of the library&amp;rsquo;s wonderful literacy programs. She is exactly the kind of person the library should be emulating; let&amp;rsquo;s hope this award underlines that fact.</description>

so close and looking at something

      <description>You probably havenât read The Scarlet Letter since you were in high school. Thatâs understandable. Most people recall The Scarlet Letter as an arduous reading experience. This is because The Scarlet Letter is not a book that should be given to teenagers. Its themes â of responsibility to the community, of the simultaneous importance and uselessness of personal reputation, of id and ego â are way too sincere and nuanced for any hormone-addled teenager to understand.</description>

      <description>MONDAY Elliott Bay Book Company kicks off your Week in Readings. Mo Daviau reads from her debut novel, which is titled Every Anxious Wave. Kirkus described it as a âpunk-rock-time-travel story for the ages.â Itâs about a person who finds a time-warp in his closet, which he then leases out to people so they can go back in time and watch their favorite bands play.

      <description>[The Secret Lives of Tumblr Teens](https://newrepublic.com/article/129002/secret-lives-tumblr-teens &#34;The Secret Lives of Tumblr Teens | New Republic&#34;) The extraordinarily nutso piece by Elspeth Reeve that everybody was talking about this week.
 Each social media network creates a particular kind of teenage star: Those blessed with early-onset hotness are drawn to YouTube, the fashionable and seemingly wealthy post to Instagram, the most charismatic actors, dancers, and comedians thrive on Vine. On Facebook, every link you share and photo you post is a statement of your identity.</description>

      <description>Italian news sources are reporting that author Umberto Eco has passed away. He turned 84 years old last month. Eco is the author of two global bestsellers: Foucault&amp;rsquo;s Pendulum, a playful conspiracy thriller; and The Name of the Rose, a murder mystery set in a Benedictine monastery. I especially enjoyed Eco&amp;rsquo;s underrated 2004 novel The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, a deeply personal tribute to the comics and pulp literature of Eco&amp;rsquo;s youth, as well as a rumination on memory and aging.</description>

      <description>Alex Balk at The Awl published a brief post against longform nonfiction storytelling. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote from the piece, which I think gets the point across with even more brevity: &amp;ldquo;Are there some stories so intricate that they actually demand tens of thousands of words to tell them? Sure. Maybe six or seven a year. Everything else you read is padding or awards-bait.&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s purposefully incendiary stuff, and obviously a broad generalization.</description>

      <description>The author of To Kill a Mockingbird â and, so far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned, the author of only To Kill a Mockingbird â has died at age 89.
Those who believe the Great American Novel is a singular experience have it wrong; there are many Great American Novels, each a timeless snapshot of a particular moment in American history. Of that tradition of Great American Novels, To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the very best, because it delivered the America that we all â Northern or Southern, black or white, woman or man â aspire to create.</description>

Christine Marie Larsen is off for the next few weeks, no doubt hand-assembling brushes from rarified animal hairs, gathering pigment from the mineraled rocks atop the highest peaks, and making paper from the miraculous cotton rags used to clean the paintings of the old masters in the Louvre.
In her absence, you can always see her work in our archive of the Portrait Gallery. She&amp;rsquo;ll see you all in a few weeks.</description>

      <title>Talking with Matt Ruff about science fiction&#39;s racist past</title>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1455811733856/IMG_4432.JPG)
Seattle author Matt Ruffâs new novel [*Lovecraft Country*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/caught-after-dark-in-lovecraft-country/) is a thoughtful, rewarding examination of the connection between genre and American racism. Specifically, itâs a story that juxtaposes Americaâs shameful history of systemic racism with the racist history of American science fiction. While the former is well-documented, sci-fiâs racist past is much less overt.
The pivot-point for the novel is arguably the most famous racist in American literary history: HP Lovecraft, the cult horror writer who was an unabashed white supremacist.</description>

      <description>If you were to ask me to nominate one cartoonist to create a comic book adaptation of a Todd Solondz film, I would, without a second thought, choose Nick Drnaso. Like Solondz&amp;rsquo;s films, the world in Drnasoâs new collection Beverly is ugly and mundane; unattractive Americans live their boring lives in bland surroundings â cut-rate hotel rooms, tract housing. Drnaso draws his figures with simple lines, often at the middle distance.</description>

      <description>We here at the Seattle Review of Books are incredibly excited for Link Light Rail to open to Capitol Hill and the University District. (Fun fact: light rail opens on the exact same weekend as the APRIL Festival&amp;rsquo;s big book fair at the Hugo House! That&amp;rsquo;s your Sunday, March 20th all sorted for you.) And this video from Sound Transit profiling Seattle cartoonist Ellen Forney is only getting us more excited about launch-day, especially because it&amp;rsquo;s got plenty of footage of the installation of Forney&amp;rsquo;s beautiful illustrations of giant hands in the Capitol Hill station.</description>

      <description>The thing you realize within a few seconds of talking to University Book Storeâs Caitlin is that she reads a lot. Like, a lot. She estimates she plows through about five books a week, on average. âI read fast,â she admits. âPartly because when I was in college, I would do theater, and I would also have to read James Fenimore Cooper or *Moby Dick*â for class assignments. Every time I see Caitlin, sheâs gushing about some book that just came out, or that is about to come out, or that will be out in a month or two.</description>

 Capitol Hill Seattle Blog has the skinny on V2, the new temporary arts space in the old Value Village building on Capitol Hill&amp;rsquo;s 11th Ave. Literary tenants include Bumbershoot producer One Reel and possibly Hugo House, and the space will be broken up into &amp;ldquo;performance areas, rental studios, classrooms, offices, and storage.</description>

      <description>Two Sylvias Press&amp;rsquo;s annual chapbook contest is now open for submissions. The reading fee is $15, but the payoff is pretty great: the winner gets $400 and 20 copies of their finished chapbook. A poem by the winner of 2014&amp;rsquo;s chapbook contest, Cecilia Woloch, was recently featured in the New York Times Magazine.
 We&amp;rsquo;ve already suggested two great events for tonight, but we just learned about this event happening in the Husky Union Building on the UW campus tonight, and we wanted you to know about it: an evening of Arabic Poetry and Music, featuring poetry read in English and in Arabic by students.</description>

      <description>In his introduction to the Hugo Houseâs Lit Series event on Friday night, event programmer Peter Mountford called âwhat goes around comes aroundâ the âimmaculate conception of clichÃ©s.â Most clichÃ©s, he said, have very clear, recognizable origins, but âwhat goes around comes aroundâ has existed for as long as language has existed, and it canât be broken down into any simpler parts. Itâs one of the clearest, simplest concepts that exists in written language.</description>

      <description>Our thanks to Sagging Meniscus Press for sponsoring the site this week with a truly unique, and remarkable, book: The Too-Brief Chronicle of Judah Lowe, by Christopher Carter Sanderson. On our sponsors page we have three excerpts: from the introduction, which sets the stage, and from each of the two sections of the book, each told through the lens of severe restriction. All art comes from the artist creating rules and restrictions &amp;mdash; some of them mundane, such as the choice of paint or the size of canvas, some of them severe (those of you who saw the brilliant film The Five Obstructions will know what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about).</description>

      <description>Matt Ruff had me a few pages into his new novel, Lovecraft Country, where one of its black characters ponders my own great childhood shame this way: âTom Swift &amp;hellip; which Earl had loved when he was young â¦ embarrassed him now, both for the booksâ depiction of Negroes and for the fact that as a boy he hadnât noticed it &amp;hellip;.â Because Ruffâs book has the mid-1950s as its setting, Earl almost certainly refers to the original series of Swift novels, which predate WWI and even have a white character use the expression ânigger in the woodpile.</description>

 When he was 11, Samuel R. Delany stayed overnight at a Harlem hospital for observation. It was 1953, and nearly a decade before Delany would publish his first science-fiction novel. He had already realized he was gay. With trepidation, he asked the doctor, a white man, how many gays existed in America. The doctor laughed.</description>

      <description>Cienna Madrid is celebrating the long Presidents&amp;rsquo; Day weekend by not offering any advice at all. Never fear: she&amp;rsquo;ll be back next week with an all-new column. If you&amp;rsquo;re desperately in need of a Cienna fix, may we humbly suggest you investigate the Help Desk archives? That&amp;rsquo;s 25 weeks packed full of literary advice!</description>

      <title>Book News Roundup: The huge success of #1000BlackGirlsBooks</title>

      <description>We told you a couple weeks ago about Marley Dias, the student who, &amp;ldquo;sick of reading about white boys and dogs,&amp;rdquo; launched the #1000BlackGirlsBooks hashtag. Now, according to Vox, Dias&amp;rsquo;s mission is complete: She has collected 1000 books featuring black girls as main characters, and is donating them to libraries in her school and to an elementary school in Jamaica. Here is Dias on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, discussing her project:    Here is a sentence that is full of awesome: Shoreline Community college students, inspired by a social-justice-themed science fiction anthology, are hosting a book drive benefitting Books to Prisoners.</description>

      <title>Get ready for Hometown Heroes</title>

      <description>So this is a big deal: Hometown Heroes is a one-day, free, all-ages comics art show &amp;ldquo;formed out of a desire to connect creators, readers, and the stories that bond them in a new way.&amp;rdquo; It happens on April 8th from 6 to 11 pm at 1927 Events (1927 3rd Ave). I love Emerald City Comicon as much as anyone, but you can&amp;rsquo;t really argue that ECCC gives as much attention to Seattle comics creators as it used to; the show has become a very big, very mainstream event.</description>

Judy Blume is certainly somebody we don&amp;rsquo;t need to say very much about, other than tomorrow is her birthday. Millions of kids learned about themselves, and their friends, neighbors, and siblings through her empathetic and big-hearted works. If she were here, we&amp;rsquo;d say thank you Judy Blume!</description>

      <description>Mary Ann Gwinn at the Seattle Times offers an in-depth preview of Third Place Books&amp;rsquo; new Seward Park store, which will open in late April.
 Seattle author Lesley Hazleton&amp;rsquo;s upcoming book on agnosticism, Agnostic: A Spirited Manifesto, has earned two places of pride in the most recent issue of Publishers Weekly. Hazleton&amp;rsquo;s book received a starred review praising &amp;ldquo;her appealing voice and accessible prose,&amp;rdquo; and it was also chosen as a most-anticipated book of the spring.</description>

      <description>Some of the best comics-minded thinkers â Grant Morrison, Kieron Gillen, Kelly Sue DeConnick â love to talk about comic books in musical metaphors. Itâs an apt comparison; sometimes going to the comic book store and picking up a few comics is reminiscent of visiting the record store and walking out with a bag full of singles. Theyâre tiny bursts of art in an eminently consumable, commercial format, and they have their own aura of cool about them.</description>

      <description>This is not a drill:
The eighth installment of the Harry Potter series, the two-part play, &#34;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,&#34; will be published as a book this summer, author J.K Rowling announced on her Pottermore website Wednesday. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will be released on July 31st, which is canonically Harry Potter&amp;rsquo;s birthday. Presumably, it will break all previous sales records for plays.</description>

      <description>Congratulations to Sherman Alexie, who is this year&amp;rsquo;s Pierce County Library system selection for Pierce County Reads. The library chose five of Alexie&amp;rsquo;s books for everyone in Pierce County to read. They are: The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven, Reservation Blues, Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, Flight, and War Dances. I wholeheartedly agree; everyone in Washington state should read all of those books.
 Seattle Arts and Lectures is hiring a Program Associate for its Writers in the Schools program.</description>

      <description>I love Simon Joynerâs music already â I donât listen to it all the time, or even every year, though I always come back â but I was unsure about this collection. Lyrics are not, I think, âpoems without their clothing,â as Dennis Callaci writes in his introduction to Only Love Can Bring You Peace, Joyner&amp;rsquo;s first book. Dudes: poems are not naked songs. Not everything is purer, more vulnerable when stripped.</description>

      <description>Brad Craft, the used book buyer at University Book Store, says he âdidnât grow up in a bookish atmosphereâ â he didnât have access to a good library, and none of his teachers introduced him to the joys of literature. Where did he learn to love books? âYard sales,â he says. He was especially drawn to a certain type of book: âIâve read more gothic romance novels than most men my age,â Craft explains.</description>

      <description>The rule of thumb about questions in headlines â that most headline questions can be answered, simply, &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; â has never been more true than in this blog post, which is headlined &amp;ldquo;Are Paid Book Reviews Worth It?&amp;rdquo;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that paid book reviews existed, but now I&amp;rsquo;m horrified to learn that they do. Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: if you&amp;rsquo;re paying for a review, the likely audience of that review is just going to be a bunch of authors who have also paid for reviews.</description>

Eve of the new year. Bitter cold city. I sit by the cafÃ© window, bring the soup bowl to my lips. Someone in the park across the street is swinging high on a swing-set in the dark. 344.
At least one keyhole has been stuffed with tissue by a previous tenant. So there is no seeing through. 345.
A very partial morning. The things I am trying constantly to re-make, alter, edit, adjust.</description>

      <description>Remember the &amp;ldquo;If All Seattle Read the Same Book&amp;rdquo; program that Nancy Pearl started almost twenty years ago? Did you know it&amp;rsquo;s still going on? It&amp;rsquo;s true! Only a few years ago, Seattle Public Library changed the title of the program from Nancy Pearl&amp;rsquo;s super-cool name to the much-less-compelling &amp;ldquo;Seattle Reads.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s still basically the same idea: SPL has a ton of copies of one book, and the author appears at library branches all around town to talk about the book.</description>

That means it&amp;rsquo;s time to read the book before the film arrives into the world. Read the entire first chapter on ours sponsors page. Also, check out Kelley&amp;rsquo;s writing about what it was like to write this film based on her book.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, take a look at our open dates.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s gauche, I know, for a reviewer to ask a favor of his readers. In 2016, a book critic should be happy to be read at all. But Iâm going to ask something of you, regardless â and hopefully youâll get something out of this, too, besides the glow of internal warmth that comes from knowing that you indulged the whims of a tired old book reviewer. My request is this: print this review out.</description>

This is a new fortune-telling themed reading series from the Hugo House, and itâs got a great gimmick: audience members anonymously ask questions about their futures. The authors find answers to those questions in their books. Hugo House supplied a sample Q&amp;amp;A in the promotional materials:

 &#34;The great tradition of black art, generally,&#34; he started again, &#34;is the ability â unlike American art in general â to tell the truth. Because it was formed around the great American poison, the thing that poisoned American consciousness and behavior: racism.</description>

      <description>The headline of this post is the motto of Editions at Play, a new digital bookstore teamup between London publisher Visual Editions and Google. According to Emiko Jozuka at Motherboard, the digital books are crosses between books, movies, and video games.
âWe wanted to think about what we could do online that we couldnât do in print. How could we make books that still feel bookishâso they are books that you would readâ but that you could experience as well given they are visual,â Anna Gerber, the co-creative director for Editions at Play, told me over the phone.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s definitely worth a lunchtime investigation.</description>

Help! My boyfriend and I are both serious readers. We spend most of our nights in working through our piles of books. We even got rid of our TV.</description>

      <description>Liam O&amp;rsquo;Brien at Melville House looks at Texas booksellers who are trying to come to terms with the state&amp;rsquo;s new open carry law. Many bookstores are banning guns:
I have always believed that bookstores are forums for all ideas, but I also understand that the free exchange of those ideas can be hindered (if not entirely obstructed) when one party in the conversation holds a deadly weapon. And one enterprising bookseller is actively encouraging guns:</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s a painting of Seattle&amp;rsquo;s own beloved son Ivar Haglund. Folk singer, restauranteur, accidental port commissioner, trouble-maker, inveterate punner (he&amp;rsquo;s listed as the &amp;ldquo;flounder&amp;rdquo; of his seafood restaurant, Ivar&amp;rsquo;s), and of mixed Scandehoovian lineage (his mother was Norwegian and his father was Swedish, nearly a Capulet/Montague situation).</description>

      <description>Last year, cartoonist Ted Rall visited Seattle with Snowden, a comic book biography of Edward Snowden. (I reviewed Snowden and interviewed Rall onstage at Town Hall.) Only a half-year later, Rallâs back, and reading at Town Hall tonight from his brand-new Bernie Sanders biography, Bernie.
Bernie and Snowden share many qualities. Rall makes them easy to read for comics newbies, pretty much drawing a single panel per page. Theyâre both openly advocating for their subjects â if youâre looking for objectivity, you shouldnât be picking up a book by Rall in the first place â and they both provide plenty of context to establish the central figures within their time.</description>

      <description>After yesterday&amp;rsquo;s gossip that Amazon is considering opening hundreds of Amazon Books locations nationwide in the next few years, Shelf Awareness, the industry news site which first broke the Amazon Books story, now says Amazon&amp;rsquo;s plans are more modest, likely in the range of a dozen or so stores. We at the Seattle Review of Books have heard that, too, from people in the industry. Amazon, of course, could do away with these rumors immediately, but Amazon doesn&amp;rsquo;t comment on stories like these.</description>

*While the City Slept* will almost certainly be one of the best books I&#39;ll read this year. But I worked with its author, Eli Sanders, for almost ten years at *The Stranger*, and so there&#39;s too much of a conflict of interest for me to review it. (We [published Martin McClellan&#39;s great review of the book yesterday](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/uncommitted/); you should read it.) Instead, I met with Eli on Saturday, January 23rd for an interview about the process of writing *While the City Slept*, the structure of the book, the benefits of taking your time to tell a story, and what Seattleites can do to fix our broken mental health care system.</description>

      <description>Quick: whatâs the oldest bookstore in Seattle? Generally when you ask a Seattleite that question, they break into a blank stare for a moment and then respond, âuh, Elliott Bay?â But no. Elliott Bay Book Company turns an impressive 43 years old this year. But our February bookstore of the month, University Book Store, celebrated its 116th birthday last month. 116 years! Youâd be hard-pressed to find anything in Seattle that old.</description>

      <title>Amazon to open hundreds of bookstores nationwide?</title>

      <guid>http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/amazon-to-open-hundreds-of-bookstores-nationwide/</guid>
      <description>The Wall Street Journal&amp;rsquo;s Greg Bensinger quotes Sandeep Mathrani, a chief executive of a company that owns malls nationwide, as saying that Amazon could be opening as many as 400 brick-and-mortar stores in the US. It&amp;rsquo;s just a rumor at this point, but it makes sense.
This, of course, is bad news for booksellers everywhere. University Book Store&amp;rsquo;s manager Pam Cady recently admitted that the new Amazon Books in University Village has eaten into her store&amp;rsquo;s profits, and other booksellers have expressed concern about Amazon Books opening near them.</description>

      <description>In 1860, Mrs. Elizabeth Packard had a conversation with a traveling sewing machine salesman. Her husband, a Calvinist minister named Theophilus Packard, was on her mind. Elizabeth had recently caused quite a ruckus when she stood up in the middle of one of her husband&amp;rsquo;s sermons, and announced that she was crossing the street to the Presbyterian church, whose religious views aligned better with hers.
&amp;ldquo;She found fault that Mr. Packard would not discuss their points of difference in religion in an open manly way instead of going around and denouncing her as crazy to her friends and to the church,&amp;rdquo; the salesman later testified.</description>

      <description>Suppose it is February and there are writers writing at picnic tables in the park. Suppose writing leads us to this park. Suppose the rhythm of the afternoon sky courses through you, igniting relief and terror. Suppose you are hungry and light-headed while hoping to retrieve the faintest mark.
Suppose a writer has planted a score inside her mouth. Suppose the wind morphs that score into something fizzy and warm. Suppose everyone puts pens down at the same time.</description>

      <description>The wonderful Entre RÃ­os Books is back as a sponsor, with their stunning book Twelve Saints. The work combines poems about twelve saints with collages built from tintype photographs. The effect is somehow both ethereal and concrete, and aesthetically it is absolutely gorgeous. We have a sample spread on our sponsor&amp;rsquo;s page. The book is reasonably priced, for such a beautiful work, and available at many locations in town, as well as on the Entre RÃ­os website.</description>

      <description>This weekend, G. Willow Wilson took a public stand against Marvel president Ike Perlmutter for donating $1 million to Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s weird pro-veteran charity thing. In her post on the controversy, Wilson made a joke about getting fired.
The next day, Wilson picked up an honor that definitely makes the case for her continued employment. Her Ms. Marvel comic won the Best Series award at the Angouleme International Comics Festival. It&amp;rsquo;s the first Marvel comic to ever win the award.</description>

Works in Progress has been going on for years now, and it will undoubtedly stick with Hugo House in their temporary location on First Hill, but there is a certain kind of magic to the Hugo House cabaret space right now, as awkward as it can be when thereâs a full house.</description>

      <description>[Maximum Wage: Is technological progress dependent on extreme inequality?](https://howwegettonext.com/maximum-wage-3e21048fc107#.l42rwltna) I&amp;rsquo;ve read many responses to Paul Graham&amp;rsquo;s overly simple Economic Inequality essay. The best, I think, is this by Steven Johnson. Not only is he of tech culture, but he&amp;rsquo;s willing to call out the things that are bad, as well as good. And he has an eye on a great truth of SF culture: it&amp;rsquo;s not all money-grubbing venture capital bros.</description>

      <description>Earlier today, the comics world responded to the news that Marvel president Ike Perlmutter donated one million dollars to Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s veteran event. Of course, if this were a simple donation to a nonprofit veteran association it would be a nonstory, but the fact that Perlmutter donated it to Trump&amp;rsquo;s event made the donation much more morally sticky. The money did not go, as Trump claimed, directly to veteran&amp;rsquo;s needs; it was donated to &amp;ldquo;The Donald Trump Foundation.</description>

      <description>Each week, [Christine Marie Larsen](http://christinelarsen.com) creates a portrait of a new author for us. Have any favorites youâd love to see immortalized? [Let us know](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about)

A subject who needs no introduction, and whose name is widely known. Nichols, of course, played Nyota Uhura in the original Star Trek series and movies. She was going to leave the role after the first season, but at a NAACP fundraiser, she met fan of the show who convinced her to stay on:</description>

      <description>If you hold a copy of Tom Hartâs new graphic novel Rosalie Lightning away from you by the spine, here is what youâll see:
![](/webhook-uploads/1453965563321/RosalieLightning.jpg)
The pages are stratified in asymmetrical bands of black and white â thick stretches of white broken up by occasional, quick bursts of black, with one dense stand of black pages. You see this kind of striation in black-and-white comics collections all the time, but in Rosalie Lightning, it looks more portentous.</description>

      <description>Local cartoonist Elk Paauwâs minicomic Itâs Okay to Be Sad Sometimes is a collection of short comics about sadness. Are all the sadnesses linked to a single cause? Maybe; itâs not entirely clear, though Paauw does allude to a breakup several times. In any case, the book works as a narrative about a single depression or as a thematic collection.
In the first couple pages, Paauw draws themself crying on a train; Paauwâs eyes are big, doe-y bubbles with leaking reservoirs of tears just underneath.</description>

      <description>In The Argonauts, Maggie Nelson seeks to clear things up by muddling them, by sweeping a careful hand through our delicate Manichean constructs of whatâs gay, trans, queer, female, and more. In a mixture of memoir and critical meditation, Nelson recounts her relationship with her partner Harry Dodge, her efforts to become pregnant, and the birth of her son, Iggy, using the quotidian tools of family-building to pick apart our words and notions.</description>

      <description>If you browse the comics section at Push/Pull, you might find a Post-It note affixed to the front of a minicomic here or there. These are the local equivalent of staff recommendation tags, only all the Post-Its are written by owner Maxx Follisâs son, and they are completely adorable. One Post-It on a book called The Age reads âIt has amazing twist. âSean.â A recommendation stuck to another book, I Think Our Friend Dan Might Be a Dolphin, by James Stanton, says âFunniest commic of 2015 â Sean, 8.</description>

      <description>I first encountered this tweet while I was reading Johanna Sinisalo&amp;rsquo;s wonderful The Core of the Sun:
Has anyone ever opened a novel and said &amp;quot;Oh good, a long passage in italics&amp;quot;
&amp;mdash; Elisa Gabbert (@egabbert) January 1, 2016 And while I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve never opened up a novel and been excited about the presence of italics, I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly never been disappointed to see italics, either. The Core of the Sun features quite a few passages in italics âÂ the book is made up of a collage of letters and dictionary entries and other odds and endsÂ âÂ and it works really well; the italics signify difference in a visual shorthand that&amp;rsquo;s not quite as jarring as, say, switching to a different font.</description>

      <description>Maire M. Masco, publisher of Seattle&amp;rsquo;s 1981 punk rock newspaper Desperate Times, had to consult her own copy to define âdonut-holerâ &amp;mdash; an epithet from the first issue and a few more down the line. Masco for the record:
âAt 1st and Pike, the entrance to the Pike Place Market, was a notorious donut shop. The place was open 24 hours a day and particularly after dark, was full of drunks, derelicts and street people.</description>

without words, on the desk, which was like a pasture, leaving me free to think.
I could not repair my cursive with my pen or with my breath on the window pane. The inkwells were filled from a large bottle of ink kept in the teacherâs closet.
My mother was disgusted by the inkwells, and by how I was forbidden to write</description>

      <description>Ron Charles at the Washington Post writes that Scholastic&amp;rsquo;s decision to recall their children&amp;rsquo;s book A Birthday Cake for George Washington is being protested by the National Coalition Against Censorship. (If you need a primer on the swirl around Birthday Cake, you should read Lisa Gold&amp;rsquo;s excellent review, which we ran last week.)
âThere are books that can â and should â generate controversy,â the organization said. âBut those who value free speech as an essential human right and a necessary precondition for social change should be alarmed whenever books are removed from circulation because they are controversial.</description>

Head to Town Hall Seattle for Oliver Morton, reading from his new book, The Planet Remade: How Geoengineering Could Change the World. Itâs about how âan increasing number of climate scientists are advocating for more proactive human intervention in the biosphere,â which can mean anything âfrom cultivating photosynthetic plankton to seeding clouds with fleets of unmanned ships.</description>

 In January 2011, days after the first uprising in Tunisia and the protests in Tahrir Square, the Guardian invited leading writers from across the Arab world to reflect on the revolutionary fervour sweeping the region. Then, they expressed great optimism for the future.</description>

 The Seattle Weekly&amp;rsquo;s Mark Baumgarten talks with David Brewster about his Seattle atheneum, Folio. I wrote about Folio last fall, and it&amp;rsquo;s now open to the public. If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering whether a paid library/coworking space is right for you, you should drop by and take a look. It&amp;rsquo;s on Marion Street, between 3rd Ave and 4th Ave downtown.

University Book Store manager Pam Cady is quoted extensively in a piece by Julia Carrie Wong in the Guardian today. Cady says Amazon&amp;rsquo;s brick-and-mortar store is having a serious effect on U Book Store&amp;rsquo;s sales:
âEveryoneâs had to adjust to Amazon online,â she says, âbut having a store just down the street is a little different. Weâre at ground zero. Weâre in the blast.â University Book Store is less than a mile away from Amazon Books.</description>

      <description>We live in a dystopian future in which the publishing industry puts out way too many works of dystopian fiction. The shelves of bookstores â young adult sections most especially â are packed to bursting with futures in which teenagers are forced to do battle for the amusement of the wealthy one percent, or in which a grizzled band of people who have seen too many bad things are trying to make their way to the mythical land of California, or in which Donald Trump is on the verge of winning the Republican presidential nomination.</description>

      <description>Recently, I visited a comic book store with a friend. She reads all kinds of graphic novels and collected comics, but sheâd never spent more than a few minutes in a comic shop. Immediately, it became clear that for people who havenât spent their whole lives in comic shops, thereâs a bit of a learning curve to browsing. She picked up a comic and turned it over, looking for an explanatory blurb, like the one you find on collected comics.</description>

      <description>No? I don&amp;rsquo;t either, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay. Joanna Rothkopf at Jezebel has written a great look back at 1991, when one of our greatest living poets decided to run for president as the only &amp;ldquo;openly female&amp;rdquo; candidate. This story is great for two reasons: First, it&amp;rsquo;s a great story. And second, it caused me to fall down an Eileen Myles-themed YouTube hole.

      <description>Deadline reports that Richard Morgan&amp;rsquo;s sci-fi novel Altered Carbon is on track to become a Netflix series.
Altered Carbon is a cyberpunk detective thriller in the style of William Gibson about digital immortality in a world 500 years from now. It&amp;rsquo;s a spectacular, fun novel and you should give it a try. Adaptations are a fine thing â Netflix has a pretty good track record when it comes to their programming â but a year from now, when everybody is talking about Altered Carbon, you&amp;rsquo;re going to want to read the original.</description>

Maxx Follis originally created the space that would become Push/Pull at Echo Echo, a collective gallery in Greenwood. She always intended for Push/Pull to be a cooperative space with artists acting as members, but her first call for members only delivered one artist â cartoonist Seth Goodkind. âSo when it started out it was just the two of us trying to fill four walls of artâ every month or so for a new show, she explains.</description>

      <description>According to ThinkProgress, Ursula K. Le Guin wrote an angry letter to the Oregonian in response to what she perceived as a pro-militia front page article.
Ammon Bundy and his bullyboys arenât trying to free federal lands, but to hold them hostage. I canât go to the Malheur refuge now, though as a citizen of the United States, I own it and have the freedom of it. Thatâs what public land is: land that belongs to the public â me, you, every law-abiding American.</description>

      <description>disturbed bodies
(ours)
and on the other side
a moon
possibly&amp;hellip;
watching
 switching pens there
subtle hope
&amp;amp; your tired body
tired
breathing hard&amp;hellip;
to exist
 My minor violence
Toward the gazelle
Is unforgivable
Now making lists
Of the longing that will stay&amp;hellip;
And the longing that
Will be fixed in images
Hatred splits us
But its necessity
Is like water
And love</description>

      <description>A sudden flurry of outraged tweets and blog posts last week led me to A Birthday Cake for George Washington, written by Ramin Ganeshram and illustrated by Vanessa Brantley-Newton, which the publisher touted as âbased on real events.â Set in 1790s Philadelphia, where George Washington was serving as Americaâs first president, the story is about Hercules, Washingtonâs slave-cook, and is narrated by his young daughter Delia.
Last night, less than two weeks after releasing the book (and only hours after I read it), Scholastic withdrew it and released this statement:</description>

      <description>Dalya Alberge writes at The Guardian that a recently uncovered manuscript co-authored by Orson Welles reveals some truths about the friendship between Ernest Hemingway and Welles:
The manuscript, presented in a new study on Welles, reflects his disdain for a type of macho tourist frequently spotted in Spain when mass travel to the country took off in the 1960s. Intended to form the basis of of a love-triangle drama, the script features an American bullfighting aficionado, clearly inspired by Hemingway, as the lead character.</description>

They were inspired by George R.R.

He made the startling claim that if he had the manuscript done by the end of the year, the publishers were going to have the book ready by the end of March.</description>

      <title>How to make a $400 book entirely from scratch</title>

      <description>The music is terrible, the presentation glib, and the $400 only accounts for mininum-wage labor, not materials (like the cost of the animals slaughtered).
But, this video is valuable for showing just what goes into making the materials of a very rustic book. Making a refined book is only easy due to the scale of industry.
Watching this reminds me that books are a technology, and like any technology, the methods of production have been perfected over time, until books became so ubiquitous that the process of making them completely dissapeared, and all we are left to think about is the content inside of them.</description>

      <description>This morning, Pioneer Square&amp;rsquo;s Seattle Mystery Bookshop launched a GoFundMe campaign &amp;ldquo;to make sure the rent is completely paid off, all our suppliers are happy, and to restore missing titles and depleted series to our shelves.&amp;rdquo; Their goal is to raise $50,000. Rewards for the campaign include signed first editions, a noirish 1974 Michael Garmin sculpture, tote bags, and coffee cups.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more about what makes Seattle Mystery Bookshop so great, we have a whole series of pieces explaining just that â they were our Bookstore of the Month back in September.</description>

Originally from Gorham, Maine â coincidentally, one town over from my native Buxton â poet Greg Bem moved to Seattle and immediately started building a community of artists and writers. Heâs thrown a bunch of events all around town (youâll read more about those in a second)Â and his passion for intelligent, challenging work has improved the quality of discourse in Seattleâs art scene. Bemâs newest project is a weeklong series of free readings at Seattle Center titled [Ghost Tokens: Inumbrating Pinnacle](http://gregbem.</description>

      <description>Now that Mein Kampf is back in the headlines â thanks a lot, Germany â Adam Gopnik reviews the book for The New Yorker.
...the striking thing about the text as a text is that it is not so much diabolical or sinister as *creepy*. It is the last book in the world that you would expect a nascent Fascist dictator to write... Hitler, whom we suspect of being an embittered, envious, traumatized loser, presents himself as .</description>

      <description>Yesterday saw the publication of the ninth and final issue of Jonathan Hickman and Esad Ribic&amp;rsquo;s Marvel Comics mega-crossover event, Secret Wars. The series, which works as both a remake of Marvel&amp;rsquo;s 1984 crossover comic of the same name and a reboot of the entire line of Marvel&amp;rsquo;s superhero comics, has been huge and goofy and fun.
You can&amp;rsquo;t really explain Secret Wars to someone who has no prior experience with Marvel Comics.</description>

      <description>The Arkansas-born poet who published with Copper Canyon Press died unexpectedly and Rich Smith, and there will undoubtedly be more in the days and weeks ahead.
For right now, I&amp;rsquo;d like to send your attention to a recording of Wright reading her own poem &amp;ldquo;Everything Good Between Men and Women&amp;rdquo; at the Poetry Foundation. It&amp;rsquo;s a loud, lively, even raucous poem that starts with a bang (the title flows dircectly into the opening lines, &amp;ldquo;has been written in mud and butter/and barbecue sauce&amp;rdquo;) and concludes with a demand for the reader to &amp;ldquo;Call it a night.</description>

      <description>An anonymous Seattle apartment building owner is running an essay contest. The winner gets to live rent-free in a &amp;ldquo;clean, comfortable place&amp;rdquo; in Queen Anne or Ballard for a year. The essays are supposed to respond to the question &amp;ldquo;How would a free apartment for one year help you reach your goals in 10 years?&amp;rdquo; in 350 words or less. You can&amp;rsquo;t solve gentrification with a writing contest, but at least the odds are better than Powerball.</description>

Last week, I erroneously referred to this monthâs Bookstore of the Month as Push/Pull Gallery. That&amp;rsquo;s my mistake; itâs just Push/Pull. Thereâs a reason why founder Maxx Follis decided to drop the descriptors from the name â itâs because the space performs many functions at the same time. Yes, itâs a gallery. And yes, itâs a bookstore providing one of the biggest selections of small press comics in the city.</description>

      <description>Letâs lay it out as simply as possible: Marian Engelâs Bear is a novel about a woman who has an erotic relationship with a bear. As you can imagine, this is the sort of premise that probably makes book cover artists lick their lips with anticipation.
![](/webhook-uploads/1452487751509/PaperbackCoverofBearbyMarianEngel.jpg)
To the left of this paragraph, youâll see the 1976 book cover for the paperback release of Bear. It is, as promotional materials for a newer edition of the book claim, âHeavy Metal-inspired,&amp;rdquo; which is to say that it is lurid and shocking and fun, and also aimed directly at the adolescent male gaze.</description>

with chandeliers of sand. A man said
one is the loneliest number, but this

you out, but my hair parted, and there
you were. Part of me, do you smart
with the sting of the repressed? Iâm blessed,

      <description>A singular talent, a life-saving artist who constructed a brilliant career, and a passionate reader: to call David Bowie one-in-a-million would be to seriously devalue his uniqueness. Maybe he was one-in-a-species, but he made us all feel like we could be better people. There&amp;rsquo;s not a single dud on his top-100 book list, which was found and shared this morning by Lincoln Michel at Electric Literature. Also, the Seattle Public Library has put together a list of Bowie-related books for you.</description>

Jacqui Shine examines the history of the &amp;ldquo;lighter&amp;rdquo; side of the news.
 Womenâs news was the opposite of important, with close ties to so-called yellow journalism. Joseph Pulitzer is credited with developing womenâs news largely as a means of attracting new readers and, in turn, new advertisers. When Pulitzer bought the New York _World_ in 1883, the paper had already had a âwomanâs newsâ (as they called it) department for over twenty years.</description>

Clinton visited Elliott Bay in Pioneer Square at least once while he was sitting president, and he did at least one signing there, for his (incredibly dull) memoir My Life.</description>

If youâve been on the internet at all, you probably saw it in one iteration or another, be it .gif or Vine or remixed music video: a raccoon is slavering over a brick of cotton candy. Being a raccoon, it goes to wash the cotton candy in a nearby pool of water. Being cotton candy, the block disintegrates as soon as the raccoon dips it in the water.</description>

      <guid>http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/announcing-the-seattle-review-of-books-kickstarter-fund/</guid>
      <description>Each week in 2016 we are going to invest $20 in a Kickstarter project. On Saturdays, starting tomorrow January 9, we&amp;rsquo;ll be reporting on the Kickstarter we back, and how the fund is going.
That gives us 52 Saturdays in 2016, so the fund is 52 x $20, or $1040. If a Kickstarter we back fails, we&amp;rsquo;ll put that $20 into another project, allowing us to increase our pledges if we deem a project worthy.</description>

      <description>This afternoon, the APRIL Festival (it stands for Authors, Publishers, and Readers of Independent Literature) announced the schedule for their fifth annual celebration of small-press writing and reading, and it looks pretty goddamned spectacular. As previously announced, the writer-in-residence for this yearâs APRIL is Jenny Zhang, a talented poet and wonderful essayist out of Brooklyn. Zhangâs star is on the rise, and her role as writer-in-residence will undoubtedly give the festival some national prominence.</description>

      <description>KUOW has the news that our state&amp;rsquo;s poet laureate for the next two years will be Tod Marshall, a professor at Spokane&amp;rsquo;s Gonzaga University. You can find an audio sample of Marshall&amp;rsquo;s work on KUOW&amp;rsquo;s site. You can also find more samples of Marshall&amp;rsquo;s work at the ever-indispensible Poetry Foundation. &amp;ldquo;Describe Turner to MLK&amp;rdquo; combines a harrowing eye injury with race and history in a way that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure is entirely successful, but it is certainly ambitious.</description>

      <description>Paul Tobin and Alberto J. Alburquerqueâs comic Mystery Girl, now on its second issue, is an absolute delight so far. Hereâs the little blurb at the beginning of each book that explains the premise:
Trine Hampstead knows everything. No mystery is too small or too weird for Londonâs premier sidewalk detective â and she truly knows it all, from your most personal secrets to the details of the deepest, most incredible conspiracies.</description>

Today, APRIL announced that the winner of their contest is Jessica Mooney, who you can follow on Twitter right now. SRoB cofounder Martin McClellan and I chose the winning entry, and it took a lot of deliberation.</description>

      <description>Brian Tashman at Right Wing Watch says:
In a meeting with *The Des Moines Register*âs editorial board today, Ben Carson defended his proposal to crack down on political bias on college campuses by saying that the Department of Education should have the power to **secretly monitor classrooms and libraries** to root out and uncover potential bias. I&amp;rsquo;ll just come out and say this: if you believe the government should be spying on libraries and classrooms and other places where books and reading are sacrosanct, you are an enemy of America.</description>

When did you start, exactly?
I started January 1st.  So you did start January 1st, so itâs *almost* a full year.</description>

      <description>This morning, the comics internet blew up when the long list for this year&amp;rsquo;s prestigious French comics award, the Grand Prix dâAngouleme, was announced. The list of 30 candidates did not include one single female cartoonist. And in case your first instinct was to mansplain this fact away âÂ &amp;rdquo;durr, but maybe no woman produced a comic worthy of awards this year,&amp;rdquo; I can hear the gamergate crowd grumbling, as though that made any sense at all â you should bear in mind that in the Grand Prix&amp;rsquo;s 43 years, only one woman has ever won the award.</description>

      <description>As you likely already know, the Hugo House building will be torn down this spring and a six-story mixed-use development will be built on the site. The Hugo House is scheduled to reopen in the new building sometime in 2018. (Mary Ann Gwinn published a preview of the new House in the Seattle Times last week.) But until today, we didnât know where the House would be operating during the interim.</description>

Long shot wolf
Long shot girl
Long shot deer
Long shot dog
Close-up shot little monkey
My dear sweetheart,
Where does the North begin?
Wolfang, Fang, Flash and Flame
My darling cotton wooly hotel
A tiny house is expensive
At the edge of the sea
What is happiness, Love?
My dear sweetheart&amp;mdash;

      <description>Today, Nick Licata is retiring from the Seattle City Council after four terms. He leaves behind a very impressive legacy. Licata was the most progressive member of the council at a time when Seattle was experimenting with a very prickly east coast version of urbanism, exemplified by Mark Sidranâs atrocious civility laws and Joe Mallahanâs dumb corporate paternalism. And the council that is being sworn in today is more liberal, in part, because of Licataâs tireless advocacy for liberal causes.</description>

 But the discussion reflects a broader truth: We live in an age in which machine intelligence has become a part of daily life. Computers fly planes and soon will drive cars. Computer algorithms anticipate our needs and decide which advertisements to show us.</description>

      <description>Every day, friend of the SRoB Rahawa Haile tweets a short story. She gave us permission to collect them every week. She&#39;s archiving the entire project on Storify. This is the last wrap-up, since the project is now over. We&#39;d like to offer Rahawa a hearty congratulations on a big project nicely executed. We&#39;ll miss seeing the stories every day, but still have many to comb through, and even some to read again.</description>

      <title>New Years Day</title>

      <description>After Thanksgiving, New Years Day is my favorite holiday. Unlike the gifts of Christmas or the costumes of Halloween, New Yearâs Day brings with it no obligations. Youâre just supposed to relax, and not work, and think about the year that just ended and the year that just began. If youâre hungover, maybe the day is about regret. If youâve made a series of resolutions, maybe itâs about hope. But itâs a day that is profoundly uninterested in itself.</description>

      <description>Seattle cartoonist Tom Van Deusenâs newest book, EAT EAT EAT, is the latest entry in a long comics tradition: a humorous book about a feckless loser who doesnât possess the self-awareness to realize that he is a feckless loser. Itâs a somewhat proud (if self-loathing) lineage, stretching to Chris Ware and Ivan Brunetti from R. Crumb and Dan Clowes and on and on and on.
&amp;lt; EAT EAT EAT is the story of a feckless loser named Tom Van Deusen (the indicia informs us that the book âis a work of pure fiction.</description>

      <description>Even the most complimentary reviews of Star Wars: The Force Awakens mention that the movie is for all intents and purposes a remake of Star Wars: A New Hope. Critics who loved the film tended to refer to the fact that itâs a remake as an aside; critics who disliked the film based their entire reviews around it. This is not automatically a strike against Force so much as a reality of moviemaking today.</description>

      <description>A quick reminder: you can still sign up for the 6-week book reviewing class that Martin McClellan and I are teaching at Hugo House. We intend to discuss the purpose of book reviews, what it takes to make a book review into something more than just a GoodReads blurb or a boring plot synopsis, and the many different forms a book review can take. We&amp;rsquo;re also going to get into some very important ideas: why responding to art is necessary, how to become a better reader, and why books are so important.</description>

      <description>Galleycat says:
Adolf Hitlerâs anti-Semitic manifesto *Mein Kampf* has been banned from Germany for 70 years, but will return to German bookstores next month. So many factors are at play here â atrocity, history, copyright, the free exchange of ideas â that really all we can do is wait and watch what happens. Will German bookstores carry Mein Kampf? Will people buy it? What happens when the most hateful, reviled, and influential book in the history of a nation becomes readily available again?</description>

      <description>This time it is no dream. After twenty-three years away
I wake in a Spokane convent in my Black Watch
plaid pajamas &amp;mdash; daybreak, the last
day of September 1996. I used to spring from bed
at the bell&amp;rsquo;s first clang. Now there&amp;rsquo;s
something wrong with the bedsprings
I cannot fix.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Shyly, light enters, spills over
the floor of the room. Holy or not, I
feel more at home than in thirty-eight</description>

Her latest The Jesus Gene is a thriller that wonders what would happen if a modern-day person really did carry the bloodline of Jesus Christ. Read the prologue on our sponsors page.

      <description>Over at The Washington Post, which is owned by Jeff Bezos, Michael S. Rosenwald has written a story titled &amp;ldquo;In the age of Amazon, used bookstores are making an unlikely comeback.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s about how, anecdotally, used bookstores have been doing better after years of decline. Rosenwald also profies some new bookstores that are getting into used books. You should read the whole thing.

      <description>âWith respect, Iâm as good a man as Kennedy,â Vice President Richard Nixon tells Dwight Eisenhower. But his boss is having none of it. Ike spits back:
âYouâre a climbing little rat. The way you went after Hiss, the way youâve got on TV and spilled your guts, the way you begged for it. Youâre bent, Dick. You were by a long way the sorriest son of a bitch I could get for the job.</description>

      <description>The Darkness Before the Right Park MacDougald in a long piece examining a particualrly American conservatism that&amp;rsquo;s he&amp;rsquo;s coined, neoreactionism:
 As the twenty-first century gets darker, politics are likely to follow suit, and for all its apparent weirdness, neoreaction may be an early warning system for what a future anti-democratic right looks like. So what is neoreaction, then, exactly? For all the talk of neo-feudalism and geeks for monarchy, itâs less a single ideology than a loose constellation of far-right thought, clustered around three pillars: religious traditionalism, white nationalism, and techno-commercialism (the names are self-explanatory).</description>

      <description>Early in the darkness of Christmas Eve, on top of Capitol Hill, over by Volunteer Park in the old section where the mansions loom, four young women stood on an unlit porch, pressed against the door, their backs turned to a driving downpour.
In the front of the group Imani struggled with her keys, going through a few before finding the one that took purchase. A shriek cut the air, the hinges of the door complaining from uncommon use.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite Christmas traditions is ghost stories. A Christmas Carol comes to mind first, of course. It has its own delights, to be sure â especially in reading, as opposed to the many dramatic renditions which have rendered it more toothless and hackneyed than it deserves. The story still has some spook and humor left in it, thanks to Dickens&amp;rsquo; steady lyrical hand. Look how he described just how despicable Scrooge is:</description>

Turns out, the Grinch stole New Comics Day this week: the heavy snowfall at Snoqualmie Pass meant that the Diamond Distribution truck carrying all the new comics intended to arrive in Seattle today was stuck on the east side of the mountains. No comics store in the entire Seattle area received any new comics yesterday.</description>

      <description>Did you know that Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, is a real dillhole? It&amp;rsquo;s true! And the Tumblr MRA Dilbert performs a real public service by publishing Scott Adams&amp;rsquo;s actual words in the word balloons of his characters. This is such a clever way to comment on Adams&amp;rsquo; toxic beliefs. Contrasting them with the bland inoccuousness of his cartoons â although calling Adams&amp;rsquo;s drawing &amp;ldquo;cartoons&amp;rdquo; feels like an insult to cartooning â lays all the ugliness of his ideas and work out for anyone to see.</description>

      <description>Elliott Bay Book Company event coordinator Rick Simonson first met Barbara Abdeni Massaad when she was in Seattle to help Wassef Haroun prepare to open the restaurant that would eventually become Mamnoon. The Mamnoon crew would meet for planning sessions over coffee in Elliott Bayâs cafe, and eventually they came to be fixtures at the bookstore. Massaad even attended Elliott Bayâs exclusive, invite-only 40th anniversary party â âshe had come farther than anyone for our party, from Beirut,â Simonson recalls.</description>

      <description>The children of a candidate for a statewide position are kidnapped by a death cult. The candidate, not wanting a high-profile media investigation so close to election day, hires a pair of investigators to quietly bring his kids back. From there, things get ugly.
Thatâs the plot of Nelly Reiflerâs most recent novel. The catch is that the candidate and his children are mice, and the investigators the candidate hires are Barbie and Ken.</description>

drowse under the shower, a preview of
bodies the children try on
with their eyes.

This year&amp;rsquo;s Search for Meaning slate includes spiritual writer Tracy Kidder; Suki Kim, who went undercover in North Korea and lived to tell the tale; and journalist Sam QuiÃ±ones.

      <description>Iâm not a Whovian. Iâve seen and enjoyed a few episodes of the Doctor Who season where the Doctor was played by Christopher Eccleston, but I donât have the patience to immerse myself in the dense continuity and playful self-indulgence of Doctor Who fandom. The hours I contribute to television-watching are relatively few, and I tend to be a completist about these sorts of things. I donât have enough hours in my life to contribute to the cause of watching all the Doctor Who episodes out there floating around the streaming sites.</description>

      <description>[Men Explain Lolita To Me](http://lithub.com/men-explain-lolita-to-me/) Rebecca Solnit, after writing a piece mocking Esquire&amp;rsquo;s infamous &amp;ldquo;80 Books Every Man Should Read&amp;rdquo;, got things explained to her by white men. Thankfully, she&amp;rsquo;s wonderful at explaining things back. It was hard to find a quote from this essay to pull here, since there were many paragraphs I wanted to quote, but this one in particular I found very affecting:
 There is a common attack on art that thinks it is a defense.</description>

Since Rahawa is ending this project at the end of the year, this is the third-to-last posting of our wrap-up. Two more to go, and then we launch something new on Saturdays, starting January 10th.

Zombies, zombies everywhere. Who the hell isnât a little sick of zombies at this point? Even people who love carnage and a little fictional gunplay ought to be getting sick of zombies by now, right? You can stretch the metaphor like a wad of chewing gum â the zombies stand for consumerism, or they represent our germ-phobia, or they represent our self-loathing â but eventually that thin pink strand is gonna break.</description>

      <description>Shelf Awareness, which broke the news about Amazon Books, continues to raise questions about the brick-and-mortar outpost of Amazon.com:
Is Amazon Books getting its stock from Amazon.com, which gets extra terms unavailable to most bricks-and-mortar retailers? Are books being bought non-returnable by Amazon.com but being returned by Amazon Books to Amazon.com? How, if at all, is a distinction made between the two businesses--and how will that be handled at meetings in which the bookstore buyers participate?</description>

      <description>Last week, I contracted norovirus. It was terrible, and Iâm not going to tell you any more about it except to say that I wound up in bed for 36 hours, feeling awful. I couldnât watch movies. I couldnât read poetry or prose. All I could stand to read, all I could focus my attention on for more than a minute at a time, was comic books. This has pretty much always been true for me; whenever I come down with an illness bad enough to send me to bed, I wind up reading comics.</description>

Whether you prefer to read stories of old couples or young couples; whirlwind romances or thoughtful, long relationships; couples with opposite interests or couples who are practically clones of each other; youâll find a pairing here that speaks to you.</description>

      <description>Secret Garden Books owner Christy McDanold has a lot of favorite books going at any one time. When I asked her to name one choice for a holiday recommendation, she seems proud to have narrowed it down to just two.
![](/webhook-uploads/1450135132044/617PGb7J6aL._SX361_BO1%2C204%2C203%2C200_.jpg)
Her first choice is [*Maps*, an âartful, rich atlas of the worldâ hand-drawn by Aleksandra and Daniel Mizielinska](http://www.secretgardenbooks.com/book/9780763668969), a Polish couple who are best-known for their popular typefaces. McDanold canât stop gushing over *Maps*, calling the book âclever and creative,â and a gorgeous gift idea for âanyone who loves maps.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve done our best to avoid Star Wars mania here on the Seattle Review of Books, but even we can&amp;rsquo;t ignore this J.G. Ballard review of the original movie from 1977. He calls the film &amp;ldquo;totally unoriginal, feebly plotted, instantly forgettable, and an acoustic nightmare.&amp;rdquo; At least one of those descriptions has been proven wrong by the march of time. But the rest of Ballard&amp;rsquo;s argument, that science fiction is a serious literary trend and that Star Wars is not a fair representation of good science fiction, is an interesting one.</description>

      <description>Congratulations to Seattle poet Storme Webber for winning a Frye Art Museum | Artist Trust Consortium 2015 James W. Ray Award. That $15,000 prize will undoubtedly go toward the creation of some exciting new writing that Webber will share in one of her many readings around town. Thatâs exactly what an award like this is for; it provides income to pillars of the community who work in fields (like, say, poetry) that donât pay very well.</description>

      <description>Eugene M. Babb spent a life in gigs, and then wrote about it. His book Grit and Roses, published by Third Place Press (yes! Third Place books has a press! They print books on their Espresso Book Machine, Ginger), covers his thirty years of life as a working musician.
We have two expcerpts from this short, sharply told book on our sponsors page. How wonderful to have a local author, published by a local press, as a sponsor this week.</description>

      <description>Book shopping for teenagers can be daunting, but they make excellent gifts and provide plenty of opportunities to introduce young adults to new authors to love. Here are some recommendations of books both new and old for the 13-and-up crowd that are worth adding to your shopping list.
Daniel JosÃ© Olderâs fierce and fantastic heroine Sierra â Buffy has nothing on this young womanÂ â takes on family history and the forces of darkness in the heritage-embracing Shadowshaper, while Robyn Loxley finds herself forced to take on the power-mad governor of Nott City after her family is attacked and she must run for her life in Shadows of Sherwood by Kekla Magoon.</description>

      <title>Jonathan Evison to close Sundance 2016</title>

      <description>The bad news is that the film adaptation of local author Jonathan Evison&amp;rsquo;s spectacular novel The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving has been changed. It&amp;rsquo;s now The Fundamentals of Caring, a title that sacrifices specificity at the altar of sentiment.
But! Here&amp;rsquo;s the good news: it stars Paul Rudd, so I will still be there for this movie whenever it opens locally. And here&amp;rsquo;s the even-better news: it was announced last week that The Fundamentals of Caring will be the Closing Film at this coming year&amp;rsquo;s Sundance film festival, a position of pride that indicates confidence in the quality of the film.</description>

Janet Wolfe was quite obviously a brilliant force of nature. But more than this, Margalit Fox practically re-animates her with luxuriant and vivid prose. What a joy to read.

That&amp;rsquo;s why instead of blurbs and jacket copy alone, we offer you a full chapter to read from our sponsors. Just like in a bookstore when you pick up an unknown writer and take a look to see if you like them.</description>

      <description>Nancy Pearl at Town Hall is our official Sunday pick, but before you head there you should drop by Fantagraphics and say hey to Laura Knetzger, from 1-3pm. She&amp;rsquo;s throwing a release party for Bug Boys.
Bug Boys is a compendium of the comic of the same name, and it is really marvelous. Head down for her official release party, pick up the book and give a local hard-working comic artist some love and sales.</description>

      <description>Awesome Seattle cartoonist Ellen Forney&amp;rsquo;s giant portraits of hands have finally been installed at the Capitol Hill light rail station, which is (and I am pants-wettingly excited about this) set to open early next year. Tonight at 5 pm, Forney will be on hand at the station as part of the Capitol Hill Art Walk to sort-of christen the new artwork with hot beverages and a public party. If you&amp;rsquo;re a Forney fan â as everyone who&amp;rsquo;s read Marbles or I Love Led Zeppelin undoubtedly is â you should show up for this one.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve said many times that I&amp;rsquo;m not fond of year-end best-of book lists. Year-end lists, so far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned, are like junk food: they&amp;rsquo;re enjoyable, but they&amp;rsquo;re probably not worth the time you put into reading (or writing) them. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for what the Seattle Review of Books believes to be the books of the year, I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to look back through our Reviews section. Our co-founder Martin McClellan ingeniously constructed the Reviews pages to be something like browsing a bookstore.</description>

      <description>UNESCO just released their full list of new members of the Creative Cities Network. Seattle, which was making its second bid to become a City of Literature, is not on that list. UNESCO does not make its deliberations public, but it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to come up with reasons why we might not have made the list this year.
The sad thing is, after the unpleasantness of the spring passed, our City of Literature organization found a terrific, capable leader in Bob Redmond.</description>

      <description>In the back pages of the first issue of the new series Symmetry, writer Matt Hawkins admits heâs âgotten a bit sick ofâ dystopiaâs omnipresence, and so he decided to try writing utopian fiction, instead. He read Sir Thomas Moreâs Utopia (âitâs boring as hell,â Hawkins tells his readers, urging them to âskim itâ) and embarked on months of research, determining the four qualities of all utopias in fiction (ambition, creativity, diversity, and instruments of capital must be eliminated) and what he believes to be the four pillars of society (community, peace, harmony, and equality are required).</description>

      <description>For some time now, City Councilmember Nick Licata has sponsored a neat event at City Hall called the Words&amp;rsquo; Worth Poetry Series. Selected poets would read a poem to kick off City Council meetings. It was a small gesture, but an important one: it&amp;rsquo;s always good to remind the City Council that the arts is what makes Seattle so wonderfully livable.
Today, Seattle poet Sierra Nelson says:
City Councilmember Nick Licata is leaving City Council at the end of this term, and to celebrate his innovative Wordsâ Worth Poetry Series and legacy of championing the arts in Seattle, current Wordsâ Worth curator, poet and performer Sierra Nelson, has invited past curators and readers to return to Seattle City Hall (600 4th Ave, City Council meeting room) on Wednesday, December 9th, 2015, 2:00-2:15 p.</description>

I pick it up all the time, and itâs always better than I remembered. There is a unique effect of these writers, their letters soothe my mind, the way the exact right word can be both calming and exciting no matter the topic. Their letters make being a person seem like a reasonable way to spend time.</description>

We just got word from the good folks at Short Run Comix and Arts Festival that the National Endowment for the Arts awarded them a grant for their 2016 festival. (It&amp;rsquo;s been a good couple days for Seattle&amp;rsquo;s standing in arts awards.) A quick search of the paperwork reveals that Short Run was awarded $15,000 by the NEA. Other local winners include SIFF, the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, the Seattle Opera, and, on the literary side of things, Town Hall Seattle, which also picked up $15,000.</description>

      <description>The jokes write themselves. Shortly after the publication of Future Visions: Science Fiction Stories Inspired By Microsoft, a friend posted a graphic about it. In the image, Clippy, the infamous animated paperclip/Microsoft Office assistant, is saying, &amp;ldquo;Hi! It looks like you&amp;rsquo;re trying to dock over Alpha Centauri! May I suggest reverse thrusters?&amp;rdquo;
There&amp;rsquo;s just no way to resist poking fun at any company publishing a book &amp;ldquo;inspired&amp;rdquo; by itself. Imagine &amp;ldquo;Caffeinated Comedy: Knock-Knock Jokes About Starbucks&amp;rsquo; Pumpkin Spice Latte,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Tape-Filled Tomes: Adventure Stories In Which 3M&amp;rsquo;s Post-It Notes Save the Day.</description>

      <description>Father Giuliano, the drama instructor, fainted
every time he saw blood.
When a nun in the class, newly acquainted
with stagecraft,
fed a hand to the band saw, Giuliano was the one
who had to be treated. My mother
applauded the hero.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At the first clap of thunder,
she ran to the bureau for the rosary.
All through a stormy upbringing
under the kitchen sink after dark,
I repeated my lines.</description>

      <description>Escaped serial killers, wives behaving badly, psychics getting embroiled in police work, and all in our own back yard? Gregg Olsen brings it all in his second book in the Waterman/Stark series.
We&amp;rsquo;re so pleased to have him as a sponsor this week, and you can read a full chapter from his new book Now That She&amp;rsquo;s Gone on our sponsor page. You&amp;rsquo;ll be glad you did.
It&amp;rsquo;s because of sponsors like Olsen that we were able to sell-out our initial run of sponsorship slots.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wondered how art collectors decide which artists to collect &amp;mdash; not the profit driven monsters who play galleries like traders play the markets, but true fans who love art and emerging artists, who show up early and often, and buy many pieces by new talent. But it dawned me while I read Molly Crabapple&amp;rsquo;s memoir Drawing Blood: they learn the artist&amp;rsquo;s story. When you learn someone&amp;rsquo;s story, you forge an empathetic lock with them.</description>

      <description>MONDAY Your week begins at Third Place Books in Lake Forest Park. Tonight, theyâre hosting Christopher T. Bayley, author of Seattle Justice: The Rise and Fall of the Police Payoff System in Seattle. For all its political faults, one thing youâve got to give Seattle: in comparison to east coast cities, itâs remarkably free from corruption. (Many would argue that this lack of corruption is why itâs very hard to get major infrastructure projects done in this town.</description>

      <description>[Jury Duty](https://medium.com/@jurornumber5/jury-duty-b354a53f126e#.6e8l66dws) A remarkable story of jury duty, told by a black man. Very honest, very raw. Very anonymous, for obvious reasons.
There are twelve of us left. The first thing the prosecutor did during voir dire was ask all the men of color whether we trusted cops. Every black man had a story: police harassment, spurious arrests, intimidation. They were all eliminated. I was asked if I had any experiences of this kind, and I said no.</description>

To that end, [Barnes &amp; Noble Chief Executive Ron] Boire is leading a push to rebrand Barnes &amp; Noble as more than just a bookstore by expanding its offerings of toys, games, gadgets and other gifts and reshaping the nationâs largest bookstore chain into a âlifestyle brand.â You might argue that Barnes &amp;amp; Noble won&amp;rsquo;t be able to survive by just selling books. I would refute your argument by pointing out that Barnes &amp;amp; Noble stores are already stuffed to the rafters with cheap plastic crap.</description>

      <description>Now is the time to apply for the Clarion West summer workshop. Yes, it does cost money to apply (though it costs less to apply now than it will cost later on) but Clarion West is maybe the best education organization in America for aspiring sci-fi and fantasy writers. And their mission statement is so goddamned good:
Speculative fiction â science fiction, fantasy, horror, magic realism, and slipstream â gives voice to those who explore societal and technological change, along with deeper considerations of underlying archetypes of human experience.</description>

      <title>NaNoWriMo Week 6: Now you finish your novel</title>

      <description>Even if you made 50,000 words and finished NaNoWriMo, your novel isn&amp;rsquo;t finished yet. You knew this already, right? You know what the haters say: that NaNoWriMo unleashes thousands of terrible novels into the world. It&amp;rsquo;s as if some evil force were holding those poor people captive, forcing them to read every cliched phrase that comes in front of their eyeballs. It&amp;rsquo;s as if they have no taste.
But, of course, the little secret of NaNoWriMo is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t unleash terrible novels into the world.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re generally in favor of awards here at the Seattle Review of Books. We don&amp;rsquo;t put too much truck in them â awards are not the end of a certain type of literary conversation; they&amp;rsquo;re the beginning. But (as long as they don&amp;rsquo;t overly favor straight white men) awards are fun, and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to publicly recognize the hard work that goes into the writing of books.
There&amp;rsquo;s one award we don&amp;rsquo;t much like, though.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re big fans of Seattle poet EJ Koh, and we think you should be big fans of EJ Koh, too. If you need an introduction, you should read this interview with Koh published in Hoctok. I especially like that the interview is broken up with Koh&amp;rsquo;s poetry; it&amp;rsquo;s surprising that more literary interview outlets don&amp;rsquo;t liberally intersperse their interviews with actual examples of the writers&amp;rsquo; work. Seeing an author&amp;rsquo;s thoughts and words in such close proximity to each other provides a more immersive experience for the reader.</description>

      <description>Michel Houellebecq is a terrible person. He is also, if his translators have done their job correctly, an excellent writer. This isnât a rarity â plenty of writers are awful people. But unlike many of the worst people who write, Houellebecq doesnât try to conceal his awfulness. Instead, he revels in it.
Houellebecq has made a career out of provocation. His essay praising H.P. Lovecraftâs ahuman tendencies is probably the best critical reappraisal of Lovecraft ever written.</description>

      <description>Every once in a while, a truly individual voice will emerge out of the morass of conventional superhero comics. These occasions are always a surprise â nobody could have predicted that Swamp Thing would become a convergence point between art and commercial comics until Alan Moore and Steve Bissette landed on the book, and nobody expected much of Daredevil until Frank Miller was allowed to get experimental with the character. Itâs too early to draw a comparison Tom King and Gabriel Hernandez Waltaâs The Vision to those two examples, but two issues into the series, itâs already clear that the book is something special.</description>

      <description>Teju Cole published a poem at the New Inquiry in response to today&amp;rsquo;s terrible news out of San Bernardino. It&amp;rsquo;s a moving reminder that poetry can respond to current events, can be as timely as a thinkpiece, can be so much more meaningful than a hot take on Twitter.</description>

 A signed copy of Seattle cartoonist Colleen Frakes&amp;rsquo;s memoir Prison Island, along with a piece of original art. (Read my review of Prison Island here.)
 A watercolor painting by newly local cartoonist Sarah Glidden.

      <description>At 2 pm, Bainbridge Island author Jonathan Evison, author of novels like This Is Your Life, Harriet Chance! and the excellent The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving will be doing an Ask Me Anything on Reddit. Follow this link and, well, ask Evison anything. In my experience, he&amp;rsquo;s always been remarkably open in interviews, from the business side of things to what he thinks of other writers. I can pretty much guarantee he&amp;rsquo;ll be painfully honest, which makes this an interesting opportunity for those burning questions you&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to drop on a novelist.</description>

      <description>In the December issue of the New York Review of Books, Doubleday executive editor Gerald Howard takes on reviewer Daniel Mendelsohn for his review of the Doubleday novel A Little Life. Howard&amp;rsquo;s letter concludes: &amp;ldquo;At bottom Mendelsohn seems to have decided that A Little Life just appeals to the wrong kind of reader. Thatâs an invidious distinction unworthy of a critic of his usually fine discernment.&amp;rdquo;
This is not the only charge levied against this particular reviewer and this particular review.</description>

Alex Gholz, bookseller at Third Place Books Ravenna, has eclectic tastes. His recent reading of James S.A. Coreyâs Leviathan Wakes put him on a brief space opera kick â heâs right now reading Alatair Reynoldâs Revelation Space, and after that heâs planning to dive into Seth Dickinsonâs political fantasy novel The Traitor Baru Cormorant.</description>

      <description>See You in the Morning, Mairead Caseâs debut novel, is a love story if a love story means trying to become someone who doesnât always feel shut off. Itâs the summer before senior year in high school, and the unnamed narrator is already planning to move away from a town thatâs maybe too comfortable or not comfortable enough, not dreamy but not dreary â maybe there arenât enough options, but what options is this narrator looking for?</description>

      <description>Last month, the Seattle poetry world lost one of its giants when Madeline DeFrees passed away. DeFrees was one of the most vibrant, evocative poets the Pacific Northwest has ever produced, and the Seattle Review of Books wanted to find some way to honor her life, and to bring her work to new audiences. Hereâs one way to do that: every Tuesday for the month of December, weâll present a DeFrees poem.</description>

      <description>Four-thirty, morning. Unearthly time
by nuns&amp;rsquo; or any standard;
almost, this soggy May, monastic.
I close my door on sleep
for other sanctuary,
preceded by the birds
who long ago devised
their daylight saving.
Now, saving the daylight,
no other shape abroad
but the swinging step of rain
on rain-soaked turf.
Unbreakable as doom
five streetlamps watch me come
to keep my tryst.
Nailed each to a man-made cross,
usual as air,</description>

Chatwin Books is a local affair, tackling ambitious publishing projects of high quality. Sarracoo is a unique voice, and Karate Bride is a great way to get to know her work before reading Lit by Lightning.</description>

      <description>The introduction to Destiny and Power, the new biography of George H.W. Bush, makes it pretty clear where Jon Meachamâs loyalty as a biographer lies. Bush, Meacham writes, âwas driven less by ideas about politics than by an ideal of service and an ambition â a consuming one â to win.â He continues:
Americans unhappy with the reflexively polarized politics of the first decades of the twenty-first century will find the presidency of George H.</description>

      <description>Dianna Dilworth at GalleyCat writes:
A Wisconsin elementary school has cancelled the reading of a childrenâs book about a transgender girl after parents threatened to sue claiming that the reading would be a violation of parents rights. The book in question is I Am Jazz, written by Jessica Herthel and Jazz Jennings, and illustrated by Shelagh McNicholas. These bigoted parents need to understand that banning a book never works; it only results in more copies sold and increased interest.</description>

      <description>As the co-founder of this site put it in September, we are living in a golden age of publishing. Social media, the Espresso Book Machine and yes, even Amazonâs e-book arm have collapsed the distance between writer and audience, and in some cases entirely circumvented the need for traditional publishers.
In the face of these near-instantaneous platforms, those traditional publishers start to look like hidebound anachronisms, stubbornly inefficient relics from a bygone, pre-digital age.</description>

      <description>MONDAY Happy new week! Iâm sorry to report that tonightâs reading with xkcdâs Randall Munro and Hank Green at Town Hall is sold out. Instead, you should visit Campion Ballroom at Seattle University for Jon Meacham. Meacham is an excellent presidential biographer, and his newest book is about George Herbert Walker Bush. Destiny and Power is a much-needed spotlight on the somewhat-reasonable-in-retrospect man who sired two dullards with presidential aspirations.</description>

      <description>[The Most Misread Poem in America](http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/09/11/the-most-misread-poem-in-america/) David Orr, in an excerpt from his book The Road Not Taken: Finding America in the Poem Everyone Loves and Almost Everyone Gets Wrong, on Robert Frost&amp;rsquo;s best known poem.
 Frostâs poem turns this expectation on its head. Most readers consider âThe Road Not Takenâ to be a paean to triumphant self-assertion (âI took the one less traveled byâ), but the literal meaning of the poemâs own lines seems completely at odds with this interpretation.</description>

      <description>*Every Friday, Cienna Madrid offers solutions to lifeâs most vexing literary problems. Well, except for this Friday because it&#39;s Thanksgiving weekend and Cienna&#39;s probably drunk somewhere. We didn&#39;t want to leave you hanging, dear reader, so we thought we&#39;d republish the very first Help Desk column from way back in July, in case you didn&#39;t read it. Next week, Help Desk will return. Do you have questions for Cienna? Send them to* advice@seattlereviewofbooks.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re at the point in your book where you&amp;rsquo;re talking to yourself, aren&amp;rsquo;t you? You&amp;rsquo;re probably feeling a bit manic about the whole thing. It&amp;rsquo;s an itch that runs away laughing every time you try to scratch it. You probably haven&amp;rsquo;t bathed for the past 10,000 words. It&amp;rsquo;s so close, that line. If you&amp;rsquo;re on track, according to our recommendations, you should have about 45,900 words down right now. You are almost done.</description>

      <description>By far, the most-hyped comics release of the week is DK III: The Master Race, the third volume in Frank Millerâs Dark Knight series. Ostensibly co-written by Brian Azzarello, the actual authorship of DK III is in question â Frank Miller has basically admitted that heâs not been involved in the writing of the series. Whoever actually wrote the story, Miller certainly didnât draw the book; the art is by Andy Kubert, with inking by Dark Knight veteran Klaus Janson.</description>

      <description>It is as if we&amp;rsquo;re in competition to find the starkest horror. This world offers so many comers to the table, each one bloodier, more callous, more inhumane, more despicable than the rest. Some are small insults that strike us in a particular way. Some are grand vistas of despair that we cannot comprehend en masse, and are represented for us by a single photograph, say of a suffering child, as we read the news.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I told you about some local independent bookstores that you should visit on Small Business Saturday. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t buy books online, too! Below are three big sales from independent publishers just in time for Thanksgiving-weekend consumer madness. Buying directly from these publishers will help pay for more great new books in the coming year.
 On Monday, Seattle publisher Fantagraphics Books is having a 40% off sale on everything.</description>

      <description>Kristen Steenbeeke reports that Hugo House&amp;rsquo;s crowd-sourced poetry experiment has come to a close for the year. Last week, Hugo House set up a stand with a typewriter at the University District Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market and encouraged passers-by to contribute to a group poem. The poets were only allowed to write one line, and they were only allowed to read the line that came before their line.
Is the end result great poetry?</description>

      <description>The weeks leading up to Thanksgiving are traditionally when booksellers look back at the year that was and prepare for the busiest few weeks of the year. Danielle Hulton, the co-founder and manager of our November bookstore of the month, Adaâs Technical Books, is in that process right now, and she feels pretty good about where her store is.

âThis will be our third holidayâ in the storeâs new location on 15th Ave, she says, and âthe excitement that we felt from customers and from the neighborhood two years ago seems to have stayed.</description>

      <description>Dear Eve &amp;mdash;
The hardest part of being a writer is seeming natural. It&#39;s the same with actors: I was once in a commercial â an extra off to the side of one scene. The lead actress was doing improv, and when she turned to me and showed a crinkled nose of disgust and spit out some off-the-cuff line, I almost broke character because I thought she just blew the take and was mad at herself.</description>

      <description>I mentioned this in Your Week in Readings, but I thought it could use a little elaborating here: the Saturday after Thanksgiving is Small Business Saturday, when consumers are reminded to turn their backs on malls and chain stores and online retailers and visit the stores that help make their communities vibrant, interesting places to live.
Even better, local independent bookstores are celebrating Indies First, a program (invented by Sherman Alexie) in which authors work as booksellers at their favorite bookstores for a day.</description>

      <description>A bee flew about the living room, then another, and more. They began to lodge in the African masks that hung on the walls. They clung to my lip. My house is infested, I thought, and opened the door to the outside. Bees covered the doorâs lower half. I fled through it in fear, and in hope of finding help. In the living room, my father moved about with the bees, untroubled, unwilling to leave.</description>

      <description>The entire literary internet is currently exploding â in a good way, in a great way âÂ over &amp;ldquo;On Pandering,&amp;rdquo; an essay by Claire Vaye Watkins at Tin House. She tells a story about a male author behaving badly, she talks about the institutional gender bias of the publishing industry, she tears some preconceptions down to the studs and examines what&amp;rsquo;s left. It&amp;rsquo;s angry, funny, shocking, intelligent and, in the end, hopeful.</description>

Seats on 42nd Street subway Shuttle cars are [wrapped with symbols from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan](http://gothamist.com/2015/11/23/nazi_mta_subway_castle.php), intended to carry commuters into the alternate history of the Amazon TV series, *The Man in the High Castle*, in which the Axis Powers were victorious.
âHalf the seats in my car had Nazi insignias inside an American flag, while the other half had the Japanese flag in a style like the World War II design,â said straphanger Ann Toback.</description>

Between this and the new branch of Third Place Books in Seward Park that&amp;rsquo;s opening in early 2016, it&amp;rsquo;s time for the media to put away the tired &amp;ldquo;bookstores are dying&amp;rdquo; narrative for something newer, fresher, and more optimistic.</description>

      <description>We all owned one. My 1970s-era View-Master was red plastic with white trim, and the reels my parents bought for it tended towards the G-rated and Disneyified &amp;mdash; Cinderella, Bambi, maybe an occasional visitor from the Krofft Super Show. (Why were those other sea monsters so mean to Sigmund?)
But my sister, 18 years older than me and the mother of my three nieces, was a young stay-at-home mom on a limited budget who haunted garage sales like it was her job.</description>

If you ask nicely, she will probably tell you what wine goes best with turkey and stuffing.
TUESDAY At Town Hall Seattle, neuroscientist David Eagleman, who you most likely know from his PBS series about the brain, will be reading and discussing his new book The Brain: The Story of You, which aspires to âexplore why we think and feel the way we do, and how the brain shapes nearly every aspect of who we are and what we perceive as reality.</description>

      <description>Our sponsor Grey Sun Press has put out this wonderful collection, Joy to the Worlds: Mysterious Speculative Fiction for the Holidays. On our sponsor page, we have samples from four of the eight stories in the book. All from fanastic local writers: Maia Chance, Janine A. Southard, Raven Oak, and G. Clemens.
They&amp;rsquo;re going on a huge tour to celebrate this, starting with a house party on December 4th. And, if you&amp;rsquo;re a Santa Bot stuck on a webpage somewhere, they&amp;rsquo;ll be doing a Google+ event on December 5th, a Reddit AMA on December 18th, and in between, in the real world, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a chance to see the group in Bellevue (12&amp;frasl;6), Beaverton (12&amp;frasl;11), Seattle (12&amp;frasl;12), or Tacoma (12&amp;frasl;13).</description>

      <description>Jennifer de Guzman at Comics Alliance published an illuminating report on the high cost of drawing comics:
Being a comic book artist is a physically taxing job. Long hours sitting at the literal drawing board (whether drawing on paper or digitally) can strain muscles in the back, neck, and shoulders; repetitive motions inflame tendons in the arms. Combine this demanding work with the life of a freelancer, which, in the United States, does not come with any form of health care, and youâll realize that many comics artists are living one injury away from economic disaster.</description>

      <description>How&amp;rsquo;s your word count this week? If you&amp;rsquo;re on track, you&amp;rsquo;re at about 34,000 words. Get in extra this weekend to allow for padding over Thanksgiving (if you&amp;rsquo;re American) because you deserve a day with family, food, and gratitude.
If you&amp;rsquo;re behind, I still urge you not to despair. You are learning about yourself, and about your story, and you are writing more than you were before November, right? We are stepping on the right path.</description>

**My son hates to read. The rest of the family? That&#39;s all we do. We don&#39;t have a TV, even. The other five of us could pass every moment of every day with our noses in a book, but our son wouldn&#39;t read chocolate if it were a book.</description>

      <description>In what could very possibly be some sort of a record, Marvel Comics this week published three first issues of three different series starring superheroes who are women. Even better, all three of them are great fun. Theyâre classic superhero comics; compelling stories about conflicted characters in outlandish situations.
The Mighty Thor #1 establishes the new status quo for the title: Jane Foster, the character best-known as Thorâs mortal girlfriend in the film series, controls the hammer (and the power) of Thor.</description>

YOUNG PEOPLEâS LITERATURE Neal Shusterman, Challenger Deep
POETRY Robin Coste Lewis, Voyage of the Sable Venus
FICTION Adam Johnson, Fortune Smiles
NONFICTION Ta-Nehisi Coates, Between the World and Me
Of course people have opinions about which books should have won. A lot of folks were pulling for Noelle Stevenson to win the young adult award with her comic Nimona, for instance.</description>

Isis Books &amp;amp; Gifts has been vandalized five times in the last year, presumably because of, as Isis owner John Harrison told the Associated Press, &amp;ldquo;some ignorant people believing that somehow the terrorists have a store, a gift store, in the middle of Denver, Colorado.</description>

Yesterday, Seattle&amp;rsquo;s own Fantagraphics Books formally announced Patience, the new graphic novel by Dan Clowes. It&amp;rsquo;s the biggest original comic he&amp;rsquo;s ever produced, and the description sounds fantastic:
*Patience* is an indescribable psychedelic science-fiction love story, veering with uncanny precision from violent destruction to deeply personal tenderness in a way that is both quintessentially âClowesian,â and utterly unique in the authorâs body of work. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a Clowes fan, but I think his best work skims the surface of genre â Ice Haven was a cross-disciplinary mystery novel, The Death Ray was a superhero comic riff.</description>

      <description>Anyone looking at a copy of Benjamin Marraâs Terror Assaulter: OMWOT (One Man War on Terror) is forced to do some heavy categorizing. The cover features a guy in a suit, wearing sunglasses, and smoking a cigarette beheading a bad guy with a katana. The bad guy is armed with a gun and a chainsaw, built like the proverbial brick shithouse, and is dressed like an old He-Man figure: blue briefs and a belt, frilly boots, and a little cape.</description>

      <description>The December issue of *Details* magazine will be its last, making the menâs fashion title the latest casualty of the declining print advertising market. While I&amp;rsquo;m not going to shed a tear for Details â I haven&amp;rsquo;t read a copy in at least a decade â this is not good news for writers. It&amp;rsquo;s hard out there for freelancers, and only getting harder. Combine this with news that Gawker laid off writers yesterday in their ill-advised attempt to rebrand as a politics site and you&amp;rsquo;ve got another step forward in the consolidation of an already-rough market.</description>

      <description>Ask Steve Winter how long heâs been in the bookselling business and heâll tell you, âIâve been saying 22 years for a couple years.â After a few short stints at bookstores in his native Michigan, Winter moved to Seattle and worked at Elliott Bay Book Company for ten years (where, full disclosure, he and I were coworkers) and at Third Place Books for eight years.
For the last two years, Winter has worked at Adaâs Technical Books for Adaâs co-owner Danielle Hulton, who claims less than a quarter of his bookselling experience.</description>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1447750392266/UK-Quad-Mono-72dpi.jpg)
James Bond films have never hewed too closely to Ian Flemingâs novels. Even the movies based directly on Flemingâs books, like Goldfinger, take many liberties with the plot and tone of the novels. This is perfectly fine; a movie is a movie and a book is a book. Bond films have developed their own language over the course of 50 years; theyâre as distinct and self-referential as any film series in cinematic history.</description>

      <description>Some people would argue that forbidden love stories are the only love stories worth telling. The people who would argue that are probably not the kind of people you should date. Sure, a love story can be compelling if parents or society or circumstances deny the lovers from their right to be happy. But not every transgression is a welcome one, and not every love story is innocent.
The titular narrator of Jennifer Tsengâs novel Mayumi and the Sea of Happiness believes that she is in love, and she believes passionately in the love story sheâs telling.</description>

      <description>They felt the wind on the down of their necks.
After the murders, children in the town dreamed of houses
melting into the sky.
Fear built its hive inside them.
But as they grew
their memories dwindled
like their bicycles that became too small to ride.
The graves
lay buried beneath the treesâ
shadows. Parents split
and moved away. One sister
survived. One witnessed the dark ceiling
of every midnight</description>

      <description>You may or may not be ready for the holidays, but it&amp;rsquo;s never the wrong time to read a great collection of themed stories. This week&amp;rsquo;s sponsor Grey Sun Press offers just that with Joy to the Worlds: Mysterious Speculative Fiction for the Holidays.
It&amp;rsquo;s a season&amp;rsquo;s worth of cross-genre stories revolving around the legends and trappings of the Winter season holidays, by four accomplished local writers: Maia Chance, Janine A.</description>

      <description>Last night, I had the pleasure of introducing David Sedaris at a sold-out reading at Benaroya Hall. This is the seventh time I&#39;ve introduced Sedaris, and it&#39;s always a thrill. The best part of introducing David Sedaris is you get to hear him read after the introduction is done; he&#39;s simply the best reader I&#39;ve ever seen. He&#39;ll be back in town next year on November 16th; I&#39;ll let you know when tickets go on sale.</description>

      <description>MONDAY Lyndon Johnson is perhaps the modern president who most lends himself to literary works. Heâs appeared in Robert Caroâs ridiculously ambitious biographies, one of David Foster Wallaceâs best short stories, and Robert Schenkkanâs incredible plays. But tonight, Betty Boyd Caroli looks at an under-appreciated side of the LBJ story in her book Lady Bird and Lyndon. Lady Bird Johnson could not have been a dull or unintelligent woman, but sheâs gotten short shrift in most of the above-mentioned literary accounts.</description>

      <description>[Terror Strikes in Paris](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/terror-strikes-in-paris) Only one story today about Paris, because that is about all I can bear. But reactions that are neither hot nor takes, but explorations of deeply felt frustrations, help me to process the horror of Friday evening. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to rely on Adam Gopnik&amp;rsquo;s measured approach to tragedy, and his ever-apparent frustration with the violence he writes about for the New Yorker.
 Terrorism of this nihilistic order is hardly unknown in Paris.</description>

      <description>Every day, friend of the SRoB Rahawa Haile tweets a short story. She gave us permission to collect them every week. She&#39;s archiving the entire project on Storify
This week, Rahawa appeared, reading some of her own stories, on the Catapult podcast. You should spend some time there, so that when you read these posts on Saturdays, you&amp;rsquo;ll hear Rahawa&amp;rsquo;s voice when you read her tweets.

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re doing your job, and are on target, by Sunday you&amp;rsquo;ll be at a magic place: halfway. Oh my, how good it feels to cross that 25,000 word line. Some of you have already flown past it, so know the feeling.
Some of you probably feel like you&amp;rsquo;ll never reach it and the whole thing is hopeless. It&amp;rsquo;s not. If you&amp;rsquo;ve written 10,000 words this whole month, you&amp;rsquo;re 10,000 words into a novel that didn&amp;rsquo;t exist on Halloween.</description>

      <description>Very sad news: we&amp;rsquo;ve received word from her literary executor that Madeline DeFrees, a Seattle poet, passed away last night. She would have been 96 years old next week.
DeFrees was widely celebrated, including a Guggenheim Fellowship in Poetry and two Washington State Book Awards. Her most recent collections were published with Copper Canyon Press. According to her website, DeFrees &amp;ldquo;spent 38 years as a nun with the Catholic Congregation of Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary.</description>

      <description>If you were watching NBC News last week you have may have noticed a segment about the Amazon bookstore opening in Seattle. In that clip, you may have seen our own Paul Constant giving his (our, really) opinion on the matter.
But we didnât know until today (despite nice friends letting us know) that the video played on national NBC News, not just King5. Today we uncovered the video in question, and are offering it for you here, in the least timely way possible, so that you, like us, can cheer when you see our website appear on that master of all media, big television.</description>

      <description>When you edit a book titled The Best American Comics 2015, you are almost certainly setting yourself up for failure. Surely Jonathan Lethem knew this when he signed on for the job. Worse yet, when he agreed to be the editor of the 2015 edition of The Best American Comics, he must have known he was immediately following Scott McCloudâs entry in the series, which is by far the best Best American Comics to ever see publication.</description>

      <description>World Fantasy Award organizers recently announced that they would stop giving out busts of infamous racist H.P. Lovecraft to winners. Lovecraft biographer S.T. Joshi is outraged, calling the decision âa craven yielding to the worst sort of political correctness.â Joshi has returned his World Fantasy Awards in protest, The Guardian reports.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to draw a distinction between banning the works of Lovecraft âÂ which nobody is demanding, for the record â and literally idolizing him with a statue.</description>

      <description>The nerd internet got very excited a few weeks ago when the first trailer for the Preacher TV series was posted to YouTube. The trailer, to me, looked like a lot of hand-waving with very little substance, but then Iâve got conflicted feelings about Preacher. When I was a teenager, it was my favorite comic, a huge epic story â letâs be honest, a superhero story â about good and evil and, most importantly, sacrilege.</description>

The thing is, Miller&amp;rsquo;s article didn&amp;rsquo;t cover the best part: the angry white man who tried to get the woman to stop reading and pay attention to Donald Trump, who was, at that exact moment, talking about how much sleep he gets every night.</description>

      <description>Part of the mission statement for the Seattle Review of Books is to keep the art of the book review alive for another generation. Too many review outlets subscribe to the notion that a book review is just a plot synopsis with a little bit of thumbs-up or thumbs-down commentary stapled onto the end. We think book reviews are unique pieces of art; they are criticism written in the form they&amp;rsquo;re critiquing.</description>

John Paul DeGennaro started working at Adaâs Technical Books about a year and a half ago. He had just moved back to Seattle after graduating from the University of New Hampshire as an anthropology major. He says heâd never worked in a bookstore before, though heâd always wanted to, because it appealed to his interests in science and education.
Earlier this month, DeGennaro became Adaâs new events coordinator. So what does he think makes for a great event?</description>

      <description>From Jessica Roy at The Cut, a horrific lede:
A British man used social media to stalk a teen in Scotland, then traveled 500 miles to the grocery store where she worked and smashed her over the head with a wine bottle, all because she gave his self-published book a bad review. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s time to briefly go over the rules of engagement for authors?
 Be gracious and brief when you receive praise on social media.</description>

      <description>Memoirs are sometimes too much for me to handle, but I can read autobiographical comics all day, every day. So whatâs the difference? Ultimately, itâs a matter of scale. You have to suspend a whole lot of belief to cozy up to the idea that a human beingâs life coheres exactly to something resembling a narrative arc with a beginning, a middle, and an end â especially when itâs got a pat little moral plugged into the core of the thing.</description>

      <description>Remember the time you watched your uncle
prepare to enter the woods to hunt? The uncle
hunted with a bow and arrow, he greased
his boots for waterproofing, he wore
a brilliant poppy for a hat. You did not go
to see the breath billow from the mouth
of the uncle past the brush of the brown moustache, or pause when he paused, knee raised, knuckles
loose, ears prickling. You stayed at home and hoped for the deer and the uncle to miss each other, to dance in different parts of the woods, you didn&amp;rsquo;t know how hunting worked.</description>

      <description>Our sponsor this week, Donald Kentop, became fascinated with the Triangle Factory Fire, after learning that the building where the tragedy happened still stands as the Asch Building. It&amp;rsquo;s part of New York University, and Kentop had classes in the building when he was a student.
He has woven a deep history of the fire, told in verse, through the stories of survivors, victims, and the unfolding of the event itself, in his book Frozen by Fire.</description>

Amazon.com has come a long way. Theyâve been in business for two decades now, moving billions of dollars of merchandise around the world, harvesting untold amounts of information from their customer transactions and searches, collecting tens of billions of pages worth of customer reviews on products, and investing tens of millions of employee work-hours into tightening the gap between customer desire and customer satisfaction. In many ways, the culmination of what Amazon sought to do with all that data is now made physical, in the form of a brick-and-mortar store, Amazon Books, in a University Village storefront formerly occupied by a conveyer-belt sushi restaurant.</description>

      <description>MONDAY Garth Risk Hallberg reads from his enormous, buzzy debut novel City on Fire at Elliott Bay Book Company. I havenât read this one yet â every season seemingly brings with it a Big Ambitious Novel By a Young White Guy, and itâs very hard to tell which of them really matter. (The last one of these big novels, Joshua Cohenâs The Book of Numbers, was widely celebrated as a success on its release this spring, but most people I know whoâve read it call it a bust.</description>

      <description>[The Fort of Young Saplings](https://read.atavist.com/the-fort-of-young-saplings?no-overlay&amp;preview) Settle in, folks. This one will take a bit of your time, but I promise you won&amp;rsquo;t regret it. Oregon (and ex-Seattle) writer Vanessa Veselka goes deep on her personal connection to a clan of Tlingit people in Alaska, and using that connection explores the history, legends, and relationships with Russians, of this Alaskan indigenous people. A stunning piece of writing.
 The Tlingit donât fit stereotypes of Native Americans.</description>

Reward for the 1st person who takes a photo of themselves buying from an indie bookstore on their phone while standing in an Amazon Books.
&amp;mdash; Paul Constant (@paulconstant) November 3, 2015 If you were unaware, Amazon has actively promoted &amp;ldquo;showrooming,&amp;rdquo; which is the act of standing in a brick-and-mortar bookstore, looking at a book, and then buying it on Amazon, rather than from the bookstore.</description>

Two Sylvias, of course, was founded by Kelli Russell Agodon, who was the very first poet we published here at the Seattle Review of Books.</description>

      <description>So, how&amp;rsquo;s progress? If you&amp;rsquo;re on track, and getting your nut in every day, you should be about 10,000 words today. If you&amp;rsquo;ve cracked that milestone â congratulations! That&amp;rsquo;s huge. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t, don&amp;rsquo;t despair. Buckle down over the weekend and get some hours in. This is the time to make it happen. Your book can&amp;rsquo;t be read until you&amp;rsquo;ve written it.
Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to cover the sine wave that is a writer&amp;rsquo;s mood when penning a novel.</description>

**Dear Cienna,**
I can&amp;rsquo;t remember if my anger and frustration with Amazon began when I heard about the &amp;ldquo;gazelle&amp;rdquo; project, or when I heard about their total lack of philanthropic investment in our city, or what, but by the time the Hachette e-book price wars started up, my rage had reached a boiling point, and with the opening of their stupid bookstore, I am just seething.</description>

      <description>The Associated Press says:
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) â Chile&#39;s government is acknowledging that Nobel-prize winning poet Pablo Neruda might have been killed after the 1973 coup that brought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to power.
The Interior Ministry released a statement Thursday amid press reports that Neruda might not have died of cancer.
 The statement, in fact, says it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;clearly possible and highly probable&amp;rdquo; that the poet was murdered. Hopefully, at least, morbid curiosity will drive new fans to Neruda&amp;rsquo;s work.</description>

Ari Berman, who was kind enough to do an Election Day interview with us, will read from Give Us the Ballot, his compelling history of the struggle for voting rights in America. Berman will also be in conversation with Washington state Supreme Court Justice Steven Gonzalez about local results and what we can do to increase voter turnout here.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s almost time for holiday shopping. But before we get down to the arduousness of âÂ ugh â buying books for other people, you should visit Third Place Books and Third Place Books Ravenna this weekend. On Saturday and Sunday, all used books in both locations are 40 percent off. It&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite book sales of the year, and a great chance to get some selfish book-buying done before it&amp;rsquo;s time to start thinking of other people again.</description>

      <description>Has anyone yet written a how-to-write book for how-to-write books? If it hasnât happened yet, weâre probably closing in on that moment in literary history. Lots of people âÂ myself included âenjoy being hypnotized by the soothing rhythm and encouraging cadence of how-to-write guides. After a certain point, all the tips and tricks and affirming quotations blend together into a whirl of positivity, but a good writing guide stands out: Stephen Kingâs On Writing is one, and Anne Lamottâs Bird by Bird, and John Gardnerâs The Art of Fiction, and Natalie Goldbergâs Writing Down the Bones.</description>

I can&amp;rsquo;t shut up about how good Saga is; he recently wrapped up The Private Eye, a beautiful sci-fi comic with Marcos Martin; his Canadian future war comic We Stand On Guard keeps getting better; and his newest series, the retro sci-fi adventure comic Paper Girls, is probably his best non-Saga comics work yet. Co-created with artist Cliff Chiang, Paper Girls tells the story of a group of newspaper delivery girls in 1988.</description>

      <description>Burglars stole nearly a thousand dollars from the delightful Couth Buzzard Books on Greenwood Ave over the weekend, reports Phinneywood.com.

      <description>Yesterday saw an avalanche of think-pieces and first-person accounts of the launch day for Amazon Books, the online retailer&amp;rsquo;s first physical bookstore in University Village. The most notorious of these hot takes was Megan Garber&amp;rsquo;s piece for the Atlantic, titled &amp;ldquo;Did Amazon Just Replace the Public Library?&amp;rdquo; I honestly can&amp;rsquo;t tell if Garber&amp;rsquo;s piece is supposed to be a joke or a troll or not.

Danielle and David Hulton didnât know anything about running a bookstore when they founded Adaâs Technical Books five years ago. Thatâs probably for the best â the bookselling industry has been dying for at least four decades, according to the bookselling industry. Experienced booksellers tend to get so mired in gloom and doom that theyâd likely never get around to opening a new bookstore. Sometimes it takes a novice to get it right.</description>

You&amp;rsquo;ve hopefully already read Paul&amp;rsquo;s definitive guide to the Short Run Comix and Arts Festival, but I wanted to share what my more personal experience of what the day was like.
I was with my five year-old, who was pretty excited as soon as he figured out that he could trick &amp;lsquo;r treat at most of the tables, so long as they showed a little pink indicator sign. This was ingenious, so thank you to all of the tables that participated.</description>

      <title>Voting is power: A conversation with Ari Berman about the struggle for voting rights in America</title>

      <description>The Nation contributing writer Ari Bermanâs excellent new book Give Us the Ballot tracks the history of voting rights in America from the 1950s to today. No less a civil rights giant than Congressman John Lewis calls Bermanâs history a âmust-readâ that âshould become a primer for every Americanâ on the topic of voting equality. (Lewis, of course, figures heavily into *Ballot*âs narrative.) This Friday, Berman appears in conversation with Supreme Court Justice Steven Gonzalez at Town Hall to talk about the state of voting rights nationally and in Washington State.</description>

      <description>right off &amp;mdash; thereâs already enough rain
Iâm not inviting it into my poetry
salmonâthis fish whose body
torques up ladders &amp;mdash;
has enough problems
if youâre Cuban
and wind up in the Pacific Northwest &amp;mdash; the ecstasy of your dreams is pocketed until August &amp;mdash; the only month of certain heat
you troll the Asian produce stands
for malanga, scotch bonnet peppers,
and the elusive green plantain
you wait months for the only Desi Arnaz CD in the Seattle Public Libraryâs holdings &amp;mdash; even though there arenât any other holds</description>

      <description>Looks like Amazon gave the Seattle Times the exclusive. Jay Greene reports:
At 9:30 Tuesday morning, the online retail giant will open will open [sic] its first-ever brick-and-mortar retail store in its 20-year life in University Village.
The store, called Amazon Books, looks a lot like bookstores that populate malls across the country. Its wood shelves are stocked with 5,000 to 6,000 titles, best-sellers as well as Amazon.com customer favorites.</description>

      <description>In this morning&amp;rsquo;s post, I said there were way too many great events going on this week. I stand by that statement. Somehow, it escaped my attention that Seattle Arts and Lectures is hosting a Local Voices reading tomorrow night at Hugo House. No offense to Marion Nestle, who will undoubtedly put on a great reading at Town Hall tomorrow night and who is very knowledgeable about the scourge that is Big Soda, but the Local Voices reading should obviously have been the event of the night.</description>

      <description>Our thanks to this week&amp;rsquo;s sponsor Entre RÃ­os Books. Their first release Twelve Saints is a beautifully done collaboration between poet Knox Gardner and artist Nia Michaels.
On our sponsor page, we&amp;rsquo;re featuring the &amp;ldquo;Saint Catherine of Alexandria&amp;rdquo; with her matching image. It&amp;rsquo;s a real treat, and we think you&amp;rsquo;re going to love it.
They&amp;rsquo;re throwing a book release party this Thursday &amp;mdash; look at the sponsor page for more information.</description>

Conventions are strange. We find them appealing because theyâre momentary â they exist for a day, or a weekend, and then theyâre gone. But we also become attached to specific conventions; we get used to the rhythms and organizational themes, and we get upset when we feel that a convention has âbetrayedâ its original voice. So we expect conventions to be transitory, but we also demand consistency from convention organizers.</description>

If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t grab your attention, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what will. Kleine will be appearing with delightful Seattle author Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore, who will read new work.

They&amp;rsquo;re mostly harmless, and get people in the door and engaging on the platform. But Jay Greene | Twitter&amp;rdquo;) at the Seattle Times looks at the darker of review activism.
Increasingly, though, people are launching coordinated campaigns to push political and social agendas through negative reviews often only tangentially related to the product for sale.</description>

      <description>Our thanks to this week&amp;rsquo;s sponsor Esther Altshul Helfgott. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to look through the excerpt from her book Dear Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s, you should do so now &amp;mdash; it will only be up through tomorrow.
Helgott&amp;rsquo;s journal of poetry and prose turned poignant when her husband Abe started feeling the effects of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s. Her light touch, observational manner, and careful writing make this a moving journey. One full of life and discovery, despite the seriousness of the topic.</description>

This is a collaborative poem what will perhaps result in something ghastly. Who or what is being exorcised from whom? Unclear! Presumably all will be revealed tomorrow.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Gay-romance novelist accused of plagiarizing straight-romance novelist.&amp;rdquo; I mention this story in part because plagiarism is always fascinating â in part because it&amp;rsquo;s always unnecessary. Why steal someone else&amp;rsquo;s words when there are all these free words floating around our heads all day?
But this story is especially interesting: who was the person who reads both straight and gay romance who uncovered this plagiarism in the first place? I know they exist, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s great, but what is the reading process like?</description>

I have a nasty secret. I really like to pretend I&amp;rsquo;ve read books that I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually read. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll be at a party and someone will start talking to me about â here&amp;rsquo;s a recent example â Gore Vidal.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow, the Short Run Comix &amp;amp; Arts Festival will be happening at the Fisher Pavillion at Seattle Center from 11 am to 6 pm. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a ridiculously long list of all the exhibitors at the show, you can find that here. But the best way to go to Short Run is to not have a plan. Bring some cash and walk around. If you see something you like, buy it.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, Facebook made news with some gossip that the site was trying to find a more nuanced way to respond to posts than simply âLikingâ everything. The thinking, supposedly, was that it is inappropriate to âLikeâ a post announcing a loved oneâs death, and people would prefer some other wordless way to show support. This was presented in the media as a novel problem, one created by the relatively new innovation that is Facebook.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve had record traffic with our library coverage &amp;mdash; you could reach out to that crowd to tell them about your book or event. People are starting to rely on the Seattle Review of Books for literary coverage; your sponsorship would help make that possible.
How&amp;rsquo;s the sponsorship model going so far? Really well! Out of 27 original weeks we opened in this block of availability, only 5 are left.</description>

      <description>As I noted in my Week in Readings post on Monday, Ta-Nehisi Coates reads from his new book, Between the World and Me, tonight as part of the 2015-2016 Seattle Arts &amp;amp; Lectures season. The reading is long since sold out; if you don&amp;rsquo;t have tickets already, you are out of luck.
But allow me to take this opportunity to tell you something: if you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet read Coates&amp;rsquo;s book Between the World and Me, you are missing out on the most important book of the year.</description>

      <description>The first issue of Art Ops, a new comic by Shaun Simon and Mike Allred, contains one indelible image: Mona Lisa, shopping in a contemporary grocery store. Sheâs wearing a bright yellow hoodie, and sheâs buying cans of soupÂ â Campbellâs soup, of course, an obvious shout-out to Andy Warhol, who has a cameo elsewhere in the issue. The young man running the checkout counter screws up the nerves to ask her out: âSo, Lisa, I was wondering if youâ¦if you wanted to catch a movie or something.</description>

      <description>In an unusually well-attended board meeting Wednesday evening, the Library Board of Trustees voted unanimously to halt implementation of the proposed logo and name change last night. This stops the proposed implementation of the brand and name change, which would have cost $570,000 over the next two years. However, it was unclear â both to the audience, and it seemed to the board itself â what exactly the implications of this vote might be on the work already generated by the rebranding process.</description>

The quote was from a letter dated October 14, 2015 &amp;dash; so, clearly a response to the lack of public support from the survey.

Established and emerging artists working in any discipline or genre may apply to any one of the residency programs offered. Artists living outside of the Puget Sound region may apply, but should be aware that expenses for travel, lodging, etc.</description>

      <description>Had she lived, Sylvia Plath would have been 83 years old today. If you&amp;rsquo;re in the mood, maybe stop by this Brainpickings post and listen to Plath share her thoughts on poetry. As for me, it&amp;rsquo;s a sad occasion; I tend to spend the day thinking about all the work that never made it to the page.
If Plath&amp;rsquo;s birthday reminds you of all the great writing by women that the world never got to read, I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to pick up Kate Zambreno&amp;rsquo;s excellent book Heroines, which serves as a celebration of (and lament for) all the women of literature who have been forgotten, or undervalued, or unrecognized.</description>

      <description>Rushing toward the ocean tongue
Along the lip of land
I am what my friends feared
Grit traded in for grains of sand
My city soil scattered in Northwest winds
Twice despised for behavior unbecoming&amp;mdash;
Unable to leave the cascade light
Unwilling to claim the shadowed coo of pigeonâs songs as my only note.</description>

      <description>Busy day here, at the Seattle Review of Books. First, we published a piece by Laurel Holliday, Library Board scrambles for special meeting on rebranding issue; City Hall reacts, looking at the board&amp;rsquo;s apparent cold-feet over the rebranding effort.
Then, we talked to the man behind the rebranding effort himself, City Librarian Marcellus Turner, and made sure that he had a chance to defend his work, in his own words (which, to our ears, read like little more than corporate-esque non-speak).</description>

      <title>An open letter to the Seattle Public Library Board of Trustees about SPLâs âanti-bookâ agenda</title>

      <description>President Fujiwara and the Seattle Public Libraryâs Board of Trustees,
As Laurel Holliday reported for the Seattle Review of Books last week, public response to Seattle Public Libraryâs proposed rebranding campaign has been overwhelmingly negative. In fact, Holliday reports the response has been so negative that the board appears likely to kill the rebranding plan at or before their public meeting on Wednesday.
This is for the best. The rebranding was ill-considered, and it was presented to the public in an arrogant, unprofessional way.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re sponsored this week by a very unique book, by a very unique Seattle writer. Esther Altshul Helfgott kept a journal full of insight and poetry, as Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s first showed its affects in her husband Abe. Her book Dear Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s is a startling, humane, and insightful look into a difficult time.
You may know Helfgott from her long standing (25 years!) writers reading series It&amp;rsquo;s About Time, held every second Thursday at the Seattle Public Library&amp;rsquo;s Ballard Branch.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday, October 21, I conducted an email interview with Marcellus Turner (interlocuted by SPL Communications Director Andra Addison), and I asked him three questions about the rebranding effort.
**Who first proposed rebranding SPL? Why did you come out so strongly in favor of rebranding rather than some other means of obtaining your ends?**
I know that once I arrived at The Seattle Public Library, I recognized some areas that needed review, our look and brand being one of them.</description>

      <description>_Update: 10:57am. Following the post is an email update from Seattle Public Library&#39;s Director of Communications, Andra Addison_.
The Seattle Public Library Board of Trustees appears to be responding proactively to the barrage of criticism the SPL rebranding initiative has received from patrons, the public, library donors, and the media over the course of the last month. Board members have called for a Special Meeting to vote on the rebranding initiative before their Wednesday, October 28th regularly scheduled meeting which has the branding initiative on the agenda.</description>

      <description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re dedicating the Seattle Review of Books to the Seattle Public Library, and City Librarian Marcellus Turner&amp;rsquo;s proposed re-branding. We even published Paul&amp;rsquo;s normal Monday Week in Readings post last night, to keep our focus.
We&amp;rsquo;re publishing three pieces today on the topic:
At 10:00am Laurel Holliday, who [previously covered the public response](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/21/public-response-to-spl-survey-sharply-against-city-librarian-marcellus-turners-rebranding-plan/ &#34;The Seattle Review of Books - Public response to SPL survey sharply against City Librarian Marcellus Turner&amp;#39;s rebranding plan&#34;</description>

Press materials promise that Johnson will discuss âhow we can use space resources to help solve energy and environmental problems on Earth while simultaneously putting in place the infrastructure to allow sustained exploration of Mars.â Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve seen The Martian and you&amp;rsquo;re all stressed about what would happen if you get trapped on Mars by yourself, you should probably start preparing for just that eventuality.</description>

 Doug gets an unkind review. We are worried. Will one of us dopily bring it up in workshop? We donât. Doug does. Right off the bat. He wants to talk about it, because he feels there might be something in it for us. The talk he gives us is beautiful, honest, courageous, totally generous.</description>

Sinisalo is truly remarkable &amp;mdash; a writer of the strange and wonderful. Modern spec fic fans will love her work, and her travelling to Seattle from her home in Finland is a rare occasion worth celebrating.</description>

      <description>Seattle poet (and Seattle Review of Books contributor) Anastacia Renee Tolbert read as part of the Furnace Reading Series at Hollow Earth Radio earlier this month. She told a story featuring the city of Seattle as a protagonist. Now that reading is available online for free. If you&amp;rsquo;ve only ever experienced Tolbert&amp;rsquo;s writing in print form, you&amp;rsquo;re in for a real treat; her spoken word performances are absolutely riveting, and she can turn a room into a party, or a funeral, or church, just with just a few well-placed syllables.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Slate published this amazing interactive annotated edition of Bartleby, the Scrivener. I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of all of Melville&amp;rsquo;s writing, but Bartleby becomes more relevant with each passing year. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful American myth, and when viewed from another angle it can be read as kind of a forerunner to Office Space and The Office and other comedies about the drudgery of middle management.</description>

If you began your Lit Crawl last night at the reading sponsored by Seattle-based literary magazine The James Franco Review, the first thing you heard was a poem by Lena Khalaf Tuffaha that includes this line: âHere, our senses are overwhelmed.â Thatâs about the most appropriate invocation the evening couldâve asked for.
Lit Crawl is an event that is by definition overwhelming. Youâre given way too many options to choose fromâ almost a hundred readers, spread all over Capitol and First Hill â and audiences spend the night chasing readings around town.</description>

      <description>Maybe I was just in a bad mood or something, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t find much enjoyment in the comics I bought yesterday. The new issue of Godzilla in Hell is a total bust â a real downer of a serious, clunky monster comic after last issueâs greatness. The 28th issue of Astro City continues a depressing trend with that series; what began as commentary on superheroes has basically become a boring superhero anthology comic.</description>

      <description>Over 14,000 people recently took a Seattle Public Library survey about a &amp;ldquo;branding initiative&amp;rdquo; that would change the face of the library and cost well over a million dollars, according to SPL Communications Director Andra Addison. Advised by heavy-hitter Hornall Anderson, City Librarian Marcellus Turner is spearheading a campaign to rename the library and replace its familiar logo, all in an effort to more clearly project the image described in this &amp;ldquo;brand statement&amp;rdquo;:</description>

      <title>Itâs the seventh annual National Day on Writing</title>

      <description>Every October 20th a coalition of partners like the New York Times, the National Writing Project, the National Council of Teachers of English, and the Teaching Channel come together to encourage writing. They want you to hashtag: #WhyIWrite.
I even did one of my own:
#WhyIWrite Because figuring out how I feel about something requires five or so years and 80,000 or so words.
&amp;mdash; Martin McClellan (@hellbox) October 20, 2015 The whole thing was inspired by Orwellâs famous essay, whose title inspired the hashtag.</description>

      <title>Lit Crawl itinerary #7: It&#39;s all true</title>

      <description>On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here&#39;s our seventh suggested itinerary:
All of the readings on this itinerary feature true, honest-to-God, not-made-up stories.
1. At Town Hall to start out the night, memoirists Sarah Hepola (Blackout) and Melissa Febos (Whip Smart) will read from their stories of sobriety and recovery.</description>

      <description>The title novella in Colum McCannâs new collection Thirteen Ways of Looking is a mystery, but itâs less of a whodunnit and more of a howâd-it-happen. Our protagonist, a former New York state Supreme Court judge named Peter Mendelssohn, is elderly and infirm. His wife, Eileen, has died. His son, Elliot, is a disappointment. Mendelssohn spends all morning in bed, thinking of the life he lived. Heâs not overcome with regret, although he desperately hates the adult diaper that his nurse, an immigrant named Sally, makes him wear.</description>

      <description>This is welcome news: &amp;ldquo;New York Review Books is pleased to announce New York Review Comics, a new series of books at the union of art and literature.&amp;rdquo; They&amp;rsquo;re going to present work that has never been translated into English, as well as revivals of work by cartoonists Mark Beyer and Glen Baxter. Always good to see literary comics get some love; Fantagraphics can&amp;rsquo;t do all this work by themselves.</description>

      <description>![Shin Yu Pai, reading at her *HEIRLOOM* exhibit in Carkeek Park earlier this year.](/webhook-uploads/1445203007597/Shin%20Yu%20Pai.jpg)
Shin Yu Pai is one of the smartest, most intellectually curious poets in the region. Her projects are always ambitious, and they string together multiple perspectives and interests âÂ history, media, art, site-specificity â to create something new. So the news that sheâs been [named the Redmond Poet Laureate](http://www.redmond.gov/cms/one.aspx?objectId=6983) is especially exciting. Paiâs poetry has incorporated family history and photography and even botany to tell a new kind of story through poetry; sheâs exactly the kind of poet you want to represent a city, because she is capable of thinking about all the different levels of what it means to be a city.</description>

      <description>As we have noted repeatedly, this Thursday is Lit Crawl Seattle. But it&amp;rsquo;s also important to note that Alison Bechdel will be reading at Town Hall in a sold-out edition of the 2015-2016 Seattle Arts and Lectures reading series. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet read Bechdel&amp;rsquo;s Fun Home or Dykes to Watch Out For, this excellent essay by Seattle writer Corinne Manning at Literary Hub explains her particular genius.</description>

      <description>Iâve worn them once
my wedding shoes
dyed red, more and yes red
the way a strike against
the tip of a match ignites
and pomegranate rubies
stain a thousand secrets worth
Adam did not fall for jewels
but for the juice of a fruit
like the crimson Fujis I harvest
each fall from my backyard tree
when rusty leaves layer the ground</description>

      <title>The Invisible Art of Magazines</title>

      <guid>http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-invisible-art-of-magazines/</guid>
      <description>Magazines fill a very particular literary void. We read novels for their depth and substance, we read comics to be dazzled, we read poetry collections to be immersed in the brain of a person who sees the world differently than we do. But we read magazines when we want to hear a chorus of voices, when we want to travel, when we need to filter a large expanse of the world through a singular organizational perspective.</description>

      <description>We love titles that tell you what you&amp;rsquo;re in for (look at ours!). This week&amp;rsquo;s sponsor G.G. Silverman hit the nail on the head with her book Vegan Teenage Zombie Huntress. The first two chapters , which we published on our sponsorships page, left us wanting more â and we think you&amp;rsquo;ll love them too. Give it a read.
We are sponsored by independent writers and publishers who, with us, want to make internet advertising 100 percent less terrible.</description>

For as long as Seattle has been a city, people have come to town and people have left town. Earlier this year, the *Seattle Review of Books* introduced a feature called [Exit Interview](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/exit-interview-talking-with-kate-lebo-about-why-she-left-seattle-for-spokane/), in which we talk with [an author who recently left town](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/09/exit-interview-kelly-davio-is-moving-to-london/) about their Seattle experience. The natural pair to that feature is New Hire, an interview with an author whoâs just arrived here. (If you have any suggestions for a subject of an upcoming Exit Interview or a New Hire, please [drop us a line](http://seattlereviewofbooks.</description>

      <description>MONDAY Start the week off with some librarians at a Bookish Happy Hour at the Diller Room. This is part of Seattle Public Libraryâs Booktoberfest program, which brings librarians, beer, and you together in non-traditional venues.
TUESDAY Iâve been looking forward to this for months now: at the Seattle Public Library, Iâm participating in an event with Colum McCann and John Freeman. McCann, of course, is a beloved novelist who manages to span that widest of chasms: he writes â gasp!</description>

      <description>[Pond Scum: Henry David Thoreauâs moral myopia.](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum &#34;Why Do We Love Henry David Thoreau? - The New Yorker&#34;) Oh, how I love Kathryn Schulz&amp;rsquo;s takedown of Thoreau in the latest New Yorker! I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a fan of Henry David, and we see his offspring littering the Pacific Northwest hiking trails, beaches, and REIs &amp;mdash; especially on sale days. This was a delicious read for me.
The real Thoreau was, in the fullest sense of the word, self-obsessed: narcissistic, fanatical about self-control, adamant that he required nothing beyond himself to understand and thrive in the world.</description>

      <description>Adolescence is the uncomfortable transition from childhood, when one assumes that one is the center of the universe, to adulthood, when one realizes that this is not true. Just about everything we understand about teenagers makes sense when viewed from this lens â the sense of injustice, the anger, the nihilism. It takes at least a full decade just to get over the horrific realization that the universe will continue without us one day.</description>

Everybody I know who has read this book has done nothing but rave about it, and as this linked BBC article says: âThe judges had come to a unanimous decision in less than two hours.â
Congratulations to James. If youâd like to know more about him â and his winning book â Jess Walter and Sherman Alexie recently talked to him on their podcast A Tiny Sense of Accomplishment.</description>

      <description>Itâs the year 2018. In a press conference, NASA scientists have just announced a shocking new discovery. As part of their research into cryogenic sleep for deep-space flights, they have finally uncovered the secret of immortality. At that announcement, the press corps immediately respond with murmuring and more exciteable, goose-like noises, but as the sussuration begins to build into a straight-on frenzy, the lead scientist raises her hands. Wait a minute, she says to the assembled media.</description>

which year goes with what.
My memory: as good as milk.
My family: spoiled through

we refuse to announce defeat,
death. In this house, the margins
of mourning are tucked in,
pleated to the neck.
In August, my uncle dies
and no one tells his children.
He crosses his arms

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a fun exercise: guess which of these four quotes about money and class are actually from the recent Jonathan Franzen profile in the Financial Times and which of these quotes I made up to make Jonathan Franzen sound bad.
1. Jonathan Franzen understands poverty:
âI am literally, in terms of my income, a 1 per center, yes,â he says, his eyes not on me but on the empty table next to us.</description>

      <description>Having a conversation with white people about race â specifically, about black people in America, inspired, say, by the shooting of Michael Brown or Ta-Nehisi Coates&amp;rsquo; essay on reparations â is easy until you get to one of those words. Privilege, say, or supremacy, or institutional, or, god forbid, reparations. Those words are hard because white people hear them differently than minorities. White people hear &amp;ldquo;privilege&amp;rdquo; and think &amp;ldquo;this person wants me to give up power.</description>

      <description>MONDAY Our week begins with the Monorail Poetry Series at Fred Wildlife Refuge. Local author Tara Atkinson, who has a book coming out from Instant Future soon that Iâm very excited to read, will be joined by Portland author Rachael Jensen and a Brooklyn writer with the unbelievable name of Sampson Starkweather. Jensen recently published her first chapbook with Snoot Books, and Starkweather has written a lot of books and also created âa multi-media website of pop/love GIF poems.</description>

Go see rare book and ephemera dealers from around the country, and even from overseas. Lots of amazing finds for book lovers, collectors, and even for looky-loos.
Our thanks to them for their sponsorship over the past three weeks. Partnering with events like this is exactly why we&amp;rsquo;re so excited about our sponsorship model.</description>

      <description>[What To Do If Your Workplace Is Too White](http://transom.org/2015/stephanie-foo/) A manifesto by This American Life&amp;rsquo;s Stephanie Foo that tackles excuses for lack of diversity in public radio, and how, exactly, to address it.
Thereâs a question Iâve heard a lot lately. Program directors and hosts approach me at radio events more and more often (itâs not hard to spot me â Iâm often one of the only People of Color [POC] in the room) and ask, âHow do I reach a more diverse audience?</description>

Consider two different jobs: in the first one, you sit in a room all by yourself at a computer and make up people, places, and events for months â more likely years â at a time. You push those imaginary people around in your head and try to coax a narrative out of them. You work on the same sentences over and over until you decide theyâre as close to perfect as you can make them, or until a deadline rolls over you and you have to give them up.</description>

      <description>Cartoonist J.R. Williams is reporting on Facebook that Northwestern autobiographical comics writer Dennis Eichhorn has passed away:
Aw, crap. Denny&#39;s gone. His wife Jane called to tell me that he passed away this morning. She suggested I put out the word. He was a great friend, and I&#39;m sure gonna miss him. Williams and Eichhorn were frequent collaborators, perhaps most notably on The Legend of Wild Man Fischer.
Eichhorn&amp;rsquo;s Real Stuff comics are wonderful examples of autobiographical comics, true examples of how good the collaboration between writer and artist can be.</description>

They&amp;rsquo;ll each read and then we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss &amp;ldquo;the boundaries and limits of genre&amp;rdquo; as part of the Frye&amp;rsquo;s ongoing Literary Festival, which is part of the Genius / 21 Century / Seattle exhibit. It&amp;rsquo;s at 2 pm, it&amp;rsquo;s free, and the Frye would be thrilled if you pre-registered for the event on their site.</description>

      <description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it to the comic book store last night because I was too busy celebrating at the launch party for California Four O&amp;rsquo;Clock, the debut novel from Seattle Review of Books co-founder Martin McClellan. It was a big new comics Wednesday to miss; a ton of Marvel Comics relaunched yesterday with all-new first issues and status quos, including Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Doctor Strange. Of those three, the only one that I&amp;rsquo;m at all interested in is Doctor Strange; writer Jason Aaron is often pretty good, and artist Chris Bachalo&amp;rsquo;s noodly illustrations seem perfect for the baroqueness of the character as created by Steve Ditko.</description>

      <description>For as long as Iâve been covering Amazonâs growth, rumors have circulated about the online retailer opening a brick-and-mortar store that serves as a kind of showroom. But Iâve never seen a report as well-researched and as compelling as this Shelf Awareness story suggesting that Amazon is in the process of opening a bookstore in University Village, where Blue C Sushi used to be. And this rumor suggests that itâs specifically a bookstore, and not just a place to buy Amazonâs tablets and hardware, as all the previous rumors have indicated.</description>

      <description>Dear Editor:
Donna Miscolta raises a valid point in her review/essay, &amp;ldquo;Reflections by and about white people.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the phrase &amp;ldquo;comprehensive snapshot&amp;rdquo; means, as used in a short review that appeared in Seattle Met, but its application to the anthology, Seattle: City of Literature set Donna off about the lack of ethnic diversity in the book.
Initially, I was willing to go along with her criticism. If you look at the table of contents, only six people of color contributed.</description>

Last night was not an official _Seattle Review of Books_ party, it was the launch party for my book [_California Four O&#39;Clock_](http://californiafouroclock.com). But since Paul and I were both there, and we talked about the site, and since some of you were there too and came up to say hello and introduce yourselves, I just wanted to say thank you. We had a grand time.</description>

      <description>The Nobel was granted to Alexievitch &amp;ldquo;for her polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time.&amp;rdquo; Remarkably, she is the very first journalist to ever win the Nobel in Literature. The BBC explains,
Her best-known works in English translation include *Voices From Chernobyl*, an oral history of the 1986 nuclear catastrophe; and *Boys In Zinc*, a collection of first-hand accounts from the Soviet-Afghan war. The title refers to the zinc coffins in which the dead came home.</description>

      <description>1. David Sedaris will be reading at Benaroya Hall on Sunday, November 15th, 2015. I&amp;rsquo;ll be introducing him, as I&amp;rsquo;ve done at every one of his annual Benaroya Hall appearances for the better part of a decade. The best part of introducing David Sedaris is that when you&amp;rsquo;re done introducing him, you get to watch David Sedaris read. He&amp;rsquo;s simply one of the funniest, best readers in the world. Tickets for this performance are very nearly sold out.</description>

      <description>On her blog, cartoonist Julia Wertz describes her interactions with a male fan that are pretty much textbook harassment. He ordered a book of Wertz&amp;rsquo;s cartoons and included the instruction &amp;ldquo;Iâd be enchanted if you rubbed your vagina on it.â Wertz refunded his money and refused the order, which then made the fan mad. He insisted that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t harassing her âÂ after all, he says, he framed the instruction as something that he almost wrote in an e-mail to her, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a real instruction.</description>

      <description>You are the North and I am the South.
My tanks aim for you. I shoot you a thousand times.
Your missiles launch into my oceans. You raise monuments to scorn me.
You eat clams cooked in gasoline.
I drink milk and cider. I raise skyscrapers of businessmen.
You build towers of empty rooms. You refuse me from where I am most loved.
I clean a wintermelon of its guts and seeds cling to my wet fingers.</description>

      <description>Dee Lockett at Vulture says:
Ten years after Edward Cullen and Bella Swan made vampires virtually inescapable, Stephenie Meyer is back to turn your tweens once again. In celebration of the first book&#39;s anniversary, Meyer has rewritten *Twilight* with the genders of the saga&#39;s star-crossed lovers reversed. Meet Beau and Edythe, main characters of the newly feminist reading of the series now dubbed *Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined*, out today. In this version, Bella is Beau, a teen boy who moves to Forks, Washington, and finds himself enamored with the vampire Edythe, the female version of Edward.</description>

If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, please read Vijith Assar&amp;rsquo;s excellent column for McSweeney&amp;rsquo;s about the way various grammatical tricks can completely change the meaning of a sentence.

2. Over at Okey Panky, Isaac Cates contributes a handful of comic strips based on a comics game of his own invention: select two comics panels from a deck of previously-created panels.</description>

Salinger as a term for a homosexual man in 1951.â This book mashes up Salingerâs classic and 40 other works of fiction that use homophobic slurs to create a new narrative.</description>

      <description>[Writing Better Trans Characters](http://www.strangehorizons.com/2015/20150928/1morgan-a.shtml) Cheryl Morgan offers guidance on writing trans characters on Strange Horizons. Her audience here is SF writers, but nothing in her advice should be limited to that genre. Any writer could benefit from this read.
 I reject the idea that trans characters should only be written by trans people because cis folk are bound to get it wrong. While there are some really fine trans writers, there simply aren&#39;t enough of us in the world to do what is needed.</description>

      <description>SRoB tipper Nick Hanover alerted me to this excellent Graphic Policy story by Janelle Asselin about former Dark Horse Comics editor-in-chief Scott Allie, alleging that Allie frequently engaged in &amp;ldquo;out of control behavior while drunk and biting.&amp;rdquo; Yes, biting. As in, his nickname around the office was supposedly &amp;ldquo;Bitey the Clown.&amp;rdquo; Allie was removed from his job this fall after he publicly assaulted two people at a convention, but rumor has it that Dark Horse Comics in specific, and the Portland comics scene in general, has been covering up for Allie for years.</description>

Raban has been out of the spotlight for the last few years due to health-related issues, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited to report that he&amp;rsquo;s reading at the Frye tomorrow afternoon, from 3 to 4 pm.</description>

      <description>If youâre looking for a book to uplift you, to temporarily alleviate the struggles of your daily life, keep looking. Fates and Furies is a novel of attrition; National Book Award nominee Lauren Groff tears away at her characters as her readers lose faith in them. This marathon of a novel leaves you wondering: was it really worth the pain?
Well, it depends on what youâre into. Born into wealth, Lotto must clear hurdles to impress his mother, a feat he never quite achieves.</description>

      <description>Most licensed comics, letâs be honest, are terrible. Comics as merchandising spin-offs are usually afterthoughts, completely irrelevant to the movie or TV show that spawned them. Nothing happens in licensed comics, and somehow the approval of a fleet of corporate lawyers makes the officially licensed spin-offs feel even more like bad fan-fiction. Theyâre safe and boring and bland.
But every so often youâll encounter the proverbial exception that proves the rule.</description>

      <description>Ryan Boudinotâs anthology Seattle: City of Literature: Reflections from a Community of Writers was just released by Sasquatch Books and heralded in a Seattle Met review with this subheading: âThe new anthology is a comprehensive snapshot of Seattleâs community of writers, past and present.â
If âcomprehensiveâ means Seattleâs community of mostly white writers, then I suppose the descriptor is accurate. Boudinot in his preface calls the collection âa representative sampling,â which again can only be true if the community from which he is sampling is overwhelmingly white.</description>

      <description>Good news! The Seattle Weekly now has a weekly comics column in whch a local cartoonist illustrates an interview with a local band. In the first installment, the fabulous Robyn Jordan illustrates Janice Headley&amp;rsquo;s interview with the band Childbirth. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know Childbirth, they&amp;rsquo;re a poppy punk band that wears hospital gowns onstage and sing catchy, awesome feminist songs like &amp;ldquo;I Only Fucked You As a Joke.&amp;rdquo;
This is great stuff, and it manages to highlight our amazing comics scene and our amazing music scene, simultaneously.</description>

      <description>We love a good book review here at SRoB, and &amp;ldquo;Donald Trump Reviews The Lord of the Rings,&amp;rdquo; over at the Tusk, is a wonderful book review. This is what we mean when we keep grabbing people by the shoulders and shaking them violently and shouting &amp;ldquo;BOOK REVIEWS ARE LITERATURE!&amp;rdquo; This piece employs satire to comment on a book while also addressing current events. Go read it. (Also, sorry about the grabbing-you-by-the-shoulders-and-shouting thing.</description>

      <description>Porchlit is a yearlong site-specific literary installation founded by Yonnas Getahun, Campbell Thibo and Omar Willey. The idea is a relatively simple one: every day of the year, they record someone reading a piece on the porch of a particular Little Saigon home. Then they post a Soundcloud embed of the reading on the projectâs website. When they started the project, they operated under the assumption that the building attached to the porch was abandoned.</description>

      <title>Twitter to expand beyond its 140-character limitations</title>

      <description>The news broke today that Twitter is considering ways to allow users to write posts that are longer than its current 140-character limit. This is, obviously, a bad idea. Twitter with no limits is just blogging. Everyone has problems squeezing words into a tweet every now and again, but the constraint is what makes Twitter magical.
I&amp;rsquo;d argue that the constraint is the thing that makes Twitter so appealing to literary types, too.</description>

      <title>Sci-fi book awards are just as biased against women as literary book awards</title>

      <description>This post at Lady Business begins:
This project demonstrates that SFF books by or about cis women are less likely to win awards than books by or about cis men. Trans and nonbinary authors do not win awards at all, and trans or nonbinary protagonists are extremely rare. Overall, there were more award-winning books written by cis men about cis men than there were books by women about anybody... While of course the news they deliver is bad, it&amp;rsquo;s heartening to see other people taking up Nicola Griffith&amp;rsquo;s charge to count the number of womens&amp;rsquo; voices in literature.</description>

      <description>Marcellus Turner, the City Librarian at Seattle Public Library, has issued a letter responding to public criticism of the library&amp;rsquo;s rebranding campaign, which I wrote about last week. Turner writes that the rebranding has&amp;hellip;
...generated a flurry of interest and opinions from media representatives and the public. A recent exchange with a passionate Library supporter got at the heart of the concerns voiced by many around the Libraryâs proposed rebranding. That supporter didnât see the need for changing the library name or brand.</description>

and bears a crown in the kitchen, may we?
Who cares: cunt canât battle, key wonât tear.
Ugly decay, care for Pa and tell, we lonely.
So jail men care, met a lavish man, met a landlord.
(Eggpisode loiter ha! Advance donât at all, assuming mellow)
Me, countless, out to tear. Sane no, lend me.
Say I canât rain, end me.</description>

      <description>Galleycat has assembled excerpts of the ten most frequently challenged library books of 2015. Seattle&amp;rsquo;s own Sherman Alexie and Ellen Forney are right up at the top of the list with The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. Go give these books a try, and if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in reading further, please acquire copies of the books from your local library or independent bookstore. Banned Book Week isn&amp;rsquo;t just about celebrating the authors who push the boundaries of what&amp;rsquo;s acceptable; it&amp;rsquo;s also about celebrating the heroes who make those books available for everyone.</description>

If so, Iâm going to advise you that youâre perfectly welcome to read the rest of this book review, but itâs probably going to make you mad. Iâm probably not going to change your mind and youâre probably not going to change mine.</description>

MONDAY Itâs not very often that I send you out to Bellevue, but tonight I bring you a very good reason to head east: the Bellevue branch of University Book Store hosts an evening with a number of poets reading from Raising Lily Ledbetter, a compelling anthology of poetry about women at work that I reviewed a few weeks ago. Readers include Carolyne Wright, Eugenia Toledo, Kathya Alexander, Deborah Woodard, Judith Roche, Erin Fristad, and Mary Ellen Talley.</description>

But keep reading, it includes actually non-trivial life-advice. (Also, her tl;dr burn is sick).
 I doubt any readers stumbled over the word _unlearning_. We know negative prefixes (_a-, anti-, dys-, in-, ir-, non-, un-, etc_) and how they convey the inverse or opposite2 of a concept.</description>

(In case you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with the premise, the Humble Comics Bundle offers e-book editions of comics for a single low price, with a set-your-own-amount of that price going directly to charity.) A lot of the books in this Bundle are first volumes of great series âÂ Bone, Barefoot Gen â and others are wonderful standalone comics from artists like Julie Doucet, Leah Hayes, Chester Brown, and Jim Woodring.</description>

      <guid>http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/state-of-the-union/</guid>
      <description>At one time not so very long ago, American literature was rich with fiction about unions. Robert Cantwellâs Aberdeen-set novel Land of Plenty, which was recently revived by Jess Walter for local publisher Pharos Editions, is a good example of the genre. It makes sense that labor would mesh well with fiction; whenever you get a lot of people together in pursuit of a common goal, all sorts of interesting things happen.</description>

Throughout October The Seattle Public Library brings you **Booktoberfest**, a celebration of books and beer at venues all over the city.</description>

      <title>More bad news for e-books</title>

      <description>After noting the news yesterday that e-book sales have dipped ten percent in the first five months of this year, I stumbled across this post on Good E-Reader, which indicates that e-books might be doing even worse than the numbers are letting on:
At Book Expo America last April, [e-book retailer] Kobo dived deep into global reading behavior and analyzed the data. They found that **60% of e-books that are purchased from their complete line of apps, e-readers, tablets and via the web are never opened**.</description>

      <title>Opening the Folio</title>

Last night, in a stately room beneath the downtown YMCA, David Brewster welcomed a few dozen people to Folio, the Seattle Athenaeum. Brewster has done a lot of introducing in his life as a Seattleite â heâs the founder of the Seattle Weekly, Crosscut.com, and Town Hall Seattle. But you could argue that heâs never tried anything as ambitious as Folio before.
Brewster offered a brief overview of the athenaeum concept: originated by Benjamin Franklin as a way to help alleviate the high cost of books, athenaeums were private libraries dedicated to the prospect of âmutual improvementâ â places where people could come together to read, write, and discuss literature.</description>

      <title>Thursday Comics Hangover: Nameless finally gets off to a strong start</title>

      <description>Grant Morrison and Chris Burnhamâs comic Nameless is on its fifth issue this week, but it wasnât until this issue that the premise of the series really hit home for me: itâs Armageddon, only the asteroid is haunted. Thatâs about as high concept as you can get, and if Morrison is nothing else, heâs fundamentally skilled at high concept.
Itâs a pity that Nameless didnât start off very well. The story opened in media res, with a nameless dabbler in the supernatural âÂ well, to be specific, his name is Nameless â being recruited to fend off the asteroid Xibalba.</description>

 The submissions form for the next Ignite Seattle is now open; you can submit at any point between now and January 8th. I would recommend it. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie: the Ignite format, with its ever-advancing slideshow and its no-notes rule, is very intimidating.</description>

      <title>It matters that Kickstarter has reformed as a public benefit corporation</title>

      <description>Itâs obvious to anybody who has worked with Kickstarter: they really do walk the walk. To their core, they believe in the ethos of creation, and that their platform is a good way to empower creative people to fund their projects. Or, as the case often is, to test their idea in a very functional way and see if it has any legs.
But if you think of Kickstarter as a place where people make ridiculous coolers, tech gadgets, or million-selling games, you probably missed this part of their mission.</description>

      <description>Alexandra Alter at the New York Times reports that e-book sales have slipped for the first time in recent memory.
Now, there are signs that some e-book adopters are returning to print, or becoming hybrid readers, who juggle devices and paper. E-book sales fell by 10 percent in the first five months of this year, according to the Association of American Publishers, which collects data from nearly 1,200 publishers. Digital books accounted last year for around 20 percent of the market, roughly the same as they did a few years ago.</description>

      <description>As Iâve gotten to know the staff of our September Bookstore of the Month a little better, I realized that [Seattle Mystery Bookshop](http://www.seattlemystery.com)âs greatest strength is in its recommendations. The staff is impossibly well-versed in the genre. So I thought Iâd ask them for some recommendations for our readers, particularly those of you out there who would never normally consider giving a mystery a try. Thanks so much to Seattle Mystery Bookshop owner [JB Dickey](http://www.</description>

      <description>Oyster, which trumpeted itself as &amp;ldquo;the Netflix of books&amp;rdquo; when it launched a couple of years ago, is closing down. (They were never able to resolve that most basic of questions: isn&amp;rsquo;t the &amp;ldquo;Netflix of Books&amp;rdquo; a library?) But most of the Oyster team seems to be moving to Google Play&amp;rsquo;s Books division.
Does this mean Google is about to launch an all-you-can-read e-book subscription service? Who cares? Probably. We&amp;rsquo;ll find out eventually.</description>

      <description>Wow! Anyone who follows Between the World and Me author Ta-Nehisi Coates knows that he&amp;rsquo;s an ardent comics fan, but I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t see this coming. The New York Times says:
...it seems only natural that Marvel has asked Mr. Coates to take on a new Black Panther series set to begin next spring. Writing for that comics publisher is a childhood dream that, despite the seeming incongruity, came about thanks to his day job.</description>

      <description>Because her parents worked for the penitentiary system, a large part of local cartoonist Colleen Frakesâ youth was spent on McNeil Island, the last prison island in the United States not connected to the mainland by roads. Though McNeil was relatively close to Tacoma on the south Sound, it was still disconnected from civilization in nearly every way; most prison employees lived in a company town on the island and used infrequent ferry service to connect to civilization.</description>

      <description>Over the last two days, weâve seen a lot of outrage on local social media over the Seattle Public Libraryâs rebranding. You can see what SPL is considering through their survey, where theyâre âseeking public comment on a proposed new name and logo design.â The name change would be to âSeattle Public Libraries,â and the logo design would involve either a few patterns that are apparently loosely based on the windows of the downtown branch of the Library or a series of connected dots.</description>

      <description>MONDAY Your week begins at University Book Store, where Fran Wilde reads from her new fantasy novel Updraft. Itâs set in a world âbuilt in towers of living boneâ and stars a main character who has the âability to control the invisible predators that roam the skies with her voice.â That sounds entirely bonkers, and is therefore worthy of our respect.

      <description>Looking for some Sunday inspiration? Maria Dahvana Headley, author most recently of Magnolia, wrote a seventeen tweet mini-essay on womenâs agency in the arts. Itâs personal, professional, gives good advice, and is about something near-and-dear to our hearts: writers being self-aware and claiming the time and space they need to create the best works they can.
The whole thread is worth your time, but here are a few highlights that caught my eye:</description>

She starts a fake Karaoke truck, and manages to establish online credibility without too much effort.
Mark my words: reputation online is the battleground of the future. Trust is the key component.
For $5, I could get 200 Facebook fans, or 6,000 Twitter followers, or I could get @SMExpertsBiz to tweet about the truck to the accountâs 26,000 Twitter fans.</description>

      <description>Collins died in Los Angeles today, the cause was breast cancer. Itâs hard to imagine a single person selling as many books, reportedly 500 million copies of her 32 novels, as she did. The younger sister of actor Joan Collins, she made a career of the scandalous, covering romances, dalliances, deceptions, and desire. Apparently, Vanity Fair once called her âHollywoodâs own Marcel Proustâ, which seems as good as a compliment as anybody could ever hope to carry.</description>

      <title>The most thoughtful obituary writer in all of southeastern Alaska</title>

      <description>At a time when reality TV continues its relentless portrayal of Alaska as a source of extreme and outlandish (even ridiculous) behavior, author Heather Lende consistently reminds readers that it is actually a place populated by people, just like anywhere else. As the newspaper obituary writer for the small town of Haines, (population about 2,000), Lende has written for years about ordinary people who have quietly lived extraordinary lives. She shared some of these stories in her first book, If You Lived Here, Iâd Know Your Name and then, after suffering horrific injuries when she was hit by a truck near her home, wrote a memoir of her recovery, Take Good Care of the Garden and the Dogs.</description>

This is a hugely ambitious project, and we look forward to Wilson staying at the top of the cultural conversation for another decade because of it.</description>

Jacob was invited to be the keynote speaker at a Publisher&amp;rsquo;s Weekly gathering:
My last year has been intense. My book *The Sleepwalkerâs Guide to Dancing* came out, I spent a few months touring internationally, and from a distance, it looked like one big party.</description>

      <description>People ask me all the time how I read so much. They usually don&amp;rsquo;t like my answer: I don&amp;rsquo;t watch as much TV as the typical person, and I don&amp;rsquo;t play video games. There&amp;rsquo;s no easy quick-fix, besides the fact that you have to make time in life for the things that you really value.
With that in mind, I&amp;rsquo;d like to direct your attention to this Harvard Business Review piece by Hugh McGuire, titled &amp;ldquo;How Making Time for Books Made Me Feel Less Busy.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Jess Walter and Sherman Alexie&amp;rsquo;s podcast, A Tiny Sense of Accomplishment. Many conversational podcasts don&amp;rsquo;t work because they feel unstructured, but Tiny regularly delivers smart and funny conversation on a few tightly focused subjects.
Just this morning, a very special episode of Tiny was published. This one was taped live at Bumbershoot a week or so ago, and it features special musical guests Rachel Flotard and Neko Case.</description>

(*Every comics fan knows that Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country.* Thursday Comics Hangover *is a weekly column reviewing some of the books I pick up at [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/), my friendly neighborhood comic book store.*)
In nerd vernacular, the phrase âHey, kids! Comics!â has taken on a couple of disparate meanings. It originated as a sign on the top of drugstore comics spinner racks (some iterations of the sign were paired with another sign that read âWholesome entertaining comicsâ).</description>

      <description>Alex de Campi&amp;rsquo;s critically acclaimed Wonder Woman comic, Sensation Comics, is being canceled. DC Comics has moved the separate ongoing Wonder Woman comic, which is terrible, under the Superman editorial banner. On her blog, de Campi makes pubic some gossip that&amp;rsquo;s been writhing just under the surface of the comics industry for decades now:
Now, the Superman office allegedly employs no women, and a cursory glance over the mastheads of several Superman titles and Wonder Woman seems to confirm that allegation.</description>

Some of the pieces are hilarious. Many are furious at Michael Derrick Hudson for submitting work under the name Yi-Fen Chou. Others are furious at the book&amp;rsquo;s editor, Sherman Alexie, for choosing to leave the poem in the anthology after he discovered that Hudson had appropriated another culture to submit his work.</description>

There were boxes everywhere. He made a deal with Seattle Mystery founder Bill Farley: âI traded him work for store creditâ on that first day, Dickey says, and âa few weeks later, I ended up starting with him part-time so he could do other, non-bookselling things.</description>

Luckily, Griffith did do a gender count, and she finds the results to be &amp;ldquo;appalling.&amp;rdquo; There are fewer women on the shortlist than usual, she says, and very few of the books are about the experiences of women.</description>

      <description>Today, local literary magazine The James Franco Review, which treats every submission as though it was written by James Franco, started rolling out an &amp;ldquo;Emergency Issue&amp;rdquo; on art and engagment. What does that mean?
Writers, editors, and artists around the country explored what it meant for them to be politically or consciously engaged in their work and to also examine literatureâs relationship to safety. The first piece, by Nancy Jooyoun Kim, is live now, and it&amp;rsquo;s powerful stuff, about her own experience with a white writer who workshopped a story with a black protagonist.</description>

      <description>Catapult, a new publisher and online platform, launched today. (Yes, as the Wall Street Journal noted last week, it&amp;rsquo;s funded by Koch money. Not that Koch money.) Their first print book is a short story collection by Padgett Powell, and there are plenty more on the way.
Everybody in the book business is very excited about Catapult for a number of reasons: first up, they&amp;rsquo;re publishing a lot of great stories on the site for their first day, including one from Joy Williams.</description>

      <description>In case you weren&amp;rsquo;t keeping track, Arundel Books, which used to be a beautiful bookstore on 1st Avenue downtown, is now a beautiful bookstore in the old Wessel &amp;amp; Lieberman space facing Occidental Park in Pioneer Square. And Arundel founder Phil Bevis still publishes books, both under the Arundel Press shingle and, more expansively, as Chatwin Books. (One of Arundel Press&amp;rsquo;s titles, Nicole Sarrocco&amp;rsquo;s Karate Bride, is a Seattle poetry classic.</description>

      <description>The *Seattle Review of Books* recommends one literary event for every day of the week. As always, we aspire to a nice mix of national and local authors in a variety of venues. This week, weâre following the suggestion of one [Jeff Youngstrom](https://twitter.com/jeffy/status/641331492690481153), who wants us to bold the author names in this post. What do you think? Helpful? Not helpful? If you have any suggestions, weâd love to hear them.</description>

      <description>[Man, weeping](http://aeon.co/magazine/society/is-there-anything-wrong-with-men-who-cry/) Sandra Newman | Twitter&amp;rdquo;) &amp;mdash; who is the funniest person on Twitter, and an amazing writer to boot &amp;mdash; looks at the history of male tears.
So where did all the male tears go? The truth is, we donât know for certain. There was no anti-crying movement. No treatises were written against menâs tears, and no leaders of church or state introduced measures to discourage them. Their decline occurred so slowly and quietly that no one seems to have noticed it happening.</description>

      <description>Today is the 14th anniversary of the 9&amp;frasl;11 attacks. This morning, a Facebook user shared this Warren Ellis fan forum thread from the day of the attacks. Reading through it, I realized I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten so many details from that day: the confusion, the fear, the hope, the hatred, the ugliness.
In this one thread on a comic writer&amp;rsquo;s forum, you can watch America turn itself upside down and rip itself apart.</description>

      <description>All writing advice is expendable. It is necessarily incomplete and reflects the advice-giverâs biases and preferences. Such advice can certainly be useful, but it offers only one version of what writing can be. This holds true for Mary Karrâs new book The Art of Memoir, an introduction to her theories about the genre, a compendium of suggestions for writing, and a close look at some of her favorite examples. The beguiling tone and the witty, lively style from her successful memoirs The Liarsâ Club, _Cherry, and Lit are on full display in this new book.</description>

      <description>Over at the Seattle Times, Mary Ann Gwinn has the exclusive story on this year&amp;rsquo;s Washington State Book Awards finalists. You should click through for all the details, but here are some of the authors I&amp;rsquo;m especially rooting for: Kim-An Lieberman was posthumously recognized for her second poetry collection, In Orbit. SRoB contributor Kelli Russell Agodon is a finalist in the poetry category as well. Peter Mountford is a finalist for his excellent second novel, The Dismal Science.</description>

      <description>The Best American Poetry 2015 controversy continues with a New York Times story that suggests Michael Derrick Hudson, the white poet who took on a Chinese pseudonym in order to make some asinine &amp;ldquo;point,&amp;rdquo; might have stolen the name from a real-life Yi-Fen Chou:
The family of a woman named Yi-Fen Chou, who attended the same high school in Fort Wayne, Ind., as Mr. Hudson, has stepped forward, demanding that he immediately stop using [the pseudonym].</description>

That woman yelling at the parking lot attendant because itâll cost her $8 to park her fancy car in the lot behind Town Hall? Total Franzen person. The miserable-looking bald man in a suit dragging his wife up the sidewalk as she staggers behind him in her too-high heels?</description>

      <description>Every comics fan knows Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country. Thursday Comics Hangover is a weekly column reviewing some of the new books that I pick up at [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/), my friendly neighborhood comic book store.
The new collected volume of Saga, volume five, hit the stands yesterday. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read it yet, but I&amp;rsquo;ve already said on multiple occasions that Saga is the best mainstream ongoing comic in the business today, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think volume 5 is going to damage my opinion.</description>

But they&amp;rsquo;ve just announced their schedule for the month of October, and there&amp;rsquo;s some great stuff happening in the lead-in to the festival. First up, on October 8th, Short Run goes to the Capitol Hill artwalk with an art show at Joe Bar featuring comics artists from Seattle, LA, Chicago, and Toronto. On the 28th, they&amp;rsquo;ll be hosting special festival guests Charles Forsman and Melissa Mendes at the Capitol Hill branch of the library.</description>

When we announced that weâd like to interview authors who are leaving town for our [Exit Interview](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/exit-interview-talking-with-kate-lebo-about-why-she-left-seattle-for-spokane/) feature, the most-suggested writer was [Kelly Davio](http://kellydavio.com/), a poet, columnist for The Butter, and co-publisher and poetry editor at the [*Tahoma Literary Review*](http://www.tahomaliteraryreview.com/). The e-mails we received were dripping with sadness about Davioâs departure; the word âirreplaceableâ came up. Davioâs debut poetry collection, [*Burn This House*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781597092364) was publshed by Red Hen Press in 2013.</description>

      <description>This is terrible news. National Geographic was a nonprofit for over 125 years. Now it&amp;rsquo;s likely going to become just another content farm for Rupert Murdoch&amp;rsquo;s multinational entertainment corporation. It&amp;rsquo;s very hard to find a silver lining in this deal.</description>

      <description>You canât stay in business for as long as (our September Bookstore of the Month) Seattle Mystery Bookshop has without becoming really, really good at a thing or two. The most readily apparent sign of the bookstoreâs excellence is in its selection, which I wrote about last week. The selection is really quite impressive â the shelves of Seattle Mystery Bookshop display a stock that is comprehensive enough to please the most deeply OCD mystery nerd and yet welcoming enough to appeal to a novice browser who has never before considered reading a mystery novel.</description>

      <description>Of all the think-pieces published yesterday about Sherman Alexie and the Best American Poetry controversy, Jia Tolentino&amp;rsquo;s piece at Jezebel is by far the best. Don&amp;rsquo;t bother with the rest of them. This has been a think-piece public service announcement.</description>

      <description>You should absolutely read Noah Davis&amp;rsquo;s overview of what it means to be a freelance writer in 2015.
Many newer outlets offer upwards of fifty cents per word or moreâsites like The Verge might pay a dollar per wordâas do established publications including *New York*&#39;s blog network and *The Guardian*. âYou can expect that two hundred and fifty dollars is an ultimate baseline for anything that you do,â Kyle Chayka, a New York-based freelancer, told me.</description>

      <description>Early in his new novel This Is Your Life, Harriet Chance!, Jonathan Evison makes an artistic decision thatâs sure to divide his readership. Itâs on page 14, at the beginning of the bookâs fifth chapter, and thereâs no way to talk around it, so here we go: Evison sets a scene in heaven, where Harriet Chanceâs recently deceased husband, Bernard, gets a dressing-down from a bureaucrat named Charmichael for interfering with the world of the living.</description>

      <description>A rogue wave of old grief capsized me at the bar.
The night in my mouth had the names all wrong:
Herodotus. Herodotus.
My chair was upside down
but I was making it look casual.
Earlier, when my glasses flew off and his glasses flew off
and they did a little orbit around each other
before returning to our facesâ
but that was before Herodotus.
Herodotus tells us:
Human happiness never continues long in one stay.</description>

      <description>On the Best American Poetry blog, Sherman Alexie explains the process of guest-editing Best American Poetry 2015. He also addresses a controversy that&amp;rsquo;s swirling around the book:
I chose a strange and funny and rueful poem written by Yi-Fen Chou, which turns out to be a Chinese pseudonym used by a white male poet named Michael Derrick Hudson as a means of subverting what he believes to be a politically correct poetry business.</description>

      <description>Through Sunday, our sponsor Chatwin Books is allowing us run the introduction and a full chapter from J.G. Perkins&amp;rsquo; The Announcers.
 For those who shared it, the American Dream was wonderful. I awakened from part of that dream early and watched, in one way or another, much of the rest of the country follow over several decades. Some are still asleep. Like many of the awakened, I found that my dream had elements of a nightmare.</description>

      <description>As we teeter on the cusp of Labor Day weekend, itâs important to remember that women in America are still not an equal part of the workforce. According to whitehouse.gov, full-time working women still earn 78 cents for every dollar men earn, and a typical 25-year-old woman makes $5,000 less per year than a typical man of the same age. Itâs interesting to note that those figures are from the same White House where President Obama signed his very first bill, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, into law in January of 2009.</description>

      <description>Letâs say it together now, with the requisite air quotes and eye rolls: âwomenâs fiction.â All the expected arguments have been made about why the categorization is useless at best, offensive at worst. As Meg Wolitzer noted in the New York Times Book Review last weekend, while this piece was in production, âBringing up the womenâs question â I mean the womenâs fiction question â is not unlike mentioning the national debt at a dinner party.</description>

      <description>Every comics fan knows Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country. Thursday Comics Hangover is a weekly column reviewing some of the new books that I pick up at [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/), my friendly neighborhood comic book store.
Bob Fingermanâs Minimum Wage comics, published by Fantagraphics, were most definitely products of the 1990s. The main character, Rob, dressed in 90s bike messenger chic â mostly black clothing, a wallet chain, chunky boots, some chin hair, a propensity to wear shorts a little too often.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s be clear that this post at Web Urbanist is a multi-page list, which is a genre of blog post that usually deserves nothing but scorn. But I&amp;rsquo;ll have to give it a pass, because it&amp;rsquo;s about 14 modern library designs and it&amp;rsquo;s the most beautiful thing I&amp;rsquo;ve seen on the internet this week. Every single one of these spaces looks like a wonderful place to read; I especially love the Prague National Library, which looks like a giant cartoon amoeba.</description>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1439589944468/jance.jpg)
J.A. Jance is the author of more than fifty mystery novels and novellas, parceled out into four distinct series. Arguably her most popular series revolves around Seattle investigator J.P. Beaumont, who has headlined 24 books since his introduction in 1985. Jance has been publishing at least one book a year for three decades, and sheâs a bestselling author many times over. Her latest mystery, *Dance of the Bones*, pairs Beaumont with another of her series protagonists, Sheriff Brandon Walker, for the first time.</description>

      <description>On an uncharacteristically blustery Saturday, Seattle Mystery Bookshop employees Fran and Adele are getting the store ready for an author visit, but theyâre happy to stop for anyone who wanders in out of the windstorm. They sometimes greet visitors with the words of the bookshopâs owner, JB Dickey: âyouâre welcome to stay as long as you like, but we wonât feed you and we wonât do your laundry.â
Fran has worked at Seattle Mystery Bookshop for over 12 years.</description>

      <description>Swapna Krishna at Panels has collected some tweets by local novelist/comics writer G. Willow Wilson about motherhood and the business of art. Wilson, who&amp;rsquo;s responding to a popular essay by Amanda Palmer, explains that editors and publishers levy &amp;ldquo;a mommy tax&amp;rdquo; on writers and other artists.
As contractors, Wilson says, women artists have &amp;ldquo;zero legal protection,&amp;rdquo; and the story of her own experiences is a real eye-opener: &amp;ldquo;I wrote ALIF THE UNSEEN while pregnant and edited it with a newborn sleeping on my chest.</description>

      <description>You have two months to apply for Jack Straw&amp;rsquo;s 2016 Writers Program. Don&amp;rsquo;t know what that is? I&amp;rsquo;ll let them explain:
Twelve writers, selected by an invited curator, create new work during the residency to be presented through live readings, recorded interviews, a published anthology, and as podcasts on our web site. Participants also receive professional training in voice and microphone technique, performance and delivery, and interviews. Previous Jack Straw writers include Rebecca Hoogs and David Schmader.</description>

      <description>(Once in a while, I take a new book with me to lunch and give it a half an hour or so to grab my attention. **Lunch Date** is my judgment on that speed-dating experience.)
**Whoâs your date today?** *Atlanta Nights*, a novel that was crowdsourced by nearly three dozen science fiction writers.
**Whereâd you go?** [Sprout](http://www.sprout-salads.com/) on the ground floor of the Smith Tower.
**Whatâd you eat?** I had the South by Northwest salad, which has all the ingredients you&#39;d expect (steak, romaine, salsa, a cilantro-lime dressing) and some you wouldn&#39;t (chili-roasted sweet potatoes).</description>

      <description>Every Tuesday morning, we present a poem for you to enjoy, but this week we&amp;rsquo;re going to do something a little different. I want to call a piece of public art to your attention. Robert Montgomery&amp;rsquo;s poem &amp;ldquo;The Stars Pulled Down for Real&amp;rdquo; is the latest site-specific artwork at All Rise, the public art space located between Denny and John, down in the Denny Triangle. All Rise&amp;rsquo;s website explains Montgomery&amp;rsquo;s work as &amp;ldquo;confront[ing] a post-utopian current while echoing a full, at times romantic, chronology of a land divided, shaped, and built ever-upward.</description>

      <description>Even though Seattle is happily back to its normal grey drizzle, we can&amp;rsquo;t forget that the eastern half of Washington is currently battling the worst wildfires in state history. We&amp;rsquo;ve already looked at how booksellers are surviving the fires, but here&amp;rsquo;s a project that&amp;rsquo;s worthy of your attention: every other day, Washington state Poet Laureate Elizabeth Austen will publish a poem relating to the wildfires. Yesterday, she published a beautiful poem by William Stafford about the Tillamook Burn.</description>

      <description>Some asshole at the Guardian who has never read one of Terry Pratchett&amp;rsquo;s novels thinks Terry Pratchett is overrated. Yep, it&amp;rsquo;s the same old boring &amp;ldquo;serious literature&amp;rdquo; conversation, with an added smear on a recently deceased author for good measure.
This is an obvious plea for attention, and you should ignore it. Go read a Terry Pratchett novel instead; if you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with his work, we recommend Mort or The Colour of Magic to get you started.</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s sponsor is Chatwin Books, and we&amp;rsquo;re featuring the introduction and a full chapter from The Announcers, by J.G Perkins.
This is the first volume in Perkins&amp;rsquo; 19-volume Darkness Before Mourning, one of the largest series of serious fiction ever created by a single author. We&amp;rsquo;re featuring the Introduction, and chapter 15, for you to read in their entirety.
 For those who shared it, the American Dream was wonderful.</description>

      <description>Imagine my delight when the first three pages of Ann Leckieâs Ancillary Justice boggled me with pronouns. Theyâre all female: she and her; no he, no him. This Elizabeth Moon-like space opera with big ships and engineering settings inhabits a new conceptual landscape, but is it simply a local effect? Ursula Le Guinâs The Left Hand of Darkness (1969) uses ambi-sexual characters to question sexual determination, but the male-female dyad is still the basis for that society.</description>

We also discussed diversity, why Seattle is such an amazing city for books, and the pleasure of not discussing Jonathan Franzen. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll give it a listen and then subscribe to Theatrical Mustang, which interviews all sorts of literary, theater, and musical types. Start with this interview with the wonderful Kathy Hsieh.</description>

      <description>MONDAY Our week begins at Elliott Bay Book Company, where the wonderful independent publisher Red Hen Press presents a group reading with Tom Janikowski,Amaranth Borsuk, and Patrick Milan. Theyâll all read from their most recent titles. But this reading also features local author Elissa Washuta, author of My Body is a Book of Rules and, most recently, Starvation Mode. (You can read my review of the latter right here.) A reading from Washuta alone is reason to show up, but tonight youâll get to see three other writers and support a fantastic small press.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;d like to try one of his books, the obvious place to start is The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, although if you&amp;rsquo;re in the mood for a novel, Richard Powers&amp;rsquo;s The Echo Maker features a Sacks-like writer. (Some have complained about the way Powers treated Sacks, but I respectfully disagree; in fact, my way into Sacks&amp;rsquo;s prose came through The Echo Maker.</description>

      <description>[No Country for Young women](http://incisive.nu/2015/no-country/) Erin Kissane on why she stopped reading fiction written by men, and movies with male protagonists: &amp;ldquo;I just got tired.&amp;rdquo;
 Itâs not even that my politics quail at something I otherwise enjoy. Iâm just stung and sad, and ashamed that I keep falling for the same trick. If a piece of fiction is made by and emotionally centered on men, chances are, it defaults to the belief that women are nothing but fuel.</description>

 He unwound a piece of stained red cloth from around the upper part of his left thigh and he dropped the saturated tourniquet into a soaked pile beside him. He took two fingers and tore open his trousers and beneath the breach lay a bullet wound that fizzled deep, the skin encircling the wound lipped out as if it had been disturbed by some plated tremor deep below.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Nearly every woman I know has either had an abortion or helped another woman get one,&amp;rdquo; begins the latest post on local author Lesley Hazleton&amp;rsquo;s blog. Hazleton is a brilliant writer, a fearless thinker, and a deeply compassionate human being, and in this post she puts all those qualities to the service of one important cause. Hazleton wants to &amp;ldquo;break the weird veil of shame and secrecy that still hangs over the decision&amp;rdquo; to have an abortion, &amp;ldquo;even when abortion is legal.</description>

      <description>Earlier this month, at a progressive rally in downtown Seattle, I watched from across the street as hundreds of allegedly liberal Seattleites booed the suggestion that Black Lives Matter. I saw a middle-aged preppy married couple raise their middle fingers in the air during a moment of silence in memory of a young black man who was killed by police officer. I saw angry white grandmothers beg officers to arrest the two young black women who took the stage, and I heard a small group of hip Capitol Hill dudes, horrifyingly, chant âtase those cunts.</description>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1440704453028/DavidSchmader.jpg)
This morning, local author (and, full disclosure, my friend and former coworker) David Schmader [made an exciting announcement](https://twitter.com/davidschmader/status/636965842761027585): heâs the new creative director at the [Greater Seattle Bureau of Fearless Ideas](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/teri-hein-it-lsquohurts-a-littlersquo-to-split-from-826-national/). The BFI is a nonprofit writing and communications center â until last year, it was [known as 826 Seattle](http://fearlessideas.org/) â that offers writing workshops, tutoring assistance, field trips, and other writerly pursuits for Seattle-area youth. Schmader has for decades been a beloved fixture in Seattleâs writing scene; you may know him from his brilliant solo shows, or his insanely fun *Showgirls* screenings, or his brainstorming classes at Hugo House, or his Last Days column in *The Stranger*.</description>

      <description>Being an arachnophobe is popular. It seems to be completely within the realm of reason and decency to severely panic at the sight of a spider of any size. Adult human beings will recount stories of their terror without a hint of shame â sometimes it even seems they do so with pride. While some may capture the spider under a glass, barricade it within using a sheet of paper, and escort it outside, it can be safely assumed that every year millions of spiders are instead crushed upon sight.</description>

      <description>Every comics fan knows Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country. Thursday Comics Hangover is a weekly column reviewing some of the new books that I pick up at [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/), my friendly neighborhood comic book store.
For many years, the publishers of superhero comics tried to convince their readers that it was the characters that mattered most, not the creative teams behind the characters.</description>

      <description>Our bookstore of the month for August is Mercer Street Books. You may have read Paul&amp;rsquo;s first three pieces on the store, from the previous Wednesdays of this month. He mentioned that owner Debbie Sarrow kindly agreed to be the mail-drop for SRoB, and to the cynical mind that might explain why we picked Mercer Street Books as our first pick: a little quid pro quo, right?
What it doesn&amp;rsquo;t say, though, is why we asked Debbie if she&amp;rsquo;d agree to help us in the first place.</description>

      <description>For as long as Seattle has been a city, people have come to town and people have left town. Earlier this month, the *Seattle Review of Books* introduced a feature called [Exit Interview](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/exit-interview-talking-with-kate-lebo-about-why-she-left-seattle-for-spokane/), in which we talk with an author who recently left town about their Seattle experience. The natural pair to that feature is New Hire, an interview with an author whoâs just arrived here. (If you have any suggestions for a subject of an upcoming Exit Interview or a New Hire, please [drop us a line](http://seattlereviewofbooks.</description>

Our favorite quote about this book is from Peter Geye: &amp;ldquo;If Albert Camus had written westerns, they might have sounded something like Robert James Russell&amp;rsquo;s Mesilla.&amp;rdquo; - Peter Geye&amp;rdquo;
But, we think the prose says it best:</description>

      <description>As an object, Hausfrau is unprepossessing. It eschews visual hallmarks of literary seriousness, by which I mostly mean, it looks girly. The dust jacket invites one to wrinkle her nose at its ingratiating spray of pink and purple roses floating atop a metallic plane, which, combined with the title, suggest the novel might be slumming it in the genre ghetto known as Female Complaint. And at a measly 300-ish pages, it lacks the heft of, say, the Victorians, whose prolixity goes some way with a species of modern reader toward atoning for their trivial concerns.</description>

      <description>MONDAY Elliott Bay Book Company and the Hedgebrook writing colony join forces to bring novelist Parnaz Foroutan to Seattle to read from her novel The Girl from the Garden, an Iranian family drama. Gloria Steinem gives this one a rousing blurb: âA powerful and moving novel about the devastating choices women face when their worth is tied to their wombs but not themselves. Parnaz Foroutan takes the timeless themes of love, honor, sacrifice, and betrayal, and makes them new.</description>

      <description>This year, there was a lot of angst over the Hugo Awards, the science fiction awards given out as part of the Worldcon sci-fi convention. In brief: a bunch of asshole white dudes who think women and minorities are scary and gross tried to take over the awards because they believe everything, including sci-fi, was better in the 1950s. (You can read a longer explanation at Slate).
So after much hand-wringing and a whole lot of jackasses complaining about &amp;ldquo;Social Justice Warriors&amp;rdquo; online (an aside: if you&amp;rsquo;re railing against people who fight for social justice, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re on the wrong team?</description>

      <description>Tomorrow, the Vera Project hosts the Seattle Anarchist Book Fair from 10 am to 5 pm. You&amp;rsquo;ll find over 30 tables of publishers, bookstores, magazines, and more, featuring novels and zines and cookbooks and probably board games, too. (Right? Everyone has board games nowadays.) Here&amp;rsquo;s the schedule of events, some of which might surprise those of you who have a stereotypical &amp;ldquo;anarchist&amp;rdquo; image in your head:
DOWNSTAIRS ROOM
* 10:15am - 11:30am &amp;gt; Report from Russia * 11:45am - 1:15pm &amp;gt; Hip Hop &amp;amp; Autonomy Discussion Panel * 2:00pm - 3:30pm &amp;gt; On Being A Seattleite * 3:45pm - 5:00pm &amp;gt; Queer Time Travel, by editors of Baedan</description>

      <description>Hereâs what I love about absurdism in literature: Itâs a fun way to discuss the terrible things in life. Helen Phillipsâs short and propulsive debut novel, The Beautiful Bureaucrat, is a gorgeous example of the stark and spare absurdist genre, a place most gorgeously inhabited by the Russian greats (Zamyatin, Bulgakov, Nabokov). Thereâs a love story here as big and shadowy as the one in Master and Margarita; thereâs also a deft skewering of the American job market that parallels the helplessness within Invitation to a Beheading.</description>

[Jonathan Franzen wanted to adopt an Iraqi orphan to better understand the young](http://mashable.com/2015/08/21/jonathan-franzen-iraqi-orphan/) Franzen says his editor talked him out of this plan. This is the best case for editors that I have ever read in my entire life.</description>

      <description>Local writer Anca Szilagyi just published a list of resources for people who need affordable housing options in Seattle. Szilagyi says she thinks about affordable housing, in part, &amp;ldquo;because Iâm a writer with writer and artist friends.&amp;rdquo; This is an issue we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about before in the first installment of our Exit Interview series, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be addressing it more in the future.
If you&amp;rsquo;re an artist of any sort living in Seattle right now âÂ or a bookseller, or a non-profit employee, or, really, anyone involved in the arts at all â rent is very likely at the top of your mind all the time.</description>

      <description>Rafi Schwartz at GOOD writes:
This summer, the Romanian city of Cluj-Napoca unveiled a new initiative designed to both promote literacy, and encourage residents to take advantage of municipal public transportation: From June 4-7, anyone reading on the cityâs busses, trams or trolley, was be allowed to ride, entirely free of charge. What a great idea! I&amp;rsquo;d love to see Seattle Public Library and King County Metro team up for something like this.</description>

      <description>Every comics fan knows Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country. Thursday Comics Hangover is a weekly column reviewing some of the new books that I pick up at [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/), my friendly neighborhood comic book store.
(Before we get started with the column this week, I just heard about this neat thing and I want to share it with you: The Ladies Comic Book Club, which is a comics book club for women, will be having their third meeting at Phoenix Comics tonight.</description>

Tomorrow night, the good folks behind Lit Crawl are throwing a 90&amp;rsquo;s-themed dance party at Fred Wildlife Refuge, as a way to raise money for the (entirely free) Crawl. It&amp;rsquo;s $5 at the door. As the invitation puts it:</description>

      <description>![](/webhook-uploads/1439873911990/nufer.jpg)
Doug Nufer is freed by constraints. Nearly everything written by Seattleâs most valiant bearer of the Oulipian torch is born of one constraint or another; one narrative is told through the stultifying language of corporate biography, another is an homage to old Ace Doubles genre storytelling, a third is a story told only in negatives. His newest novel, *Lifeline Rule* is a conovowel text, which is a form in which every consonant alternates with a vowel.</description>

      <description>When you ask Debbie Sarow if there are any rules that Mercer Street Books customers should keep in mind when bringing their books in to sell to the store, she bristles. She has a few basic rules for books sheâll never buy â computer books, hardback books without dust jackets â but Sarow doesnât like to discourage customers from bringing any sorts of books in, because âitâs the one book that they think is garbage that turns out to be the prize.</description>

      <description>Donât sleep in a parked car.
You awake, windows fogged, hands on the wheel,
the dash and controls suddenly foreign,
like a safe word repeated too often. What queer
drives brought you here? You hurtle ahead but the car
is still. You wake up turning the wheel
and avoiding its meaning. Turning a pink plastic wheel.
Pounding a rubber clown horn like a little girl. And harbor strange
fears of waking up driving.</description>

      <description>Fantagraphics author Ed Piskor announced this morning on Facebook that the rights for his wonderful comic book about the history of hip hop, Hip Hop Family Tree, have been sold to Hollywood. Specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s in development as an animated series, and Piskor assures his fans that it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;not one of those dime-a-dozen &amp;lsquo;options&amp;rsquo; you hear about,&amp;rdquo; meaning there&amp;rsquo;s real progress underway.
Is this the first time a Fantagraphics comic has ever been adapted into an animated series, or am I forgetting about a canceled attempt at a Love &amp;amp; Rockets TV show?</description>

      <description>A friend who works at the Library of Congress occasionally gets called on to give tours to visiting school groups. The kids respond like most kids would at a government institution: long, bored faces. Not even the gilded grandeur of the building holds much sway.
He takes them to the Gutenberg Bible, laying prone in a glass case, opened to whatever page the curator deemed worthy. This is one of the finest existing copies of the rarest, most valuable book in the world.</description>

      <description>MONDAY Our week starts off with the August edition of Nerd Nite at Lucid Jazz Lounge. As with every Nerd Nite, this one features two very different speakers. First up, Marielle Saums will discuss the history of bananas. Then, electrical engineer Krunal Desai, who press materials inform us âbailed on the auto industry to work on spacecraft,â will discuss why modern cars are so difficult to fix but so easy to hack.</description>

      <description>Our thanks to sponsor Darin Bradley for his support over the past week. One reviewer said this about his novel Chimpanzee âSo if you took Twelve Monkeys, add The Time Travelerâs Wife but subtract the time-travel, multiply by 1984, factor in Strange Days and divide by Fight Club, you get Chimpanzee.â
The Seattle Review of Books relies on sponorships to bring you poems, interviews, reviews, notes, and advice every week. Go read a chapter from Chimpanzee, and if you like it, consider picking up a copy and telling him you heard about it here.</description>

 In the 42 years I have worked full timeâday in, day outâas a writer, producing, so far, 15 books (a couple of memoirs, a collection of essays and a bunch of novels). I have made it onto The New York Times list for a lifetime total of four weeksâback when the movie version of my novel Labor Day sent the novel that inspired it very briefly onto the charts.</description>

      <description>Ask any writer: the two most difficult parts of the writing process are **1)** sitting down in the seat to write and **2)** figuring out what to write about. We *can&#39;t* help you focus on your work, but we *can* try to help you find inspiration in the city around you. That&#39;s what Seattle Writing Prompts is all about. These prompts are offered free to anyone who needs them; all the *Seattle Review of Books* asks in return is that you thank us in the acknowledgements when you turn it into a book.</description>

**Dear Cienna,**
Is dog-earing the pages of a book morally, ethically, or spiritually wrong? What about underlining?
**Brooke from Capitol Hill**
Dear Brooke,
In a world where Ted Nugent, Donald Trump, and Mark Driscoll can all boast of being New York Times bestselling authors, I have a hard time labeling anything short of a ham sandwich wrapped in pages of the Koran as morally, ethically, or spiritually wrong (especially if the infidel sandwich is thrown its own ticker-tape parade in Mecca during Ramadan).</description>

There was no return address, and it wasnât signed. It was a very short message on a note card telling us that we had lost a customer. In it, the person said we **stoked the flames of enmity between races and promoted division**.</description>

      <description>Vendetta, the new book by Seattle Times writer James Neff, begins on the day that many have characterized as the moment when America lost its innocence. Attorney General Robert Kennedy has just enjoyed a picnic lunch on an unseasonably warm November day in Washington DC. Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa is finishing a meal in a Miami restaurant. Both men are approached with news: President John F. Kennedy has been shot; heâs likely either dead or is about to die.</description>

First issues of comic series are tough. You have to establish a premise, introduce readers to at least one character to care about, and then give the readers a good reason to come back for the second issue.</description>

      <description>GoodReads just put up a blog post about the stunning success of Paula Hawkins&amp;rsquo;s thriller The Girl on the Train. If you&amp;rsquo;re into metrics, this will fascinate you. If you&amp;rsquo;re a big believer in the power of reviews â as I am â it will affirm your worldview in a satisfying way. And that&amp;rsquo;s what the internet is all about, right? Affirming your worldview in a satisfying way?
Also satisfying: the post&amp;rsquo;s comment section, which is mostly full of people who, like me, thought The Girl on the Train was an unremarkable thriller.</description>

Though Debbie Sarow never imagined herself as a small business owner, her days as a bookseller were punctuated with little fantasies about what she would do if she ever ran her own bookstore.
One example comes immediately to mind. âI decided early on that if I had my way, I would put the graphic novels next to the art books,â Sarow tells me. âEverybody puts the graphic novels next to the humor books,â she says, presumably because humor books are often profusely illustrated.</description>

      <description>Caleb Crain&amp;rsquo;s piece for the Atlantic on Purity bears a salacious headline â &amp;ldquo;Jonathan Franzen Strikes Again: His latest targets: web sleuths and feminists&amp;rdquo; â but it&amp;rsquo;s really just one of those pre-publication book reviews that kind of gives out way too much information about the book. You can expect all kinds of clickbait-y headlines in the next few weeks, now that Franzen&amp;rsquo;s back in town.
Honestly, I haven&amp;rsquo;t decided whether I&amp;rsquo;m going to read Purity or not; there are so many great books by non-Franzens out there just waiting to be read, and I was underwhelmed both by Freedom and by Franzen&amp;rsquo;s last Seattle appearance.</description>

      <description>For many years if you attended a reading in Seattle, you&#39;d have a pretty good chance of running into [Kate Lebo](http://katelebo.com/) there. The author of *Pie School: Lessons in Fruit, Flour, and Butter* and *A Commonplace Book of Pie*, Lebo is a poet and an essayist who&#39;s read on pretty much every stage in Seattle. But unlike a lot of writers who only show up when they&#39;re on the bill, she&#39;s always been a full participant in Seattle&#39;s literary scene, too.</description>

      <description>We celebrated our distance from New York,
high-fived each other as our words
debuted in Open Books and Floating Bridge,
Elliott Bay, and the daze of The Typing Explosion.
Thatâs what they will call us you predicted
as we stood on the edge of Summit Avenue
near Broadway, The Seattle School, while the newfangled
streetlight wandered in and out of power.
We were younger then, with little idea
of poetry schools, just a sense of the work we revered:</description>

      <description>We love Greenwood&amp;rsquo;s literary tutoring center The Bureau of Fearless Ideas (formerly known as 826 Seattle) and we are big fans of this Facebook post demonstrating a recent student experiment in creating illuminated manuscripts. It seems as though, with the general-interest acceptance of comic books, we&amp;rsquo;re about due for an illuminated manuscript resurgence. Maybe one of these kids will lead the charge.</description>

      <description>Fantagraphics has one of the best design departments in the history of publishing. Their willingness to work the form to the content, rather than the other way around, pays great dividends for book lovers. Often overlooked because the content they are publishing is super-graphic in of itself (comics), their design is eye-catching and functional, while often elevating the text; their materials, paper, binding, and just the feel of their books in your hand is always considered.</description>

      <description>Our thanks to this week&amp;rsquo;s sponsor Darin Bradley. One reviewer said this about his novel Chimpanzee âSo if you took Twelve Monkeys, add The Time Travelerâs Wife but subtract the time-travel, multiply by 1984, factor in Strange Days and divide by Fight Club, you get Chimpanzee.â
The Seattle Review of Books relies on sponorships to bring you poems, interviews, reviews, notes, and advice every week. Go read a chapter from Chimpanzee, and if you like it, consider picking up a copy and telling him you heard about it hear.</description>

      <description>[How to spot whodunnit: academics crack Agatha Christie&#39;s code](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/02/academics-unlock-formula-agatha-christies-mysteries) At the bequest of television channel, a group of academics looked at Agatha Christie&amp;rsquo;s work, and developed formulas to reveal the patterns within.
 Many of the results concerned the gender of the killer. For example, they found that if the victim was strangled, the killer was more likely to be male (or male with a female accomplice), whereas if the setting was a country house â not uncommon for a Christie novel â there was a 75% chance the killer would be female.</description>

      <description>Our sincerest thanks to Janine A. Southard for sponsoring The Seattle Review of Books this week. Sponsorships are very important to us. Why? Because internet advertising is horrible and we&amp;rsquo;re trying to do something about it.
So, instead, we offer a full chapter from Southard&amp;rsquo;s hilarious, and well-loved Cracked! A Magic iPhone Story (four stars on Amazon!) book. The award-winning Southard (a Seattle denizen) shows you how the geeks of Seattle live, provides a running and often-hilarious social commentary on todayâs world, and reminds you that, so long as you have friends, you are never alone.</description>

      <description>Five years ago, I reviewed David Lipskyâs book Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself: A Road Trip with David Foster Wallace. Itâs an account, published just a year or so after Wallaceâs death, of Lipskyâs days-long Rolling Stone interview with Wallace at the end of his Infinite Jest reading tour. Hereâs the nut of the review:
Unfortunately, it&#39;s a bad book, a mass of Lipsky&#39;s notes and personal recollections that he never successfully structured into something useful.</description>

      <description>Last month, I wrote about why I&amp;rsquo;m not reading Go Set a Watchman. (Short version: &amp;ldquo;Iâd just rather not have to write a negative review of a Harper Lee book.&amp;rdquo;) If you want to read the book, that&amp;rsquo;s your prerogative, of course. And if you want to slag the book without reading it, that&amp;rsquo;s your right as an American, too. But I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel that this news falls less on the side of a natural response to Go Set a Watchman and more on the side of a publicity stunt:</description>

**Dear Cienna,**
** I recently read an article proving that publishers are more interested in novels submitted under male names. My novel has been rejected by several agents for being too âweird and creepy,â and I canât help but wonder if theyâd have the same criticism if the same book had a male name on it.</description>

      <title>Saying goodbye to a secret bookstore</title>

      <description>Brazenhead Books in Manhattan has closed. Most of us never went there &amp;mdash; it was an illegal store. Access, and the address, were shared amongst insiders. âThe secret was known to a small number of discreet patrons and shared strictly by word of mouth,â says Brian Patrick Eha, in a bittersweet New Yorker article about the store, and its owner Michael Seidenberg.
I love the romantic idea of these secret hidden places â so long as Iâm on the inside, of course (sucks to not know).</description>

      <description>Usually, this column is about new comics I bought on Wednesday. But last night I went to a press screening for the Fantastic Four movie that opens tomorrow, and I want to talk about that for a bit instead. (If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a straight-up movie review, you can read my review at Prairie Dog.)
The first 102 issues of the Fantastic Four by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee are basically the template for every adventure comic book that came after: big sci-fi ideas, big discoveries, comic relief, and personal drama.</description>

      <description>KING 5&amp;rsquo;s New Day NW interviewed local writers Anca Szilagyi and Erin Malone about the very worthy Jack Straw Writers Program. (I&amp;rsquo;d embed the video here, but in my experience KING 5&amp;rsquo;s video viewer tends to make websites shiver, roll over, and die. You&amp;rsquo;re better off just clicking through and viewing it on their own site.) The interview also discusses Hugo House, and it promotes a Jack Straw reading that happens tonight at Elliott Bay Book Company.</description>

      <description>You may have noticed that we do things a little differently around here. We don&amp;rsquo;t have ads like most websites. Instead of irrelevant, slow, bloated, and often weirdly offensive ads on the site, we have sponsorships. Instead of repeated images of that one product you looked at once that follows you around the internet like a ghost, or scammy computer fix-it ads that have nothing to do with books, we&amp;rsquo;re offering you something that we know you love: reading.</description>

      <description>This New York Times obituary for the Cold War historian makes him so easy to like. Conquest was a poet and a fan of science fiction, and he once responded to liberal criticism with a historical limerick:
There was a great Marxist called Lenin
Who did two or three million men in.
Thatâs a lot to have done in,
But where he did one in
That grand Marxist Stalin did ten in.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s the way it works: we reach out to a poet and ask for a selection of poems to look over. We work with the poet to select the poem that&amp;rsquo;s right for SRoB. We then publish the poem and pay the poet for their work.</description>

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of yellowjackets, stinging
nettles, and jellyjars filled with broken glass.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is not for the cottonhearted.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is for the man who holds fire
between his fingers and calls it love.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We are burnt
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;toast and prism jam.
We are rubbing ourselves
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;with the underside of a fern
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;trying to make the stinging stop.
There are remedies everywhereâ</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a two-year appointment, and it pays $10,000. (Hooray for paying writers for their work!) Our newest Civic Poet is Claudia Castro Luna.</description>

      <description>Lisa Peet at Library Journal writes about some disappointing new Harris poll results:
In 2011, 18 percent of adults surveyed answered yes to the question âDo you think that there are any books which should be banned completely?â In the most current study, published July 8, 28 percent answered the same question in the affirmativeâa ten point increaseâwith 24 percent of those surveyed unsure. This means nearly half of those surveyed are still convinced that no books should ever be banned, but the implications of the findings still deserve attention.</description>

Palmerâs actions inspired the internet to recoil in outrage; he was doxxed almost immediately and had to go into hiding when people began plastering the front of his business with shaming messages and threats.</description>

      <description>MONDAY August can be a challenging month for readings in Seattle. Now that weâre in August, Town Hall is shuttered for a month for its yearly schedule of renovations âÂ you canât keep a place that old looking that good without a whole lot of TLC âÂ and other readings series choke back on their offerings. So maybe itâs time to check in on some old faithful institutions, like Works in Progress, the Hugo Houseâs twice-monthly reading series.</description>

[The Last Days of Kathy Acker](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/hazlitt/feature/last-days-kathy-acker) Her books were also fever dreams of escape and reinvention, and Ackerâs own forbidding physical appearanceâshe could look, alternately, like a deranged kewpie doll, a pirate from the future, an alien courtesanâembodied such transformations. She spent years turning her body, simultaneously a source of pain and possibility in her work and life, into a protective carapace. [Reverse Logic](http://unabridged.</description>

      <description>Every day, friend of the *SRoB* Rahawa Haile tweets a short story. She gave us permission to collect them every week.
And, this week, [Kevin Nguyen](https://twitter.com/knguyen) interviewed her about the project in the [Oyster Review](https://review.oysterbooks.com/p/TX8YT7y6m8cyRZxRoniuiG/one-short-story-every-day). (itâs worth reading the whole thing for her last line, but this quote here is pretty choice, too).
I am highlighting a short story every day by authors who arenât white men because âdiversity mattersâ deserves to be more than sentiment.</description>

**Dear Cienna,**
My boyfriend and I are moving in together next week. I&amp;rsquo;m very excited about this, and I&amp;rsquo;m confident it&amp;rsquo;s the right move. But we just had our first fight over a moving issue, and it&amp;rsquo;s something I feel very strongly about: he wants to merge our book collections together.</description>

      <description>Short Run, the great small-press festival that local author Kelly Froh co-founded, is running a comics summer school every Monday night in August, with classes including how to computerize your art, screen printing, inking, watercolor, and drawing perspective. Each class is very affordable (Short Run is charging anywhere on a sliding scale from five to 20 dollars per class) and hosted by local cartooning greats including Eroyn Franklin, Robyn Jordan, and Max Clotfelter.</description>

      <description>Ask any writer: the two most difficult parts of the writing process are **1)** sitting down in the seat to write and **2)** figuring out what to write about. We *can&#39;t* help you focus on your work, but we *can* try to help you find inspiration in the city around you. That&#39;s what Seattle Writing Prompts is all about. These prompts are offered free to anyone who needs them; all the *Seattle Review of Books* asks in return is that you thank us in the acknowledgements when you turn it into a book.</description>

      <description>Webcomics are great, but minicomics are satisfying in a way that webcomics will never be able to duplicate. A hand-folded minicomic, especially one still warm from the photocopier, is as intimate and organic as a handwritten letter from a good friend. You can understand why cartoonists made the move from minicomics to webcomics â unlimited distribution, no paper cuts â but you can also understand why some artists still prefer working with ink and paper.</description>

      <description>The New Statesman interview with sci-fi great Michael Moorcock is absolutely worth reading, if just for all the punches thrown. Some quoteworthy moments:
Who really cares about spaceships and how rockets work? I donât actually care about space at all. You had to plough through all this shit that people like Arthur [C Clarke] insisted on expositing to get to maybe five good images. and

The general consensus is that we need to detoxify the Webâto make it a cleaner, nicer, safer, and more inclusive place to live and work. Of course, at the *Daily Dot*, we would like to see a more civil, compassionate Web, but we want to be careful that in the name of fostering civility, we do not inadvertently kill all dissention.</description>

      <description>KING 5 is reporting that local true crime writer Ann Rule has died. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never read The Stranger Beside Me, about Rule&amp;rsquo;s personal relationship with serial killer Ted Bundy, you really should. It&amp;rsquo;s far and away her best book, and a classic of the true crime genre.
I wrote a snarky overview of Rule&amp;rsquo;s writing back when I was the new kid at The Stranger, and while I regret the tone of the piece âÂ I was so much younger then!</description>

Titled â[Books about women donât win big awards: some data](http://nicolagriffith.com/2015/05/26/books-about-women-tend-not-to-win-awards/),â Griffith presented a number of striking charts demonstrating the gender split between winners of awards like the Pulitzer Prize, the Man Booker, the National Book Award, and the Newbery Medal over the last 15 years. Unsurprisingly, more men than women have won almost all of those awards.</description>

Tuesday: The Literary Mixer, a monthly happy hour event, has been going on for a couple years now. (It started at Vermillion, but the event moved to the Hideout not so long ago.) The concept behind Literary Mixer is as simple and clear as the name of the event: bring the book youâre currently reading to the bar.</description>

&amp;mdash; Jim Henley (@UOJim) July 26, 2015 Those only familiar with Watchmen through Zack Snyderâs visually slavish but emotionally hollow cinematic adaptation might not get the irony here. Rorschach was created by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons in the 1980s as an echo of the Steve Ditko character The Question. Ditko is a famous Objectivist, one who believes that heroic fiction should only follow the rules established by Ayn Rand in her fiction and essays.</description>

      <description>_(A collection of pieces we noted this week.)_
[Joe Gould&#39;s Teeth](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/joe-goulds-teeth) Jill Lepore writes in The New Yorker about the longest book ever written, and whether or not it actually existed.
There ought to be a âDangerâ sign. Writers tumble into this story, and then they plummet. I have always supposed this to be because Gould suffered from hypergraphia. He could not stop writing. This is an illness, a mania, but seems more like something a writer might envy, which feels even rottener than envy usually does, because Gould was a toothless madman who slept in the street.</description>

      <description>Hugo House is hosting a one-day poetry broadside workshop Saturday August 8, run by local poet J.T. Stewart, and master typographer John D. Berry. Poets will walk away with printed broadsides of their work.
Broadsides were once the currency of the poetry underground. Learning how to design and print them is a great opportunity, especially if you&amp;rsquo;ve never seen your work come to life on paper right before your eyes. Having this level of experience and guidance available to you is a rare opportunity.</description>

      <description>Holy cow, this story has exploded in such a weird way.
Founder Nick Denton plans to relaunch [Gawker], which has been publishing fewer stories since the scandal began, with a heightened focus on **newsworthiness over salaciousness**, according to a report from Digiday. He told staffers at a Thursday meeting the new Gawker.com would be &#34;20 percent nicer&#34; than its previous iteration, Capital New York reported. Also, Gawker&amp;rsquo;s parent company, Gawker Media, might be changing its name to distance itself from the Gawker brand.</description>

      <description>Dennis Abrams of Publishing Perspectives writes:
Opening this September is the Book and Bed, a new hotel located in Tokyoâs Ikebukuro neighborhood, that, according to Rocket News 24, literally âinvites bibliophiles to sleep in the stacks.â They can&amp;rsquo;t promise privacy, but they can promise the opportunity to fall asleep while doing something you love. This is not your only opportunity to sleep in a bookstore: Abrams writes, &amp;ldquo;In Paris, if youâre willing to volunteer time, you can crash at Shakespeare &amp;amp; Co.</description>

      <description>The Academy (as in, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank the&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;) posted this interactive interview with screenwriter John August. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to think of a better advocate for screenwriters than he. Not only has he been answering questions from readers on his blog since for at least fifteen years (well before he was as well-known as he is now), but after falling in hate with the biggest screenwriting software out there, he helped to create an open source plaintext screenwriting standard called Fountain, and then he started a software company to make software to utilize it.</description>

      <description>(*Every comics fan knows that Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country.* Thursday Comics Hangover *is a weekly column reviewing some of the new books that I pick up at [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/), my friendly neighborhood comic book store.*)
I swear every month brings a new comic series about a paranormal investigator. It&#39;s one of the most overplayed ideas out there â a down-on-his-luck detective who bumps into demons or vampires or some other creature-of-the-week riff.</description>

      <description>Houstonia magazine responds perfectly to racist readers who complained about an advertisement depicting a mixed-race family. Sometimes the customer is not right. Sometimes the customer is a bigot. In times like that, it&amp;rsquo;s okay to call them out on their bigotry, and to tell them they are not welcome to read the publication anymore. The quality of your readers definitely makes a statement about your publication. In fact, it says a lot more about your publication than the quantity of readers.</description>

      <description>In a three-decade career Moore refined the Archie Comics visual vocabulary, creating arguably the most iconic take on a set of characters who are now recognized all over the world. The (very good) recent attempt to modernize Archie couldn&amp;rsquo;t exist without the sturdy foundations that Moore built.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not every day this kind of historical investigation happens, especially in a relatively new city like Seattle: Seattle Pacific University is home to 43 letters written by John Newton, the slave trader who eventually became an abolitionist. Newton is perhaps best known as the writer of the song &amp;ldquo;Amazing Grace,&amp;rdquo; which is one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Newton was &amp;ldquo;part of &amp;lsquo;a loose but extensive network of late-18th- and early-19th-century British evangelicals including William Wilberforce who corresponded and collaborated on the effort to abolish slavery throughout the Empire.</description>

      <description>The author of Ragtime has died. He was 84. The first Doctorow book I read was his 2004 novel The March, a story of Sherman&amp;rsquo;s March which ended with a truly horrific scene that sticks with me to this day. I then went back to Ragtime and and Billy Bathgate. Historical fiction is so tough to get right, and Doctorow was a master at it; he never deluged you with details and look-at-my-research flourishes.</description>

      <description>The Seattle Review of Books is officially an endorser of the city&amp;rsquo;s bid to become designated a UNESCO City of Literature. This is because we believe Seattle is a world-class book city, and the designation would allow us to share our art with other UNESCO Creative Cities around the world. Additionally, if we earned the designation, the city would establish an office to oversee the city&amp;rsquo;s literary scene, which could create some exceptional opportunities for collaboration and community outreach.</description>

      <description>Back in 2008, Screenwriter Todd Alcott looked at a rather unique publishing oddity from the 1970s &amp;mdash; a book-length marriage proposal to consumer advocate Ralph Nader. These days, we&amp;rsquo;d call it stalking, but in those days the author Amy Devereaux, after her many letters went ignored, published her 165-page proposal (literally titled Ralph Nader Will You Marry Me?) in a form that can only be called &amp;ldquo;epistolary plus&amp;rdquo;. It contained letters, songs, stories, poems, and a musical play titled Passionate Purple to Ralph Nader, a musical play.</description>

      <description>Specificity is the key for understanding broader truths. Itâs only when we really drill down on a subject that we uncover metaphors that apply to other situations. To a lazy thinker, a rock is just a rock. To a geologist, a rock is a gateway to understanding the world, a subject dense with hidden secrets that affect everything else on earth.
In her book We Should All Be Feminists, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie digs into the idea of feminism and she uncovers some realizations that simply should not be as surprising as they are:</description>

Heâs working on a particularly tricky case â an old friend, an affable writer of boring technical articles, has had his life threatened for mysterious reasons â and at every turn Braggâs past confronts him. Heâs far away from his home in San Francisco, his ex-wife is putting the moves on him, and his own childhood keeps creeping into his peripheral vision.</description>

      <description>For the last twelve hours or so, the internet has been railing against Gawker for publishing a post that allegedly outed a non-public figure, a man married to a woman, for trying to hire a male escort. This is, of course, a dumb and wrong post for Gawker to publish. Full stop. There&amp;rsquo;s no hypocrisy to unveil, no Republican moral double-back-flips to disprove in this story. Some guy has a social life that other people might describe as screwed-up.</description>

      <description>Marvel Comics recently announced they were publishing hip-hop themed covers on all their books in October. This launched a conversation about the fact that Marvel doesn&amp;rsquo;t hire people of color to write their books, which kind of makes this whole hip-hop cover thing smack of appropriation.
Comics critic David Brothers wrote an excellent long Tumblr post about why people of color are unhappy about this cover tribute, and you should read the whole thing.</description>

      <description>For a while there in 2009, reporting on books and publishing basically involved firing up the old internet-box on a daily basis and looking around to see which magazines were going out of business. Thankfully that crisis has passed, but we still lose good magazines every now and again. National Journal&amp;rsquo;s print publication is going under at the end of this year; the publisher says &amp;ldquo;News in DC now moves too quickly for a weekly publication.</description>

      <description>(*Every comics fan knows that Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country. Thursday Comics Hangover is a weekly column reviewing some of the new books that I pick up at Phoenix Comics, my friendly neighborhood comic book store*.)
![Island](/webhook-uploads/1437023872702/Island01-900px-276da.jpg)
Serialized anthology comics are tough. Theyâre a pain to coordinate, for starters, and itâs hard to find an audience for a series of short, ongoing stories by a wide array of artists.</description>

      <description>Cartoonist Matt Bors just announced that his online cartooning hub The Nib has parted ways with blogging site Medium. Of the split with Medium, Bors simply says &amp;ldquo;our ambitions diverged,&amp;rdquo; and he promises that &amp;ldquo;I donât think it will be long until I have something to announce&amp;rdquo; in terms of The Nib finding a new home. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope not; The Nib has been publishing some great comics on a regular basis and in its short year and a half of existence, it became a destination for those in search of good comics on the web.</description>

      <description>Today, in case you can&amp;rsquo;t tell from the flurry of posts on the internet and on this site, is the official release day of the To Kill a Mockingbird sequel/prequel. If you&amp;rsquo;re frustrated by the overkill, I promise it will all be over tomorrow. But until then, Quartz has discovered that significant portions of Watchman very closely resemble significant portions of Mockingbird. Of course, self-plagiarism is no crime â and by all accounts, Watchman was an early draft of Mockingbird, which explains the overlap â but it again raises the question of why Watchman even exists.</description>

      <description>The famous opening sentence of Anna Karenina âÂ &amp;rdquo;Happy families are all alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own wayâ â has been overused to the point of meaninglessness, like a word spoken aloud again and again until it becomes an oddity, stripped of its definition and reduced to a few ugly, alien syllables. The sentence is now a cliche that many people interpret as a license to spray their dysfunctional family history everywhere, in the form of memoir and Facebook post and standup routine.</description>

      <description>Republican presidential candidate/human idea toilet Ted Cruz just published a new memoir to promote his presidential campaign. The New York Times refused to put the book on its bestseller list, saying its sales numbers were inflated due to &amp;ldquo;strategic bulk purchases.&amp;rdquo; Now Amazon and the book&amp;rsquo;s publisher, Harper Collins, are both defending Cruz, saying they see no sign of bulk purchases.
I mean, the dirty secret of all bestselling political books is that they&amp;rsquo;re manipulated by bulk purchases.</description>

      <description>While everyone in Seattle is currently freaking out about Kathryn Schulz&amp;rsquo;s excellent New Yorker article detailing how we we&amp;rsquo;re overdue for an impossibly bad earthquake, I&amp;rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to remind you to read Sandi Doughton&amp;rsquo;s excellent Full-Rip 9.0: The Next Big Earthquake in the Pacific Northwest. Doughton gets into detail that the New Yorker simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t have room for, explaining all the various fault lines and different kinds of earthquakes that could strike Seattle in specific and the Pacific Northwest in general.</description>

      <description>MONDAY: Elliott Bay Book Company hosts Seattle Times reporter James Neff, who debuts his new historical account, Vendetta: Bobby Kennedy Versus Jimmy Hoffa. This oneâs got some good blurbs. Seymour Hersh says, âThis is not a book about a good Bobby versus a bad Hoffa. It is a study of two men who always got what they wanted staging a shootout on the streets of Laredo. And, as Neff tells it, there were no winners.</description>

      <description>Kurt Vonnegut was mortified by the idea of being considered a sci-fi author. You have to understand, this was a different time, before Michael Chabon and Haruki Murakami and Kelly Link started blurring the lines between literary fiction and genre. The âscience fictionâ classification used to mean an author would be stigmatized to the gaudy corner of bookstores where only children and misfits would browse, so you can forgive Vonnegut a little bit of grumpiness over an imaginary distinction.</description>

      <description>The Guardian just published the first chapter of Harper Lee&amp;rsquo;s second novel, Go Set a Watchman, on a page loaded with animation and &amp;ldquo;ambient sound&amp;rdquo; and an audio version of the text read by Reese Witherspoon. It positively reeks of overkill. And how&amp;rsquo;s the chapter? As you may have expected, it&amp;rsquo;s really not very good; some of the writing is painfully awkward.

      <description>Speaking of comics, I barely pay attention to the news that comes out of San Diego Comicon these days because it&amp;rsquo;s become a big Hollywood PR machine. But the SDCC news that DC Comics&amp;rsquo; adult/creator-owned imprint Vertigo is launching 12 new titles this fall is very welcome. Vertigo used to publish wonderful comics series on a regular basis, but it&amp;rsquo;s fallen into disrepair over the last decade or so. Some of these names â Darwyn Cooke!</description>

      <description>I reviewed Ernest Cline&amp;rsquo;s sci-fi novel Ready Player One on its release. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it. The book&amp;rsquo;s boundless nostalgia for 80s nerd culture unsettled me on a deep level; hating the book kind of felt like self-loathing. In retrospect, I admit that my review of the book wasn&amp;rsquo;t very good â I couldn&amp;rsquo;t convey what I disliked about Ready Player One because I was wrestling with the issue of my generation&amp;rsquo;s nostalgia on a personal level.</description>

The Seattle Review of Books will launch our readings calendar in the fall. (These things take time to do right!) But until that happens, every Monday weâll highlight the best readings/literary events/talks/book clubs happening in Seattle â one event for each day of the week. (The above photo is of local author Doug Nufer and his dog. Nufer is on the right.)
Monday: The week opens on a promising note as Seattleâs literary godmother, Nancy Pearl, appears in conversation with the novelist Mary Doria Russell at University Book Store.</description>

      <description>Is literature a conversation or a monologue? Is it possible that the majority of all conversations are just twinned monologues, skating by the ears of their intended targets and firing off into the void in opposite directions? Nearly everyone has been seated in a restaurant near an awkward first date where the conversation, despite both participantsâ best efforts, ranges more toward masturbation than copulation. But what if that scenario is the norm, rather than an awkward rarity?</description>

      <description>A couple weeks ago, I visited the delightful Phinney Books for a reading. Customers at Phinney Books always have huge smiles plastered across their faces, and when you walk in, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand why: from the categorization of books as either &amp;ldquo;TRUE&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;MADE UP&amp;rdquo; to the giant Ferris wheel along the wall of the kids&amp;rsquo; section, the whole store seems designed to maximize happiness in humans.
In preparation for the store&amp;rsquo;s upcoming one-year anniversary, owner Tom Nissley was talking up a neat new idea: he had recently purchased a Polaroid camera (or whatever they call cameras that take instant photos nowadays; Polaroid got out of the Polaroid business a few years ago) and he was taking photographs of Phinney Books customers holding their favorite books.</description>

      <description>This headline from Consumerist says it all: &amp;ldquo;Amazon Will Reportedly Pay Self-Published E-Book Authors $.006 Per Page Read.&amp;rdquo;
According to the *Guardian*, that means the payments received by authors could be as little as $0.006 per page read, estimating that if an author publishes a 220-page book each page would have to be read by every person who downloads the book in order for the writer to make the $1.30 they get under the previous pay-per-download payment system.</description>

      <description>![Elissa Washuta at Hugo House, July 1, 2005](/webhook-uploads/1435818070982/elissawashuta.jpg)
âMy eating has been disordered for as long as I can remember,â Elissa Washuta said last night by way of introduction at the launch party for her second memoir, Starvation Mode. The Hugo House was sweltering, but the audience focused on every single word with a surprising acuity. Itâs usually hard to get audiences at July readings to focus on anything more than a dirty joke, but Washuta speaks with such intensity that even the sweatiest, most overdressed person in the room â hi there â couldnât allow his attention to drift if he wanted to.</description>

      <description>The Hugo House has announced its 2015-2016 season, and it&amp;rsquo;s a stellar lineup, featuring terrific big-name writers like Jonathan Lethem, Heidi Julavits, Dinaw Mengestu, Maggie Nelson, and Susan Orlean paired with some of the best local writers in the business today, including Maged Zaher, Sarah Galvin, and Sierra Nelson.
Novelist Peter Mountford took the helm as the House&amp;rsquo;s curator a while ago, and this lineup feels like a manifesto. Or more accurately, as Hugo House prepares for a massive demolition and construction project, it&amp;rsquo;s more of a statement of purpose.</description>

      <description>On some whiteboard at Scribd, there is a chart of the amount of reading a particular genre lover does, compared to the overall cost of keeping books of that genre stocked.
Romance readers found themselves on the wrong side of that line, by actually taking advantage of the service as advertised.</description>

      <description>Seattle Mystery Bookshop has announced that their co-founder, William D. Farley, passed away on Sunday, June 28th, &amp;ldquo;just three days short of the shopâs 25th birthday.&amp;rdquo; Our thoughts are with the staff of Seattle Mystery Bookshop at what must be a tremendously difficult time. What a legacy, though! The store he helped found is keeping a proud tradition of Pioneer Square bookshops alive.</description>

      <description>It is taken as accepted knowledge that Neal Stephenson writes dissatisfying endings to his books. I mentioned to an internet chat room I was reading Seveneves, and this was brought up four times by four separate people. For an insult, it lays bare a tremendous compliment: only a widely read author could inspire such a trope or cliche. Itâs a signifier of prestige, in its own way.
It also shows what type of people are reading you.</description>

      <description>The governor of my native state of Maine, Paul LePage, is unequivocally an imbecile. He&amp;rsquo;s combative and unempathetic and ignorant and proud of it. He says terrible things on a very regular basis. But his most recent gaffe, as explained in the Portland Press Herald, is particularly troubling:
Gov. Paul LePageâs joke about **shooting a political cartoonist** is falling flat. The governor was laughing when he made the remark after the teenage son of *Bangor Daily News* cartoonist George Danby asked what LePage thought of his fatherâs satirical cartoons.</description>

      <description>If you ever wanted to learn what the process of recording an audio book is like, Judy Oldfield Wilson&amp;rsquo;s interview with Kathleen Wilhoite about the recording of the audio version of Where&amp;rsquo;d You Go, Bernadette is fascinating stuff. Bernadette was Wilhoite&amp;rsquo;s first book recording experience â she was enlisted by Bernadette author Maria Semple for the job â and by all accounts, she nailed it.</description>

      <description>Is it presumptuous to say that book covers are on the whole better now â more attractive, more informative, less clichÃ©d â than at any other time in history? I believe that to be true, but I&amp;rsquo;m probably setting myself up for some epic arguments in the near future. Still, this retrospective on the life and work of H. Lawrence Hoffman inspires no small amount of nostalgia for the boom days of paperback books.</description>

      <title>The (comfy, inviting) death of newspapers</title>

      <description>Design Milk published a photo-heavy tour of the Press Hotel, a new boutique hotel constructed from the old Portland Press Herald newspaper building in Portland, Maine. It&amp;rsquo;s a little too precious â my heart hurts to see perfectly good typewriters used as decoration â but on the whole it&amp;rsquo;s a gorgeous, writerly space. Maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll offer a writer-in-residence program? Those writing desks look particularly welcoming.</description>

      <title>The case against Ayn Rand</title>

      <description>â[Ayn] Randâs fans are rarely the sort of intrepid, self-reliant, go-it-alone entrepreneurial heroes she writes about,â Michael Goodwin explains in the introduction to Darryl Cunninghamâs new graphic novel The Age of Selfishness. Goodwin continues:
Rather, theyâve typically spent their lives in the comfortable embrace of large institutions, going from school to university to corporation, or from think tank to government and back again. If Paul Ryanâa government bureaucrat if ever there was oneâloves reading about [*Atlas Shrugged* protagonists] John Galt and Hank Rearden, itâs because he doesnât resemble them at all.</description>

      <description>The old joke goes that the first book Johannes Gutenberg published on his brand-new press was the Bible, but the second book he published was about the death of the publishing industry. Like most of the jokes old booksellers tell one another to pass the time, itâs not funny but itâs got a sick tinge of truth to it; my two decades in the book business as a bookseller and a critic has spanned at least five distinct deaths of the publishing industry.</description>
