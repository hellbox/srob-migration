<p><em>Lincoln in the Bardo</em>, George Saunders&rsquo;s debut novel, has <a href="http://themanbookerprize.com/news/lincoln-bardo-wins-2017-man-booker-prize">won the Man Booker Prize</a>. If you&rsquo;ve already read <em>Lincoln in the Bardo</em>, I recommend you <a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9780553397581-lincoln-in-the-bardo">check out the audio book</a>, which features an all-star cast including David Sedaris and Nick Offerman as a pair of mismatched spectral friends. I&rsquo;ve listened to the book twice now, and I keep finding new things to enjoy. It&rsquo;s like an old-timey radio drama about Abraham Lincoln and sacrifice and what it means to embrace your mortality.</p>
