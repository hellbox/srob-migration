<li><p>Hollow Earth Radio has announced the lineup for this year&rsquo;s Magma Fest, their monthlong music festival. Why is this the top news item on a book-related website? Because they&rsquo;re hosting at least two book-centric events in this year&rsquo;s Magma Fest. On March 13th, Sara Century is presenting a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/796312913806897/">lecture on the history of LGBT characters in comics</a> and Babel/Salvage is presenting the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/561968787291416/">Glossophonic Showcase</a>&rdquo; on March 25th, featuring readings from Kreg Hasegawa, Lauren Ireland, Sue Landers, and experimental musicians.</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of Hollow Earth Radio and literature, Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore&rsquo;s story from the Furnace Reading Series on HER, &ldquo;The Freezer Door,&rdquo; is now available on SoundCloud:</p></li>

<li><p>Submissions for local literary magazine <em>The Raven Chronicles</em> <a href="http://www.ravenchronicles.org/submit/">open tomorrow</a>. Your editors will be Matt Briggs for fiction, Dana Dickerson for non-fiction submissions, and Rebecca Mabanglo-Mayor for poetry.</p></li>

<li><p>You have no doubt heard about the Vancouver, BC, serial killer who <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/worst-serial-killer-in-history-who-fed-women-to-pigs-reignites-rage-by-publishing-book/">published a memoir</a>. The story gets worse the more you read about it, particularly the fact that proceeds from the sales of the book benefit the serial killer&rsquo;s cellmate, a convicted child molester.</p></li>

<li><p>So we don&rsquo;t end on the worst news of the week, the <a href="http://www.sfwa.org/2016/02/2015-nebula-awards-nominees-announced/">Nebula Award nominees have been announced</a>! We&rsquo;re most excited for the wonderful <em>Nimona</em>,  a young adult comic by Noelle Stevenson, and <em>Ancillary Mercy</em>, the third book in the series by Ann Leckie that started with <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/pronouns-in-space/"><em>Ancillary Justice</em></a>.</p></li>
