<p>&ldquo;I started writing poetry in eighth grade,&rdquo; our February Poet in Residence, Azura Tyabji, tells me over the phone. She&rsquo;d always considered herself a writer - she wrote and assembled her own books as a child, and she participated in the school paper as soon as she could - but &ldquo;I never really considered myself a poet.&rdquo; It was an assignment to read a poem in a student showcase that inspired her. She credits her language arts teachers for &ldquo;validating that yes, what I was writing <em>was</em>, in fact, poetry, and that it deserved an audience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyabji continued to write poetry, but a couple years after her first reading, she became involved with the <a href="http://youthspeaks.org/">local writing organization Youth Speaks</a>, and then everything became clear. At first, she attended a poetry slam and she found the competitive atmosphere to be too intimidating to participate, &ldquo;but then I went to an open mic and it was one of the most welcoming, beautiful, nurturing communities that I&rsquo;d ever witnessed. And I decided I want to join this beautiful community and give back to it and be a part of it.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s been a part of Youth Speaks ever since.</p>

<p>Ask Tyabji what poets she&rsquo;s reading right now and she enthusiastically supplies a list of names. &ldquo;Locally, <a href="http://writebloody.com/shop/products/my-my-my-my-my/">Tara Hardy</a> is someone that I&rsquo;ve been reading again and again and again, and I just want to see <a href="https://www.poetrynw.org/anastacia-renee-two-poems/">Anastacia-Renee</a> speak at the Seattle Public Library.&rdquo; The two poets inspire Tyabji as performers, as writers, and as people. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just in awe of how they craft their imagery and I think that they both really have this whimsical style that I hope to learn from,&rdquo; she says. And she reads the work of Washington State Poet Laureate <a href="http://www.castroluna.com/">Claudia Castro Luna</a> &ldquo;whenever I want to be inspired to observe my city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nationally, Tyabji is a big fan of spoken word artist Olivia Gatwood, whose 2017 collection <em>New American Best Friend</em> is a big influence on her work. &ldquo;She writes very intimately about girlhood - she writes about period panties, and she has a poem called &lsquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yGzMUzrgzA">Ode to my Bitch Face</a>.&rsquo; She&rsquo;s so bold in how she describes and prioritizes girls.&rdquo; From Gatwood, Tyabji is learning how to &ldquo;uplift women and girls to fight against shame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyabji is a writer on the verge of a big shift. She&rsquo;s graduating high school this June, and she&rsquo;s staying in Seattle for her gap year before heading to a college that is &ldquo;probably out of state.&rdquo; Is she concerned about leaving her community behind? &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be really sad to let Youth Speaks Seattle go when it is my time to leave,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But I know that the community here will keep growing and keep preserving itself and also find new paths, and I can always come back and visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She has no doubt that she&rsquo;ll be able to find a community of poets no matter where she goes. &ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve learned for myself is that I can&rsquo;t write poetry alone. I&rsquo;m always absorbing what other people have taught me, and I think that&rsquo;s how we all work as poets: absorbing and is being influenced by each other,&rdquo; Tyabji says.</p>

<p>But no matter where she ends up, Tyabji knows where her roots are. &ldquo;I consider myself a Seattle poet,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Not just because I was born here and grew up here, but because I try to write about my city, especially with how it&rsquo;s changing, how it&rsquo;s being transformed into a city that&rsquo;s not necessarily friendly to the same people that have lived here for a long time,&rdquo; both through gentrification and institutional racism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m trying to challenge myself to write about what I love about the city. Yesterday I just watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7piev1A77gQ">a poem by Laura &lsquo;Piece&rsquo; Kelly called &lsquo;Central District.&rsquo;</a>,&rdquo; Tyabji says. &ldquo;She writes so lovingly about her community in the Central District and about growing up in Seattle, and that&rsquo;s something I want to challenge myself to remember as well: although the city has so many things that it needs to work on, there is beauty in it as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyabji sets a lot of goals for herself. She wants to do writing residencies, and publish a chapbook, and learn how to teach poetry. She&rsquo;s currently starting to co-teach a class on slam poetry at her high school, and she says &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to see what I&rsquo;ll discover about my own work when I teach others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Tyabji reads her own work, she radiates an air of confidence that many poets twice her age will never be able to muster. What&rsquo;s her secret? &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m preparing to share a poem for the first time, I really sit down with what I have written and I read it over - in my head first and then out loud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As her own first audience, she says, &ldquo;I read the poem until I really am confident that this piece brings me joy.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s important &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re sharing your work with other people to go somewhere where you&rsquo;re surrounded by people that love you unconditionally. Find your community - even if it&rsquo;s small. I&rsquo;m really blessed to have the Youth Speaks community, and we really give love to every poet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyabji likes to remember that all poets have anxiety about their work. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re never going to get to a point where we&rsquo;re not anxious, where we&rsquo;re a hundred percent confident about anything. I could choose to despair over that fact, or I can use it as a motivator,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s great that I will never be perfect,&rdquo; Tyabji says. &ldquo;I think I can learn so much from that. I can always keep challenging myself.&rdquo;</p>
