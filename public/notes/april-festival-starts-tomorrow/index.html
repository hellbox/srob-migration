<p>This week&rsquo;s sponsor, <a href="http://www.aprilfestival.com" title="aprilfestival.com | A festival of independent literature">the APRIL Festival</a>, kicks off with a bang Tuesday night at the Pine Box, with performances by Alejandro de Acosta, Sara Jaffe, Jenny Zhang and Kelly Froh. Doors open at 7:30pm.</p>

<p>Then, every night this week, and into the weekend, the festival goes strong. We have a <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">full event listing on our sponsor&rsquo;s page</a> for you to plan your festival week. We hope, at the very least, to see you on Sunday at the APRIL Book Expo at Hugo House, where the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> will have a table.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">take a look at our open dates</a>. We&rsquo;d love to talk to you about opportunities to sponsor us.</p>
