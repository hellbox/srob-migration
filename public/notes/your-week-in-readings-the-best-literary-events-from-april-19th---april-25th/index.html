<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday April 19th: *The Book of Joan* Reading**</h5></p> 
Portland novelist Lidia Yuknavitch is a Northwest superstar. Her prickly, gorgeous fiction is at recognizable and more than a little bit scary. (It’s scary in part because it is so recognizable.) Yuknavitch’s latest, *The Book of Joan*, is a sci-fi novel that retells the story of Joan of Arc in a blasted-out dystopic wasteland.

<p>Phinney Books’s Dock Street Salon series is always a fun time. Authors talk in a fairly up close and intimate setting with an engaged and excited audience. Today’s readers are Anne Liu Kellor, Jennifer D. Munro, and Ann Teplick. Expect a reading, a lively Q&amp;A, and maybe some booze (not in that order.)

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Friday April 21st: <em>The Histories</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
A few local writers have told me that Seattle poet Jason Whitmarsh’s second book, <em>The Histories</em>, is their favorite poetry collection this year. It’s a book of absurdist, deeply funny prose poems that constructs an alternate history for the world, with singing Kafkas and MacGyver references galore.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Sunday April 23rd: <em>Caucasians Anonymous</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
You might know Marcus Harrison Green best for his excellent news site, the South Seattle Emerald. But tonight, he’s showing off a new side: he’s debuting a reading of his work-in progress play titled <em>Caucasians Anonymous</em>, which investigates “the social construction known as Whiteness.” This event also features a Q&amp;A on race and privilege.
