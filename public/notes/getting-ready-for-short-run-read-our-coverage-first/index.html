<p>Tomorrow is one of the best days in the literary Seattle calendar year: <a href="http://shortrun.org/">Short Run happens at Seattle Center</a>, both in the Fisher Pavillion (where exhibitors will be showing thousands of independantly produced books and comics and art) and at the Vera Project (where programming including panels and interviews will play out all day.) It runs from 11 to 6, and it&rsquo;s absolutely free!</p>

<p>But before you go, you might want to learn about some of the authors you&rsquo;ll be able to meet at the show. Here&rsquo;s all of this week&rsquo;s Short Run coverage in one handy place:</p>
