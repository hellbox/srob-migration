<p class="noindent">Conon Parks returns as sponsor this week to share an excerpt from _Some Kind of Ending_, a collaboration with Mike MacNeil and illustrator Randy Jones. Set in Reagan-era Seattle, _Ending_ is a solid whole built from materials that always feel like they're about to drop you through the slats — sentences that steer you one way, then spin you like a bottle; sketches and scribbles that feel like they came straight from a zine. It's gritty, it's weird, and it'll turn you upside down and shake the change out of your pockets — all the while reassuring you that you're its best friend.</p>
