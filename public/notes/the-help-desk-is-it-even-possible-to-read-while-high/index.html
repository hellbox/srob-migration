<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

<p><strong>I love to read. I love to smoke pot. I can&rsquo;t smoke pot and read. I can get high and watch movies, but words on a page get all swimmy when I&rsquo;ve had even just a single puff. But I have friends who love to smoke and read, and they make me so jealous when they talk about sitting down for a night with a book and a joint and reading two or three hundred pages at a go. Can I make my dream a reality, or is my own brain chemistry working against me?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Jean,</p>

<p>I find your friends&rsquo; claims of reading (let alone retaining) hundreds of pages of text while high incredibly suspect, perhaps because I have trouble with basic tasks while high, like peeling fruit, blinking, and telephones. What in the Oxford-loving fuck are your friends reading and how could it possibly be more fun than rubbing your belly and chanting the word &ldquo;velocity&rdquo; under your breath in a dark closet?</p>

<p>To your question: Instead of reading books, give graphic novels a try. Ignore what little text there is and focus on the beautiful illustrations. I&rsquo;d start with <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780375714726"><em>Black Hole</em></a> and <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781560979159"><em>Bottomless Belly Button</em></a> – both of which, if memory serves, are pretty light on text. Another option is to pick up <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781606993408"><em>Weathercraft</em></a> or <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781606994375"><em>Congress of the Animals</em></a> by local genius Jim Woodring. Most of his books are wordless, beautiful and weird.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
