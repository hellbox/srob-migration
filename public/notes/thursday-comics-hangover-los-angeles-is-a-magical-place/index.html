<p class="intro">(*Every comics fan knows that Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country.* Thursday Comics Hangover *is a weekly column reviewing some of the new books that I pick up at [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/), my friendly neighborhood comic book store.*)</p>

<p class="noindent">I swear every month brings a new comic series about a paranormal investigator. It's one of the most overplayed ideas out there — a down-on-his-luck detective who bumps into demons or vampires or some other creature-of-the-week riff. The last iteration of the trope that I bought into was Paul Jenkins and Humberto Ramos's terrible series *Revelations*, which read like toothless *John Constantine: Hellblazer* comics. The paranormal investigator is the laziest way to present supernatural fiction, by giving us a jaded main character who explains everything to the reader. Why mess with this stuff if you're not going to try to instill a sense of wonder or horror or surprise in the reader?</p>

<p><p class="image"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1437633313784/Wolf01.jpg" alt="" /></p>The newest paranormal detective series to hit the stands is <em>Wolf</em>, written by Ales Kot and illustrated by Matt Taylor, and I&rsquo;ll be damned if it doesn&rsquo;t somehow crack the code for a successful supernatural PI. Maybe it&rsquo;s because this is an oversized first issue that has plenty of room to breathe, but Kot and Taylor have somehow made a paranormal detective story that actually feels like a detective story. This could be a Raymond Chandler novel, if Raymond Chandler wrote about real vampires instead of the emotional variety.</p>

<p>The first time we meet our hero, Antoine Wolfe, he&rsquo;s on fire. But he&rsquo;s not really in any hurry to put himself out. Instead, he wanders around the back roads of Los Angeles, singing a Robert Johnson song to himself. We learn that Wolfe may (or may not) be immortal. At least, he seems to think he is. Wolfe&rsquo;s Los Angeles is packed with vampires and corrupt businessmen looking to hush up a murder or two. Around every corner is a goon waiting to knock him out and throw him in the trunk of a car. And Wolfe, who is African-American, understands that while the supernatural is dangerous, he&rsquo;s just as likely to get killed by a racist asshole with an axe to grind. The world is a dangerous place for him on multiple levels.</p>

<p>Taylor&rsquo;s art helps to sell the story&rsquo;s sunbaked Lovecraftian noir by staying simple and realistic. The cars look like cars, the people behave like people — Wolfe punches like a man who took a boxing class, in direct defiance of most ridiculous comics combat styles — and colorist Lee Loughridge keeps everything soaked in nauseating tones of green, so even the most ordinary panels seem to leak out a menace that&rsquo;s swirling just beneath the ink and paper.</p>

<p>Kot seems to know what he&rsquo;s doing here as he lays out the rules of <em>Wolf</em>&rsquo;s magic. We see a surprising array of supernatural aspects in the course of one single issue, but all the different menaces seem to behave similarly; magic is something that visits you and never leaves. It haunts people, including Wolfe, plucking at their sanity like a novice playing with a harp. It&rsquo;s hard to tell who&rsquo;s an eccentric urban mage and who&rsquo;s another schizophrenic, dumped on the street by a system that stopped caring decades ago. In other words, it looks a lot like real life.</p>
