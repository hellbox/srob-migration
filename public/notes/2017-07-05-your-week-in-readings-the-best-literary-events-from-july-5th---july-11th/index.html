You probably know who the Koch Brothers are — those ridiculously wealthy tax-hating men who bankroll everything evil in the conservative agenda. But did you know that the Koch Brothers, as children, had a nanny who made them defecate on demand? Discuss that, and how they implemented their horrific agenda, in this month’s book club.
