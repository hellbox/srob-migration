<p>In <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/12/17/too-hard-take/">the December issue of the <em>New York Review of Books</em></a>, Doubleday executive editor Gerald Howard takes on reviewer Daniel Mendelsohn for <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/12/03/striptease-among-pals/">his review of the Doubleday novel <em>A Little Life</em></a>. Howard&rsquo;s letter concludes: &ldquo;At bottom Mendelsohn seems to have decided that <em>A Little Life</em> just <strong>appeals to the wrong kind of reader</strong>. That’s an invidious distinction unworthy of a critic of his usually fine discernment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is not the only charge levied against this particular reviewer and this particular review. As <a href="http://blogs.bookforum.com/paper/2015/12/01/critic-vs-editor/"><em>Bookforum</em> noted</a>, Mendelsohn was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/24/good-books-women-readers-literary-critics-sexism">recently accused by the author Jennifer Wiener</a> of &ldquo;Goldfinching,&rdquo; or diminishing popular books written by and for women.</p>

<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1449042654265/alittlelife.jpeg" alt="" /></p>I have yet to read <em>A Little Life</em> — I know! I know! But sometimes life gets in the way — so I can&rsquo;t comment extensively on the matter. But I&rsquo;m disappointed by Mendelsohn&rsquo;s response to Howard, which concludes with an admission that the word &ldquo;duped&rdquo; in his review of <em>A Little Life</em> might have been a poor choice, but that &ldquo;One only wishes that [Howard] had imposed as stringent an editorial oversight on his author as he would do on her reviewers.&rdquo; It feels way too flip and combative a response to a serious charge.</p>

<p>Ideally, a reviewer should always be able to parse a book from its fans. But sometimes that&rsquo;s impossible; sometimes a book&rsquo;s success becomes part of the story of the book, as inextricable as its plot and main characters. And sometimes a reviewer has to address an author&rsquo;s persona in the course of a review. (<a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/picking-wires-from-a-bowl-of-noodles/">Here&rsquo;s a great example of that</a>.) But when a review takes on the supposed audience of the book as part of a broader argument against the supposed self-victimization of college students, as Mendelsohn&rsquo;s review does, that&rsquo;s perhaps a step too far. It&rsquo;s one thing to extrapolate from a book&rsquo;s themes into a larger conversation about society. It&rsquo;s another thing to imagine an audience for the book and then use that imagined audience as an example of what&rsquo;s wrong with society.</p>

<p>I also find it distasteful that Mendelsohn&rsquo;s review overtly refers to the gendered perspective of <em>A Little Life</em> as &ldquo;bear[ing] a superficial resemblance to a certain kind of &lsquo;woman’s novel&rsquo; of an earlier age&rdquo; and then immediately accuses the book of having the structure &ldquo;of a striptease.&rdquo; The sexist condescension there — the diminishment of the book, first as a new version of a &ldquo;woman&rsquo;s novel,&rdquo; and then as a stripper — feels very purposeful to me.</p>

<p>As Howard notes at the beginning of his letter to the editor, authors should almost always leave negative reviews alone. Rarely will you encounter a good reason to argue with a critic over a negative review; you&rsquo;re not going to change the critic&rsquo;s mind, and the argument is going to make the author look petty and small. But in this case, I&rsquo;m glad that Howard stepped forward. Mendelsohn crossed a couple of very important lines in his review, and Howard was right to carry this conversation over into the public sphere.</p>
