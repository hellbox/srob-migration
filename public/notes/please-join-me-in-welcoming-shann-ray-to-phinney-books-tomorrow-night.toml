After you've celebrated [Independent Bookstore Day](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/27/event-of-the-week-independent-bookstore-day-on-saturday-april-30/) tomorrow, I hope you'll [come out to Phinney Books](http://www.phinneybooks.com/upcoming-events/2016/4/30/shann-ray-in-conversation-with-paul-constant) for a special edition of the Dock Street Salon. Spokane author [Shann Ray](http://shannray.com/about/), who wrote the novel *American Copper*, will read and then he and I will be in conversation. *Copper* is a novel about Montana in the early 20th century, and Ray has very interesting things to say about masculinity. He also, according to his bio, "teaches leadership and forgiveness studies at Gonzaga University," which is absolutely fascinating. So if you're up for a conversation about forgiveness, masculinity, basketball, and maybe bookstores, I hope you'll show up at Phinney Books around seven. It's free, and usually Dock Street brings along something to drink, too.
