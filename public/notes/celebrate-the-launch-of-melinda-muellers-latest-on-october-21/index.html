<p class="noindent">Make sure to save Saturday night, October 21, for the launch party for <em>Mary&#8217;s Dust</em>, a much-anticipated book by Seattle poet Melinda Mueller. Hosted by sponsor Entre Ríos Books, the event includes a reading by Mueller (and she&#8217;s a great reader, crisp, clear, and compelling) and live music by cellist Lori Goldston. You&#8217;ll also get a first peek at a new short film, in which local lights Laura Da', Christine Deavel, and Kathleen Flenniken join Mueller for a &#8220;making of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mueller is a scientist, as well as a poet, and she brings the scientist&#8217;s gimlet eye to every line, digging into history for her subjects and transforming what she finds. <em>Mary&#8217;s Dust</em> re-tells the stories of 32 historical Marys — writers, actresses, physicists; risk-takers and rule-breakers. Entre Ríos has shared one of those Marys with our readers this week. Take a look at <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">our sponsor page</a> for an excerpt from the book, a sample of Mueller reading, and an early look at the new film.</p>
