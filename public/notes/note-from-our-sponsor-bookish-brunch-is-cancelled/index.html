<p>We just heard from <a href="http://www.seattle7writers.org">Seattle7Writers</a>, and they&rsquo;re sorry to report the Bookish Brunch had to be cancelled.</p>

<blockquote class="noline">Due to unforeseen circumstances, the Bookish Brunch is cancelled. Thank you for your support of Seattle7Writers; we look forward to seeing you at another event soon!</blockquote>

<p>Big thanks to Seattle7Writers for their sponsorship this week. Be sure to keep in touch with them, maybe <a href="http://www.seattle7writers.org/contact.html">pop your name onto their mailing list</a>, so you know when the next event is coming up.</p>
