<p>From <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/11/richard-brittain-assault.html">Jessica Roy at The Cut</a>, a horrific lede:</p>

<blockquote>A British man used social media to stalk a teen in Scotland, then traveled 500 miles to the grocery store where she worked and smashed her over the head with a wine bottle, all because she gave his self-published book a bad review.</blockquote>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s time to briefly go over the rules of engagement for authors?</p>

<ol>
<li>Be gracious and brief when you receive praise on social media.</li>
<li>Engage with your fans. Be nice and kind and good.</li>
<li>Never respond to critics who write bad reviews; you&rsquo;re not going to convince a critic that they actually liked your book, and bystanders will think you&rsquo;re petty.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t stalk your critics and hit them with wine bottles. In fact, don&rsquo;t hit them at all. Or stalk them. Don&rsquo;t stalk anybody. Don&rsquo;t hit anybody. Don&rsquo;t be a bad person. Be a good person.</li>
<li>Rule 4 is the most important one.</li>
</ol>
