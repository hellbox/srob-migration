<p><strong>MONDAY</strong> Let’s start our week off with one of the last Works in Progress open mic nights at the <a href="https://hugohouse.org/event/works-in-progress-2/2016-02-01/">Hugo House</a> in its current location. Works in Progress has been going on for years now, and it will undoubtedly stick with Hugo House in their <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/05/the-frye-art-museum-gives-hugo-house-a-temporary-home/">temporary location on First Hill</a>, but there is a certain kind of magic to the Hugo House cabaret space right now, as awkward as it can be when there’s a full house. There have been a lot of readers on this stage, and this is one of your last chances to get up there and give it a shot. Why not?</p>

<p><strong>TUESDAY</strong> It’s time for <a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2483221">Salon of Shame</a> at the Cornish Playhouse in Seattle Center. The Salon, in case you didn’t know, is an ongoing reading series where people read their awkward teenage writing aloud. It’s cringe-y and funny and kind of empowering, in that it reminds you that you have evolved beyond your teenage self, even if you essentially feel the same inside.</p>

<p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong> This is the big event of the week: <strong>Eli Sanders and Jennifer Hopper</strong> appear in conversation with with Marcie Sillman at <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/eli-sanders-jennifer-hopper-marcie-sillman-town-hall-seattle">Town Hall</a>. Sanders’s long-awaited book about the South Park home invasion case, <em>While the City Slept</em>, is finally published on Tuesday of this week, and this is an event to commemorate the book’s release. We’ll have more to say about this book in the next few days, but you should absolutely read it. It’s beautiful and sad and a brilliant piece of journalism.</p>

<p>Across town, I’ll be at the taping of <em>Civic Cocktail</em>, which is a local-interest TV show hosted by Joni Balter. Steve Scher and I will be interviewing local treasure <strong>Nancy Pearl</strong>. Four of Seattle’s city councilmembers will be there, too, to discuss the new woman-majority council. You can <a href="https://www.seattlecityclub.org/civic-cocktail">register for that here</a>.</p>

<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1454278645795/Bernie0.jpg" alt="" /></p> <strong>THURSDAY</strong> Head back to <a href="http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=02&amp;evyear=2016&amp;eventid=2016011213275600&amp;pre=20160201&amp;pst=20160209">Town Hall</a> tonight for <strong>Ted Rall</strong>, who is reading from his cartoon biography of Bernie Sanders. I interviewed Rall last year when he came to town with his biography of Edward Snowden, and he’s a passionate, knowledgeable interviewee. If you have questions about Senator Sanders, this might be the place to get ‘em answered.</p>

<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong> <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/anastacia-tolbert-friends">Elliott Bay Book Company</a> hosts <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/25/rattail/"><strong>Anastacia Tolbert</strong></a>, who will be reading with <strong>Storme Webber</strong> and a touring program of Cave Canem fellows including <strong>Kamilah Aishah Moon and Librecht Baker</strong>. Cave Canem, if you didn’t know, is an organization that promotes and cultivates the work and careers of African-American poets. Every time they come to town, they blow audiences away.</p>

<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1062476830463732/">Write Here Write Now</a> happens at Fremont Abbey today. This one is for the authors: press materials promise a “one-day writing intensive like any other,” with an array of “mini-lessons, 1-on-1 author consultations, and lots of writing time with fellow writers.” This year’s keynote will be delivered by novelist <strong>Nancy Horan</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong>  Seattle historian <strong>Paul Dorpat</strong> will discuss the life and legacy of Seattle restaurateur and personality Ivar Haglund at the <a href="http://www.spl.org/calendar-of-events#/?i=3">West Seattle branch of Seattle Public Library</a>. Dorpat has some rare photographs of Haglund and will talk about the clam guy’s West Seattle roots.</p>
