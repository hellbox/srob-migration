<p>Its wings don’t ground into dust, nor do they signal<br>
another ending. That is up to us, our rippled fingertips</p>

<p>smoothing the brown contours that flutter away<br>
from our wish. The wings’ scales are tiny windows,</p>

<p>cathedrals of solar dust sealed into letters<br>
that contain all of our questions: why are we here?</p>

<p>where do we go when we die? are we really so alone?<br>
The moth collides endlessly with the moon, we see</p>

<p>its celestial weaving with immeasurable fragility,<br>
and we feel night exposed for the first time again:</p>

<p>chafing pine needles erasing all we thought we knew <br>
of this life, the owl screeching the universe’s original</p>

<p>vowel. When the earth is no longer ours the letters<br>
will slide open easily as a palm cupping water</p>

<p>or a moth revolving around a porch light pouring<br>
fine dust into a thirsty mouth that calls everything loss.</p>
