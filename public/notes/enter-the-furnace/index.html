<p>Seattle poet (and <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/25/rattail/"><em>Seattle Review of Books</em> contributor</a>) Anastacia Renee Tolbert read as part of the <a href="https://thefurnaceseattle.wordpress.com/">Furnace Reading Series</a> at Hollow Earth Radio earlier this month. She told a story featuring the city of Seattle as a protagonist. Now <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hollowearthradio/the-furnace-featuring-anastacia-renee-tolbert">that reading is available online for free</a>. If you&rsquo;ve only ever experienced Tolbert&rsquo;s writing in print form, you&rsquo;re in for a real treat; her spoken word performances are absolutely riveting, and she can turn a room into a party, or a funeral, or church, just with just a few well-placed syllables. Take a listen, and plan to attend the next Furnace live. They do a good job of recording all their readings, but recordings can never quite capture that thrill of live performance.</p>
