<p>I&rsquo;ve already <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/it-was-always-this-way-until-it-wasnt/">written at length</a> about Amy Goldstein&rsquo;s amazing book <em>Janesville</em>. It was one of my favorite books of last year, a beautifully reported study of the economic turmoil that rocks Paul Ryan&rsquo;s hometown after the GM plant closes. If you want to understand the human cost of the perils facing rural America right now, there&rsquo;s no better book to read — toss aside your <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> and your <em>New York Times</em> profiles of sympathetic Trump supporters, because you won&rsquo;t need them anymore.</p>

<p>Happily, everybody at the Reading Through It Book Club last night seemed to enjoy and appreciate <em>Janesville</em>. Most were moved by the human drama, and almost all of us learned something new about the desolation caused when a company leaves a company town. Goldstein puts the lie to the idea that retraining can fix everything when massive layoffs hit, and she explains why people can&rsquo;t just pull up roots and move to the city in the face of hardships.</p>

<p>Reading <em>Janesville</em>, the problems that gave rise to Donald Trump became very clear. Less clear, though, were the answers to the problems. We got into a heated discussion about universal basic income, and whether that could resolve the problem of an undereducated population that&rsquo;s been forcefully stripped of their usefulness. Nobody could come up with a satisfying suggestion for how to diversify a rural economy so that a single GM plant&rsquo;s departure can&rsquo;t destroy thousands of lives with a single announcement.</p>

<p>Democratic leaders have let rural Americans down with their inaction. And rural Americans responded by tilting the electoral college in Donald Trump&rsquo;s favor, because Trump was the only candidate who was talking clearly about the problems plaguing rural America. Until Democrats can figure out how to fix these problems — how to strengthen rural economies and provide a sense of purpose for people who have been left behind in the 21st century — the future of this country is in peril.</p>

<p>The Reading Through It Book Club meets next on Wednesday, April 4th at 7 pm. The event is free to attend, and our next selection, <em>Kill All Normies: Online Culture Wars from 4Chan and Tumblr to Trump and the Alt-Right</em> by Angela Nagle, is now 20% off at Third Place Books Seward Park.</p>
