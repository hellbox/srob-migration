<p>The Seattle Antiquarian Bookfair is our sponsor again this week, and we&rsquo;re starting to get excited about the fair. It&rsquo;s this Saturday and Sunday, October 10th &amp; 11th. Tickets are a huge bargain &mdash; only $5 for both days! &mdash; and you&rsquo;ll get to take in the best of what Seattle Center has to offer before or after you visit. <a href="/sponsorships">Check out the video on our sponsor page</a> to get a feel for what you&rsquo;ll see there, and be sure to tell them you heard about it on the Seattle Review of Books (and, keep your eyes peeled for us there. We&rsquo;ll be checking it out).</p>

<p>Our partners are what let us bring you all the content you&rsquo;ve see. If you check us to find out what we&rsquo;ve published every day, take a look and see what our sponsors have to offer. You may be pleasantly surprised. It&rsquo;s all part of our campaign to make <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">online advertising something that benefits readers and publishers</a> both.</p>
