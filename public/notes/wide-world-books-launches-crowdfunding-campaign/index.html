<p>On the same weekend that Seattle Mystery Bookshop&rsquo;s GoFundMe campaign <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/seattlemystery">draws to a close</a>, Wallingford&rsquo;s delightful Wide World Travel &amp; Maps — the oldest travel bookstore in the country — has <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/wideworldbooks">launched their own GoFundMe campaign</a>. They&rsquo;re looking to raise $30,000, and <a href="http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2698#m31577">according to Shelf Awareness</a>, Rick Steves&rsquo; Europe has donated a compelling travel package if the store hits its goals.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/15/seattle-mystery-bookshop-launches-gofundme-campaign/">I said when Seattle Mystery Bookshop announced their campaign</a>, if crowd-funding isn’t your thing but you like to support independent bookstores, stop by Wide World Travel &amp; Maps — they’re at 4411 Wallingford Ave N — and pick up a few books to prepare for an upcoming vacation, or a trip that you hope to one day make. What is a travel bookstore, after all, but a promise you make to yourself?</p>
