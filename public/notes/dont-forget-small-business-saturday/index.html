<p>Tomorrow, of course, is Thanksgiving. The day after that is Black Friday. Don&rsquo;t shop anywhere on Black Friday; it&rsquo;s a mess out there. But on Saturday, you should go shop at your favorite small business, because it&rsquo;s Small Business Saturday. Small businesses are essential to local economies; <a href="https://www.amiba.net/resources/multiplier-effect/">studies have shown</a> that while only 14 cents of every dollar spent at a chain recirculate through the local economy, nearly 50 cents of every dollar spent at a small business stays in the local economy.</p>

<p>Your favorite small businesses are probably bookstores. And a lot of local bookstores are celebrating Small Business Saturday with special events and deals. Here are some of the treasures you&rsquo;ll find:</p>
