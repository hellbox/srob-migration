<p>I go out to smoke but first<br>
To get my lighter from the Jeep &amp;<br>
Walking past I see a lady<br>
Leaning against a silver car in front of the bldg<br>
She’s on the phone<br>
She’s talking<br>
&amp; leaning is that her car<br>
A crow is very upset<br>
Calling &amp; cawing &amp; gargling it seems<br>
A branch in the tree the lady<br>
Does not notice me I see<br>
Her pink hood &amp; black hair her<br>
Yellow bag leaning against<br>
The silver car OK<br>
That sounds very good to me<br>
She says &amp; leans fwd toward<br>
The thread between her<br>
&amp; another lady it must be<br>
On the other end a thread<br>
Stretched like the two plus<br>
Hundred years of silence<br>
Btwn Emily &amp; the shepherd<br>
Begging live with me come be<br>
My love the silence<br>
Is the most important element of<br>
Any poem according to Allen<br>
Grossman she’s discussing the<br>
Details of meeting somewhere else if<br>
<em>I’m not there then</em></p>

<p><em>No I cannot</em></p>
