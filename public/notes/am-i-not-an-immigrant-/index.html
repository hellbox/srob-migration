<p class="prose-poem"><em>(After Soujourner Truth’s speech, Ain’t I a woman?)</em><br><br>There is so much turmoil in our country of late, something must be terribly wrong.<br><br>There is a man over there, who occupies the highest office in the land, who says immigrants are rapists, criminals, the worst kind of people.<br><br>I have never committed a crime, have paid taxes every year of my adult life, and have worked to earn an honest wage! And, am I not an immigrant?<br><br>He says, immigrants take away from everyone and for this they should be rounded up by the millions and deported; they should be banned and blacklisted for worshiping in a way that differs from his. I studied hard to obtain an education and worked to educate children in public schools and everyday commit to lead a life worthy of my parent’s sacrifice, who knew this country was by no means perfect, but it offered us refuge and hope! And, am I not an immigrant?<br><br>That man over there may well say, “you are an exception,” but let me tell you, all of us in my immigrant family, my immigrant friends, and many immigrant brothers and sisters, none of us lead our lives to cheat, deceit, take advantage of anyone or any system. We love our kin like everyone else and aspire to a fulfilled life. <br><br>The immigrants I know are nurses, teachers, doctors, day laborers, professors. They own businesses, clean school buildings, compose music, make sculptures, write poems. And all are dreamers.<br><br>From its dawning where did the majority of this country’s population come from? Where did it come from?<br><br>From other places, other countries! The exceptionalism of this country resides in that very fact!  In the respect and wonderment of difference.<br><br>Let her, let her who can produce a birth certificate immune to the waves of immigration to this county, speak to the grandeur of this land before it was bound to western laws.<br><br>Otherwise the road has been/is made by walking &mdash; together. Juntos. Together. Todos Juntos. All together.
