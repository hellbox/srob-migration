<p>How excited are we to have Hugo House as a sponsor? More than you can know. Unless you&rsquo;ve taken a Hugo House class, or been to a reading there, or met with one of their writers in residence, or gone to a one-day workshop, or&hellip;.well, if you know Hugo House, you know why they&rsquo;re excited.</p>

<p>They want you to know they&rsquo;re in their new digs on First Hill, next to the Frye Art Museum. They have a ton of great events coming up, but pay attention! The awesome Write-O-Rama on June 25 os a great way to get a feel for the classes Hugo House offers without a big commitment. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">Read more about it on our Sponsor&rsquo;s page</a>, and <a href="http://www.strangertickets.com/events/34001672/write-o-rama">pick up tickets</a> as soon as you can.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s thanks to sponsors like Hugo House, and readers like you, we sold out this season of our sponsorships. We couldn&rsquo;t be more thrilled.
