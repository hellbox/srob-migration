Individual tickets for Seattle Arts and Lectures' 2015 and 2016 reading series are now available on their website. This is the best SAL season in years, featuring authors like Ta-Nehisi Coates, Emily St. John Mandel, Teju Cole, and Claudia Rankine. If you can't afford a full series pass, now is the time to [stock up on tickets](http://www.lectures.org/season/) for the lectures you simply can't miss. The Coates and Cole readings, in particular, will likely sell out soon.
