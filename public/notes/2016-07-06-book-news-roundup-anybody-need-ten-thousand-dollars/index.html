<li><p>The Short Run Festival <a href="http://shortrun.org/welcome-special-guest-hatem-imam/">announced their latest special guest</a>: Hatem Imam, a cartoonist and editor who was put on trial in Lebanon for the &ldquo;crime&rdquo; of publishing two supposedly controversial panels in anthology comics. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-fate-of-a-joke-in-lebanon">This <em>New Yorker</em> story has more information</a> about the trial. Imam&rsquo;s appearance in Seattle this fall will undoubtedly kick off a citywide conversation about religion, censorship, and satire. Short Run is on November 5th this year.</p></li>

<li><p>Starting on July 11th, Seattle-area fiction writers will <a href="http://artisttrust.org/index.php/for-artists/money#gar_lasalle_storyteller_award">be able to apply</a> for the second annual Gar La Salle Storyteller award, &ldquo;an unrestricted award of $10,000 given to a Washington State artist who is engaged in storytelling through their work in various artistic disciplines.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s some big money. The first winner of the Award was <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/08/anca-szil%C3%A1gyi-wins-the-first-gar-lasalle-storyteller-award/">local writer Anca Szilágyi</a>.</p></li>

</ul>

<blockquote>Yeah, and apparently gin turns some people into monsters. So, the idea is that not everyone is going to like weed; and don’t think there’s anything wrong with you if you don’t like weed. Because it’s all about your system and what kind of feelings you enjoy.</blockquote>
