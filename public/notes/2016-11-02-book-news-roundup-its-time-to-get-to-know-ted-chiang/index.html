<li>Seattle-area writer Ted Chiang has long been one of the local sci-fi community&rsquo;s best-kept secrets. Just about every Seattle sci-fi writer worth their salt counts Chiang as one of their favorite writers, but his work has not garnered larger acclaim. That&rsquo;s all about to change: one of Chiang&rsquo;s short stories is about to be adapted into an upcoming film called <em>Arrival</em> starring Amy Adams that is attracting a lot of pre-release buzz.<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-story-in-sci-fi-writer-ted-chiangs-life-hollywood-1478015805">The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> published</a> a great little profile of Chiang yesterday that you should read.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>“He’s got a really good mix of humanity and science, unlike some writers,” said Ellen Datlow, the editor who acquired “Tower of Babylon,” the first story of Mr. Chiang’s to be published, for *Omni* magazine in 1990.</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>While we&rsquo;re talking about Seattle-area writers, <a href="https://electricliterature.com/native-voices-wont-be-silenced-aede8c2adc6b#.niuao1g71"><em>Electric Lit</em> published a long interview</a> with Elissa Washuta that you should read.</p></li>

<li><p>So this is kind of creepy: <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2016/amazon-gives-prime-members-better-prices-physical-bookstores-hinting-new-retail-strategy/">according to GeekWire</a>, at Amazon&rsquo;s brick-and-mortar bookstore, you&rsquo;re apparently only able to buy books on discount if you&rsquo;re an Amazon Prime customer. If you&rsquo;re not on Prime, you pay full list price.</p></li>

<li><p>Greta Van Susteren has a bad opinion about the cost of colleges. Rather than cutting the ridiculously expensive stadiums or coaches&rsquo; salaries, she seems to think libraries are making colleges too damn expensive:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Colleges should stop building vanity projects like huge libraries and billing students-full libraries are on our smartphones! <a href="https://t.co/QBeVKZvIKZ">https://t.co/QBeVKZvIKZ</a></p>&mdash; Greta Van Susteren (@greta) <a href="https://twitter.com/greta/status/793052011386265600">October 31, 2016</a></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>On that last item, let&rsquo;s be clear: books are an investment in education, and they are non-negotiable. In fact, eliminating library books from a college would disproportionately harm low-income students who might not have the technology needed for ebooks. This is clearly an idea that was not at all thought through.</li>
</ul>
