<p>Phinney Books is one of Seattle&rsquo;s favorite bookstores. It&rsquo;s smartly and creatively curated, it&rsquo;s a delight to be in, and it&rsquo;s an active reading and gathering space — their door is always open to Seattle&rsquo;s literary community. They&rsquo;re sponsoring the site this week to let you know about a  program that brings the spirit of the shop right to your doorstep: <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/">Phinney by Post</a>, a monthly (or every-other-month) subscription service.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but we get pretty excited at the prospect of having Phinney Books&rsquo; expert staff hand-choose a year of reading for us. Take a look at <a href="http://www.phinneybooks.com/phinney-by-post-selections/">the selections for the last couple of years</a> and you&rsquo;ll see what we mean. Sign up for any version of the Phinney by Post subscription program — there are plans for every budget and taste, including an option for children’s picture books — and they&rsquo;ll make your snail mail special again.</p>

<p>Sponsors like Phinney Books make the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> possible. It&rsquo;s how we pay our writers and promote great programs like Phinney by Post, and it&rsquo;s part of our commitment to <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">make internet advertising 100% less terrible</a>. We&rsquo;d love to feature your book, event, or opportunity on the site. <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">Reserve a date now</a>.</p>
