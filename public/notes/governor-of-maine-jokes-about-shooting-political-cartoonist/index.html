<p>The governor of my native state of Maine, Paul LePage, is unequivocally an imbecile. He&rsquo;s combative and unempathetic and ignorant and proud of it. He says terrible things on a very regular basis. But his most recent gaffe, <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2015/06/25/lepage-jokes-about-shooting-maine-political-cartoonist/">as explained in the <em>Portland Press Herald</em></a>, is particularly troubling:</p>

<blockquote>Gov. Paul LePage’s joke about **shooting a political cartoonist** is falling flat.

The governor was laughing when he made the remark after the teenage son of *Bangor Daily News* cartoonist George Danby asked what LePage thought of his father’s satirical cartoons.</blockquote>

<p>So let&rsquo;s restate this for proper context: a few months after the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> shootings, Governor LePage made a joke about shooting a political cartoonist&hellip;to the cartoonist&rsquo;s teenage son. It should be noted that LePage (who is called &ldquo;LePlague&rdquo; by many Mainers) has also &ldquo;joked&rdquo; about blowing up a newspaper and punching a political columnist. I suppose it&rsquo;s too much to expect a subliterate man to understand the significance of using violent language, but someone on the governor&rsquo;s staff really must pull him aside and have a little talk about the fact that words have meaning. Use grunts and extravagant hand gestures, if necessary!</p>
