Back when he was just a presidential candidate, [I wrote about Donald Trump's love of the poem "The Snake."](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/08/12/what-donald-trumps-favorite-poem-tells-us-about-donald-trump/). Over the weekend, President Trump [read the poem again](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/01/politics/trump-the-snake/index.html). As Chris Cillizza points out, the poem has a very different meaning, now that Trump is Commander-in-Chief.
