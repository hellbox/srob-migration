**Monday June 12th: *The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.* Reading**</p>

<p class="noindent">
Seattle novelist Neal Stephenson’s follow-up to the magisterial *Seveneves* is a co-authored novel with Nicole Galland. It’s about a language expert who gets wrapped up in a secret government agency over some documents which supposedly prove that magic has always existed. Set in the near-future, this one looks like it might appeal to fans of Stephenson’s lighter side.<br/>*Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m.*
