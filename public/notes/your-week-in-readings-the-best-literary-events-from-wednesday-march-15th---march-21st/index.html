<p><p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday March 20th: <em>Free Women, Free Men</em> Reading **</h5></p>
 In the 1990s, Camille Paglia was kind of a big deal: she was a controversial feminist who seemingly never turned down an opportunity to speak publicly. She fell out of favor after the turn of the millennium, but as the ancient Chinese proverb goes, if you live long enough, you get to see yourself critically reappraised.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Tuesday March 21st: <em>Lovecraft Country</em> and <em>Everfair</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
The Seattle-based authors of two of last year’s best novels—not just sci-fi novels, mind you, but novels in general—share a stage at Elliott Bay tonight. Matt Ruff celebrates the recent paperback release of his novel-in-stories, <em>Lovecraft Country</em>. Nisi Shawl’s steampunk alternate history <em>Everfair</em> is still in hardcover, but it is worth every penny.
