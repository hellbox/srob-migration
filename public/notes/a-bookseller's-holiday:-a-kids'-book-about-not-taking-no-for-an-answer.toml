*(Every Monday in December, we're asking a local bookseller which books they'd like to receive for a holiday gift. Our second bookseller is Melissa Barnes, who works at University Book Store. Melissa chose* [Ada Twist, Scientist](http://www4.bookstore.washington.edu/_trade/ShowTitleUBS2.taf?ActionArg=Title&ISBN=9781419721373&SKU=2071178&sdb=ALL), *by Andrea Beaty and David Roberts.)*

After reading *Iggy Peck, Architect* and *Rosie Revere, Engineer*, I was dying to read this one, because the series is wonderful for parents and kids. I think it’s got a great positive message: Even though someone tells you can’t do something, you can. That’s what this book does: it tells this girl’s story, about how she perseveres and becomes a scientist. I think it’s wonderful. I love it a lot.
