Sponsor Paul Vidich's _An Honorable Man_ has been getting a great reception. It's Washington D.C., 1953, and any fan of spy novels knows that this time is pivotal in the espionage game. Russia in chaos after Stalin died, McCarthyism taking root at home, the Cold War starting its long tense march. 

We've [got a full chapter on our sponsor's page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) for you to read and see what you think. _An Honorable Man_ is the perfect Father's Day book, a taut thriller set in an important American past. 

It's thanks to sponsors like Paul Vidich, and readers like you, we sold out this season of our sponsorships. We couldn't be more thrilled.
