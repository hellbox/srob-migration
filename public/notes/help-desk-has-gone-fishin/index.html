<p>Cienna Madrid is on vacation this week, which means there is no new Help Desk. Please <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-help-desk/">peruse the Help Desk archives</a> for your advice fix; Cienna will return with a new column next week.</p>

<p>And if you have any book etiquette questions, you can always send them to advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com. Did you witness rude behavior at a bookstore? Do deckled edges detract from your enjoyment of a book? Are you sick of people opening their readings by talking about how boring readings are? Cienna can help. Send an email today.</p>
