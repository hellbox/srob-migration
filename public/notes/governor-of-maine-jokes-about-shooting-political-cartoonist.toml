The governor of my native state of Maine, Paul LePage, is unequivocally an imbecile. He's combative and unempathetic and ignorant and proud of it. He says terrible things on a very regular basis. But his most recent gaffe, [as explained in the *Portland Press Herald*](http://www.pressherald.com/2015/06/25/lepage-jokes-about-shooting-maine-political-cartoonist/), is particularly troubling:

<blockquote>Gov. Paul LePage’s joke about **shooting a political cartoonist** is falling flat.

The governor was laughing when he made the remark after the teenage son of *Bangor Daily News* cartoonist George Danby asked what LePage thought of his father’s satirical cartoons.</blockquote>

So let's restate this for proper context: a few months after the *Charlie Hebdo* shootings, Governor LePage made a joke about shooting a political cartoonist...to the cartoonist's teenage son. It should be noted that LePage (who is called "LePlague" by many Mainers) has also "joked" about blowing up a newspaper and punching a political columnist. I suppose it's too much to expect a subliterate man to understand the significance of using violent language, but someone on the governor's staff really must pull him aside and have a little talk about the fact that words have meaning. Use grunts and extravagant hand gestures, if necessary!
