<p>So the candidate<br>
Is less than candid<br>
And the office holder<br>
Heavy handed,</p>

<p>While the Senate<br>
Dabbles in senility<br>
And the city feeds<br>
On incivility.</p>

<p>When fact is fiction,<br>
Faction fact,<br>
What tribute<br>
Should the tribe exact?</p>

<p>Few words follow<br>
Veni vidi vici veto.<br>
Forensics<br>
Stuffs its face with Cheetos</p>

<p>Like rodents<br>
Gnawing at a rostrum.<br>
The Social Wars &mdash;<br>
Now thereâ€™s a custom</p>

<p>Any pleb can get behind.<br>
Time again to face the nation.<br>
One in ten<br>
Is decimation.</p>
