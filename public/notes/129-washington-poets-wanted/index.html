<p>Washington State Poet Laureate Tod Marshall <a href="http://wapoetlaureate.org/2016/03/18/call-for-submissions-washington-129/">announced</a> that he&rsquo;s looking for new poems <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwashingtonpoetlaureate.files.wordpress.com%2F2014%2F11%2Fwashington-129-call-for-submissions-print.pdf">(PDF)</a> from Washington poets for a book titled <em>Washington 129</em>. Unsurprisingly, he&rsquo;ll publish one poem from 129 different poets â€” that&rsquo;s one poet for each year of Washington&rsquo;s statehood. The gist of the announcement:</p>

<blockquote>*Washington 129* is accepting submissions until January 31, 2017. Previously published poems will not be considered. Please submit no more than three poems as a single Microsoft Word attachment or as the body of an email to submissions@humanities.org.</blockquote>
