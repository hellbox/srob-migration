<p class="intro">Each week, [Christine Marie Larsen](http://christinelarsen.com) creates a portrait of a new author for us. Have any favorites youâ€™d love to see immortalized? [Let us know](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about)</p>

<p>Judy Blume is certainly somebody we don&rsquo;t need to say very much about, other than tomorrow is her birthday. Millions of kids learned about themselves, and their friends, neighbors, and siblings through her empathetic and big-hearted works. If she were here, we&rsquo;d say thank you Judy Blume! We here at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> wish you a very happy birthday.</p>
