<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Dangerous Women: Tales of Queer Villainy!_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zan/dangerous-women-tales-of-queer-villainy?ref=category_location) We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Zan Christensen](http://northwestpress.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
Northwest Press is bringing you an awesome collection of 13 tales of queer female super-villainy from a roster of visionary writers.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    The innocuously named [Northwest Press](http://northwestpress.com/) has been cranking out LGBT focused comic books since 2010, under the inclusive banner "Comics are for everyone". If you can imagine a genre of comic, you will find it in their catalog, written with queer characters: from smutty erotica, to kids comics dealing with how to cope with bullying. 
</p>

<p>
    And now they're putting out their first prose collection together, and it looks great: thirteen short stories about queer villainy, written by women. Sounds great!
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Northwest Press knows what they're doing â€” they've been around for six years, and have many books in print, and the books they print are of great quality. Kickstarter is a perfect medium for presses this size: it gives them capital to produce the books to a known audience, and gives them a chance to prove their ideas in the marketplace before major outlays for production.
</p>

<p>
    So, great concept, great execution, and a Seattle press to boot. Sounds like a sure thing to me.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    63% there and 23 days to go. I'm sure they'll make it, so grab your copy while you can!
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
