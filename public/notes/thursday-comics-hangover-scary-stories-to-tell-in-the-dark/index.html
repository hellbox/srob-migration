<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta love a comics anthology built on a theme. There&rsquo;s something so conversational and warm and inquisitive about collections of short comics, particularly when they&rsquo;re all examining a particular idea from a wide variety of perspectives.</p>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1502346656239/notmysmalldiary.jpg)</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/533160008/new-not-my-small-diary-19-unexplained?ref=listing-shop-header-0">19th issue of <em>Not My Small Diary</em></a> — part of the My Small mini-empire created by Delaine Derry Green (the zine creator known best for her long-running series <em>My Small Diary</em>) — is an anthology of 43 autobiographical comics about unexplained events. As you might expect, the stories range from the outright supernatural (lots of ghost sightings) to the merely coincidental (immediately after having a dream about a mugger stealing $20 from them, a cartoonist is handed $20 by some random guy on the street.)</p>

<p>This particular issue of <em>Not My Small Diary</em> is loaded full of Seattle cartoonists including Noel Franklin, David Lasky, Kelly Froh, Donna Barr, Max Clotfelter, Colleen Frakes, Mark Campos, Ben Horak, and Roberta Gregory. It&rsquo;s with more than a little pride that I note that Seattle contributes some of the strongest pieces in the book, including Franklin&rsquo;s creepy crow story, Campos&rsquo;s short tale of the six words you&rsquo;d least like to hear from thin air in the dead of night, and Frakes&rsquo;s account of the time she accidentally entered into a family&rsquo;s haunted living situation.</p>

<p>Ranging in tone from skepticism to avid believer, these comics combine to form a wide-ranging study of experiences and feelings about paranormal activities. It&rsquo;s kind of like a long sleepless night swapping stories around the campfire. Some of the stories are total bullshit; others feel a little too true for comfort. No matter where you stand on UFOs and ghost stories, you&rsquo;ll find something to appreciate here.</p>
