<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

<p><strong>Do you have a favorite Christmas book?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Timothy, Licton Springs**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Timothy,</p>

<p>Yes, I do: David Sedaris&rsquo;s <em>Holidays on Ice</em>. But if you haven&rsquo;t read it, don&rsquo;t bother – <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/12/23/506475364/a-holiday-tradition-david-sedaris-reads-santaland-diaries">listen to Sedaris read <em>Santaland Diaries</em> instead</a>. Back before the internet consumed 90 percent of our collective attention, this was a highly anticipated Christmas tradition in my household. Sedaris is a powerful reader of his own work and my family had to tune in to NPR at just the right time to catch his dry retelling of what it&rsquo;s like to be a Macy&rsquo;s Christmas elf named Crumpet. His story will make you love elves, hate children and pity those who give birth to them.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

<p><strong>With all the GoFundMes and the Giving Tuesdays, I don’t know what to do with my charitable giving anymore. Do you have any ideas for which literary nonprofits are especially worth my time?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Don, Roosevelt**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Don,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of starting a nonprofit that would pay women to run around and give men titty twisters while screaming &ldquo;REPARATIONS!&rdquo; But until that gets off the ground, <a href="https://hugohouse.org/support-hugo-house/">Hugo House</a> is one of my personal favorites; <a href="http://fearlessideas.org/get_involved/donate/">The Greater Seattle Bureau of Fearless Ideas</a> (formerly 826Seattle) is fantastic; and <a href="https://co.clickandpledge.com/sp/d1/default.aspx?wid=47739">Seattle7Writers</a> is stacked with great people doing great work.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
