* Sherman Alexie is sharing a bill with Death Cab for Cutie's Ben Gibbard and [Naomi Wachira](http://www.naomiwachira.com/listen/) on Sunday, March 5th at the Showbox on 1st Avenue. This is a fundraiser benefitting Standing Rock and The Water Protector Legal Collective. Sherman Alexie is the only writer in the Northwest who can consistently share a stage with rock stars. This is worth your time, and it benefits a great cause. [Buy your tickets now](http://m.axs.com/events/331606/benjamin-gibbard-solo-tickets).

* Here's a book job that doesn't require you to move to New York City: Seattle-based press Sasquatch Books is hiring a Production Editor! [Here (PDF) is the job listing](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sasquatchbooks.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2013%2F07%2FProduction-Editor_Job-Desc.pdf). Applications are due by February 20th. But you probably shouldn't turn in your application on the last day, since editors are deadline-driven. So work on your resume this weekend and get it in on Monday.

* [Mark Campos at the *Seattle Weekly* this week](http://www.seattleweekly.com/comics/that-guy/) contributed a comic strip that pokes fun at *that guy* who asks *those* kinds of questions at readings. You know the guy. Yeah, him.
