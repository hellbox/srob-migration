<li><p>It&rsquo;s the beginning of book list season, which is a holiday that I must admit kind of befuddles me. I&rsquo;m not a list-maker. I find lists to be very unsatisfying. But many of you like them, and that is, of course, okay. I&rsquo;d like to direct your attention to two of the biggest lists of the season: The New York Public Library has published <a href="https://www.nypl.org/press/press-release/november-23-2016/new-york-public-library-reveals-its-list-best-books-kids-and">its list of the top books for kids and teens</a> and the <em>New York Times</em> published their <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/books/review/100-notable-books-of-2016.html?_r=0">100 Notable Books of 2016</a>. If you like your lists to be shorter and more local, the Seattle Public Library has published <a href="https://shelftalkblog.wordpress.com/2016/11/29/bus-reads-for-november/">a terrific list of three &ldquo;Bus Reads for November.&rdquo;</a> I&rsquo;m not going to link to every list on this site, but I&rsquo;ll make note of the especially worthy ones in days to come.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Hamilton</em> creator <a href="http://deadline.com/2016/11/lin-manuel-miranda-the-kingkiller-chronicle-movie-tv-show-1201861224/">Lin-Manuel Miranda has announced</a> that he&rsquo;s producing a TV and movie series based on the popular Kingkiller Chronicle fantasy trilogy.</p></li>

<li><p>An Amazon employee <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Amazon-worker-leaps-from-building-at-Seattle-10640986.php">leapt from a building on the online booksellers&rsquo; South Lake Union campus</a> yesterday after emailing a number of Amazon employees including founder Jeff Bezos. The person is in medical care with &ldquo;non-threatening injuries.&rdquo;</p></li>
