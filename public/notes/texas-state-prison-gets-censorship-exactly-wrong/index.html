<p>Michael Schaub writes a very appropriate Banned Books Week story for the <em>L.A. Times</em>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-texas-prisons-books-20160927-snap-story.html">Jacket Copy blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>If you're one of the more than 140,000 people doing time in a Texas state prison, you're not allowed to read books by Bob Dole, Harriet Beecher Stowe or Sojourner Truth. But you're more than welcome to dig into Adolf Hitler's "Mein Kampf" or David Duke's "My Awakening."</blockquote>

<p>If this story makes you mad, maybe consider donating to <a href="http://www.bookstoprisoners.net/">Seattle-based nonprofit Books to Prisoners</a>? They do good work delivering (non-Hitler-y) books to prisoners who need them.</p>
