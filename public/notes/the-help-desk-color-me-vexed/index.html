<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m a bookseller at an independent bookstore in Seattle. (No, not that one.) I&rsquo;m used to people having bad taste when it comes to books, but every time someone buys an adult coloring book from me, I become irrationally mad. It&rsquo;s getting so I can&rsquo;t even look them in the eyes anymore. I think they&rsquo;re a disgusting fad for rich people with way too much time on their hands. On the other hand, sales of adult coloring books are putting a roof over my head, so I probably shouldn&rsquo;t complain too much. How do I choke down this bile?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Juliet, Interbay**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Juliet,</p>

<p>I think adult coloring is supposed to sassy and therapeutic, like playing adult kickball or attending your coworker&rsquo;s cosplay divorce party. But I don&rsquo;t really get it either. I&rsquo;ve received two adult coloring books as gifts and have had to fight the urge to say, &ldquo;thanks but this isn&rsquo;t a real book.&rdquo; I suppose I know now how those &ldquo;one man, one woman&rdquo; marriage purists feel.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is, since we&rsquo;re losing this battle we might as well try to understand its appeal. Coloring seems to be therapy for adults who don&rsquo;t know how to address conflict with their words, so this week, I jotted down a few phrases that I said while in conversation with my neighbor and spiders, respectively, that I could tell irritated them but they were too polite to call me on.</p>

<p>Then I drew pictures of the phrases and gifted them to the offended parties, along with some chewed crayons I found. So far, neither has colored their drawings but I&rsquo;m sure once they do, they&rsquo;ll feel much better. And they will thank me for it.</p>

<p>I encourage you to try it, Juliet, and see if it helps with your bile issues. I&rsquo;m including copies of my drawings for you to practice on. Enjoy and remember: Get sassy with it! Those breasts don&rsquo;t have to be chicken colored, they can be any ol&rsquo; color you choose!</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>

<p class="noindent">P.S. For all you eagle-eyed art connoisseurs out there, yes, that is a Georgia O'Keeffe vagina on the back of that heifer.</p>

<p class="noindent">P.P.S. And yes, several spiders already pointed out that I don't know how to spell "heifer."</p>
