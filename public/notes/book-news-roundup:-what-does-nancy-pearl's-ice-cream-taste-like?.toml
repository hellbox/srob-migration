* Seattle ice creamery Full Tilt debuts a Nancy Pearl-themed ice cream on April 10th, [reports *Seattle Metropolitan*](http://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2016/3/11/full-tilt-gives-librarian-nancy-pearl-her-own-ice-cream-flavor). What does Nancy Pearl ice cream taste like? It's peanut butter with a fudge swirl.

* Harper Lee's estate has reportedly killed the mass-market edition of *To Kill a Mockingbird*. This is going to make the book inaccessible for public schools around the country. What's this mean? Alex Shephard at the *New Republic* writes:

<blockquote>Why does this matter? Mass-market books are significantly cheaper than their trade paperback counterparts. Hachette’s mass-market paperback of *TKAM* retails for $8.99, while the trade paperbacks published by Hachette’s rival HarperCollins go for $14.99 and $16.99.</blockquote>

* On Friday, [On the Media ran an excellent podcast about the publishing industry](http://www.onthemedia.org/story/why-publishing-industry-isnt-peril/), featuring interviews with experts about Amazon Books, e-book sales, and other topics. If you're looking for proof that the publishing industry's death has been greatly exaggerated, this podcast is a great place to start.

* And while we're talking about podcasts, [99% Invisible's most recent episode](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-giftschrank/) explains the culture that has built up around *Mein Kampf* in post-war Germany. German libraries have a system for dealing with books about sensitive topics. They store the books in what's called a "Giftschrank."

<blockquote>The word, a combination of “poison” and “cabinet,” has a variety of meanings in different contexts. At its most literal, a Giftschrank is a space for storing controlled substances in places like pharmacies. Colloquially, it can refer to spaces reserved for all kinds of hidden and forbidden objects, ideas or stories.</blockquote>
