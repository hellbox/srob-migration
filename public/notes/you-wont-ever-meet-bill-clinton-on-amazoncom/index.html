<p>Former president Bill Clinton, who is in town for a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s presidential campaign, just stopped by Elliott Bay Book Company.</p>

<p>This is not Clinton&rsquo;s first visit to Elliott Bay, though it is quite possibly his first since the store moved to Capitol Hill in 2010. Clinton visited Elliott Bay in Pioneer Square at least once while he was sitting president, and he did at least one signing there, for his (incredibly dull) memoir <em>My Life</em>.</p>

<p>While Clinton was browsing today, he introduced himself to a few people who happened to be browsing at an independent bookstore in the afternoon:</p>

<p>And he recommended some books:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bill Clinton recommended the books “Jacksonland” and also Seattle author James Neff’s “Vendetta” (about Hoffa &amp; RFK) <a href="https://t.co/dbfGrv6bgT">pic.twitter.com/dbfGrv6bgT</a></p>&mdash; Elliott Bay Book Co.

<p>We have not yet read <em>Jacksonland</em>, but we can confirm Clinton&rsquo;s good taste with regard to <em>Vendetta</em>: I <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/whats-one-more-american-death-give-or-take/">reviewed that one on its release back in August</a>. It&rsquo;s a really good book.</p>
