<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>I turn 50 next year. Will I ever be able to alphabetize my bookshelves without singing the A-B-Cs to myself?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Barbara, Queen Anne</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Barbara,</p>

<p class="noindent">Normally, I save lectures on the patriarchy – my albatross, my muse – for more appropriate arenas, like weddings, first dates, or when any fool I call friend ignores their parental instincts and asks me to watch their children for an evening.</p>

<p>But you do not need an alphabetized library in order to be happy, no matter what Melvil Dewey – A MAN – or the thousands of librarians chained to his decimal system will tell you. The perception that we need the &ldquo;alphabet&rdquo; in order to tame our collections is socially structured and enforced by the patriarchy. RESIST. The alphabet contributes to our oppression – just think of &ldquo;woMAN&rdquo; and all the English words like spinster, nag, and nymphomaniac that are gendered slurs with no male equivalent.</p>

<p>There are better ways to organize books you love – for instance, the internet suggests by color, height, or how &ldquo;woke&rdquo; the author is. I have bookshelves in half the rooms in my house and this is how they&rsquo;re arranged: My bedroom books are books I do not lend out; my living room and bathroom books are fine for anyone to read; and my guest bedroom books are either duplicates of beloved books (the lendable copies) or books I enjoyed but am happy to pass on if a special guest wants to take one. As a fun twist, I&rsquo;ve begun further arranging my guest bedroom books by the first word in their titles, so each shelf secretly spells out a fun message:</p>

<p class="noindent">FEMALE EJACULATION IS REAL</p>
<p class="noindent">DO NOT OVER STAY YOUR WELCOME</p>
<p class="noindent">I AM WATCHING YOU</p>
<p class="noindent">SLEEP TIGHT</p>

<p>You are nearly 50 years old, which means you have lived through many waves of feminism without drowning. Congratulations! Now go burn a bra (or put on two, whatever) and experiment with ordering your books in a way that has never occurred to you before. If, in the end, you find that you are most comfortable in the chains of your oppression, that&rsquo;s fine, too. Just chant, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a strong, independent womyn, and I adopt these chains as my jewelry because this is how I like my books arranged. A, B, C, D&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
