<li><p>Push/Pull, the art gallery and comics shop in Ballard, is launching the 2018 edition of their book club tomorrow at 11 am. Their first book club selection, <em>Everfair</em>, culminated in <a href="https://www.ballardnightout.com/ballard-night-out/everfair-art-opening-w-reading-by-author-nisi-shawl-pushpull">an art show with an appearance by Seattle author (and <em>SRoB</em> contributor) Nisi Shawl</a>. This year&rsquo;s selection is Nick Joaquin&rsquo;s <em>The Woman Who Had Two Navels &amp; Tales of the Tropical Gothic</em>, and the book club will again conclude in an art show in May. The book club will meet twice a month through March and there will also be an online component for people who can&rsquo;t make it to every meeting. <a href="https://pushpullseattle.weebly.com/book-club-2018.html">Find more information and sign up for the book club on Push/Pull&rsquo;s site</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>I asked Maxx, the director at Push/Pull, how she selected that particular book for the book club, and she said she encountered Joaquin through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/books/review/nick-joaquin-the-woman-who-had-two-navels-and-tales-of-the-tropical-gothic.html">this <em>New York Times</em> article</a> last year. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a book that has changed the way that I see the world and I&rsquo;m eager to discuss it with other people,&rdquo; she writes. I&rsquo;d never heard about this book before, but it sounds fascinating.</p></li>

<li><p>The Hugo House has a pair of opportunities that you should know about. They&rsquo;re now <a href="https://hugohouse.org/get-involved/made-hugo-house/">accepting applications for their Made at Hugo House Fellowships</a>, which is a fantastic support program for emerging young Seattle writers. And they&rsquo;re also looking for their <a href="https://hugohouse.org/get-involved/writers-in-residence/">next prose Writer in Residence</a>. Applications for both these opportunities are due on March 31st. Don&rsquo;t procrastinate, okay?</p></li>

<li><p><em>Spartan</em>, a very good local literary magazine, is <a href="https://twitter.com/Spartan_Lit/status/948671918785273856">now accepting submissions for its spring issue</a>. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to say this, but <strong>please read an issue or two before you submit</strong>; <em>Spartan</em> is a free magazine so there&rsquo;s really no reason for you not to do your research.</p></li>
