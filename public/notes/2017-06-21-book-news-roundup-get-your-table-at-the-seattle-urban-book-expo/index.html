<li><p>The Seattle Urban Book Expo is happening on August 26th at Washington Hall. &ldquo;Last October, the authors and the people showed out and declared that black literature has a place in our community. So much so, that we had to do it again,&rdquo; SUBE founders write on their Facebook page. If you&rsquo;d like to get a table to exhibit at this year&rsquo;s SUBE, you should <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SUBE2016/posts/1909407109301482">send organizers an email and follow the instructions on this post</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Local sci-fi writing organization Clarion West is offering up some neat-looking one-day writing classes this fall, including one on world-building and one class taught by the great Nicola Griffith. <a href="http://hosted.verticalresponse.com/1806469/43be28b6b5/578579385/0e53f52d03/">You can sign up right here</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Here&rsquo;s a neat idea that may or may not turn into something: <a href="http://bookshelf.website/">Bookshelf is a website</a> that lets you construct &ldquo;book mix tapes&rdquo; to share with friends. You can also read through mix tapes made by other readers. And here&rsquo;s a nice touch: rather than the ubiquitous links to Amazon you&rsquo;ll find all over the internet, Bookshelf links to Indiebound, which allows you to buy books from independent bookseller.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard Ebooks</a> takes the free-e-library spirit of Project Gutenberg and pairs it with a good sense of design.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Ebook projects like Project Gutenberg transcribe ebooks and make them available for the widest number of reading devices. Standard Ebooks takes ebooks from sources like Project Gutenberg, formats and typesets them using a carefully designed and professional-grade style guide, lightly modernizes them, fully proofreads and corrects them, and then builds them to take advantage of state-of-the-art ereader and browser technology.</blockquote>
