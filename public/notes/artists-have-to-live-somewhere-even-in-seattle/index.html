<p>Local writer Anca Szilagyi just published <a href="http://ancawrites.com/2015/08/20/affordable-housing-in-seattle/">a list of resources for people who need affordable housing options in Seattle</a>. Szilagyi says she thinks about affordable housing, in part, &ldquo;because I’m a writer with writer and artist friends.&rdquo; This is an issue we&rsquo;ve talked about before in the <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/exit-interview-talking-with-kate-lebo-about-why-she-left-seattle-for-spokane/">first installment of our Exit Interview series</a>, and we&rsquo;ll be addressing it more in the future.</p>
