<p class="intro">On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our second suggested itinerary:</p>

You could attend a whole evening's worth of poetry readings at Lit Crawl with a nice mix of new, up-and-coming, and established names, providing an excellent cross-section of where Northwest poetry is right now.

**1**. Up at the Sorrento Hotel, Rebekah Anderson hosts a curiosity-themed evening of poetry with readers [Lucy Hitz](https://twitter.com/LLHitz?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Jourdan Keith](https://jourdankeith.wordpress.com/about/), and [Maggie Hess](http://dearmrpostman.com/i-already-love-you-come-party-with-me/).

**2**. Chances are good you've already attended Cheap Wine & Poetry. It's just probability in action: Hugo House is always packed full of people during CW&P, and the series has been going on for years so it's likely you were in that crowd at some point. This special Lit Crawl edition of CW&P features wine at a buck a glass and readings from [Arlene Kim](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/22/ten-thousand-saw-i-at-a-glance/), [Matt Gano](http://www.mattgano.com/), and Seattle Civic Poet [Claudia Castro Luna](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/03/claudia-castro-luna-is-seattles-new-civic-poet/), with host Jeanine Walker.

**3**. Storied poetry journal *Poetry Northwest* caps your poetry adventure at Sole Repair, with readings from [Clare Johnson](http://www.clarejohnson.com/biography.php), [Suzanne Bottelli](http://kathleenflenniken.com/blog/?p=1527), and [Emily Bedard](http://kathleenflenniken.com/blog/?tag=emily-bedard). *Poetry Northwest* editor Kevin Craft will host the evening.
