<p>Every year, VIDA &ldquo;examine[s] race and ethnicity, gender, sexual identity and ability&rdquo; by counting the demographics of literary institutions like awards and magazines. Their <a href="http://www.vidaweb.org/the-2015-vida-count/">2015 Count</a> examines literary magazines and review outlets, and the news is&hellip;[drumroll]&hellip;<a href="http://www.vidaweb.org/the-2015-vida-count/">at least partially good</a>!</p>

<blockquote><p>Our Larger Literary Landscape count is in its third year, and we are seeing results worth celebrating!</p>

<p>Of the 26 publications in our 2015 Larger Literary Landscape Count, 15 of them published as many bylines by women writers as men, or more! We are celebrating *A Public Space* (72%), *The Normal School* (69%), *Crab Orchard Review* (64%), *Jubilat* (59%), *Ninth Letter* (59%), *Cincinnati Review* (58%), *N+1* (57%), *Conjunctions* (56%), *Gettysburg Review* (55%), *Kenyon Review* (55%), *Prairie Schooner* (54%), *Colorado Review* (53%), *Missouri Review* (52%), *Pleiades* (50%), and *Harvard Review* (50%).</p></blockquote>

<p>This is wonderful news. Of course, plenty of publications are nowhere near achieving gender/race/ability parity, and they&rsquo;re identified in this report as well. I suggest you <a href="http://www.vidaweb.org/the-2015-vida-count/">go and spend some time with these infographics</a>, which are fascinating. It&rsquo;s only by counting, by making a conscious effort to ensure that people are included, that we&rsquo;ll start to see significant change in the literary world. In fact, we&rsquo;re starting to see these changes already.</p>

<p>On this site&rsquo;s first day of publication, we <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/27/talking-with-nicola-griffith-about-the-importance-of-counting-womens-stories/">ran an interview with the wonderful Nicola Griffith on why this is so important</a>. If you&rsquo;d like to thank VIDA for institutionalizing this kind of thinking, and for encouraging demographic parity in the literary world, they&rsquo;re <a href="https://www.generosity.com/fundraising/fund-vida-s-present-and-future">running an Indiegogo campaign right now</a>. Your donation would ensure that work like this continues into the future.</p>
