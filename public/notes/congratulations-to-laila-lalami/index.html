<p>On Twitter, the delightful author Laila Lalami <a href="http://lailalalami.com/the-moors-account/about/">announced</a> that her historical novel <a href="http://lailalalami.com/the-moors-account/about/"><em>The Moorâ€™s Account</em></a> &ldquo;is the recipient of an American Book Award.&rdquo; <em>Account</em> was also shortlisted for a Pulitzer this past year; you should probably read it, is my point.</p>
