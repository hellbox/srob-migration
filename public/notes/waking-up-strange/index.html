<p>Don’t sleep in a parked car.<br>
You awake, windows fogged, hands on the wheel,<br>
the dash and controls suddenly foreign,</p>

<p>like a safe word repeated too often. What queer<br>
drives brought you here? You hurtle ahead but the car<br>
is still. You wake up turning the wheel</p>

<p>and avoiding its meaning. Turning a pink plastic wheel.<br>
Pounding a rubber clown horn like a little girl. And harbor strange<br>
fears of waking up driving. Of waking up lost. You awake in a car</p>

<p>and can’t find your car. Turn the wheel and it locks. You’re an alien.</p>
