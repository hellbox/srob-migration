<p>Last night <a href="http://igniteseattle.com/2015/08/21/full-speaker-list-and-tickets-for-seattle-ignite-28/">at Ignite Seattle</a>, I officially announced the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>&rsquo;s newest feature: <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/resources/">the Resources page</a>. On this page, you&rsquo;ll find dozens of ways to get involved with Seattle&rsquo;s literary community: literary magazines, open mic nights, literary news sources, book clubs, literary happy hours, places to volunteer, places to take classes. If you&rsquo;re new to town or you&rsquo;re just looking to get a little more serious about your commitment to literature, you&rsquo;ll find all sorts of ways to join the literary scene. (And if you&rsquo;re part of a resource that you want our readers to know about, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/">please contact us</a>. We&rsquo;ll be happy to add you to the page.)</p>

<p>Seattle is right now the most exciting literary city in America, and there are so many ways to participate, as a reader or a writer or someone who just arrived in Seattle, or just as someone who likes to be around people who like books. Whoever you are, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/resources/">the Resource page</a> is for you.</p>
