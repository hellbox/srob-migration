Sarrocco's poetry are little stories, startling, direct, accessible, graceful, and eminamently well-handled. We're so excited to have her here, and have three poems on our sponsor page <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">for you to read</a>.
