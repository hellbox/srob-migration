        <p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday May 17th: SAL Presents: The Moth**</h5></p> 
The Moth has become a preeminent name in storytelling, and Seattle Arts and Lectures brings some of the best storytellers to town. Regular Moth host Dan Kennedy presents musician Andy Fischer-Price, veteran and state department employee Laurence Kerr, artist Jessica Lee Williamson, and Seattle’s own Ijeoma Oluo, who is quickly (and rightfully) achieving national prominence.
*Benaroya Hall,  200 University St., 215-4747, https://www.lectures.org. $35. All ages. 7:30 p.m.* 
 
 <p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday May 18th: *Everfair* Exhibit Opening**</h5></p>
Sci-fi novelist Nisi Shawl’s *Everfair* was one of the best books to be published by a Seattle author last year. Tonight, it inspires a whole new generation of Seattle art. Push/Pull gallery presents new work by Seattle artists inspired by Shawl’s steampunk alternate history of the Congo. Shawl will be in attendance. 
*Push/Pull, 5484 Shilshole Ave N.W., 789-1710, http://pushpullseattle.weebly.com/. Free. All ages. 6 p.m. *
 
<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday May 19th: Jack Straw Writing Fellows**</h5></p> 
Every year, a curator chooses a group of Seattle writers to learn how to do a better job of reading their work, both live and in audio recordings. This year a handful of authors selected by Jourdan Imani Keith will present their latest work and show off what they’ve learned. Readers tonight include Ellie Belew, Hera McLeod, Ashlan Runyan, and the fabulous Quenton Baker.
*Jack Straw Gallery, 4261 Roosevelt Way N.E., 634-0919, http://jackstraw.org. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday May 20th: Mancini/Nufer**</h5></p> 
Vancouver poet Donato Mancini is reading twice in Seattle to celebrate his new book, *Same Diff*. He’ll be joined by irrepressible Seattle poet Doug Nufer, who will soon be releasing a new poetry collection of his own, titled *The Me Theme*. Why not spend your afternoon with two very fine Cascadian poets?
*Open Books, 2414 N. 45th St., 633-0811, http://openpoetrybooks.com. Free. All ages. 2 p.m.*

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Sunday May 21st: <em>Apollo 8</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
<em>Apollo 8: The Thrilling Story of the First Mission to the Moon</em> is about a horrendous year in American history (almost exactly 50 years ago now) when we decided to send human beings to the goddamned moon. Maybe the problem with this horrendous year in American history is we’re not shooting enough people into space.
<em>Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave., 624-6600, <a href="http://elliottbaybook.com">http://elliottbaybook.com</a>. Free. All ages. 3 p.m. </em></p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Monday May 22nd: <em>SCALE</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Now more than ever in these Trumpy times, it’s important to give scientists your attention. Tonight, according to press materials, a theoretical physicist named Geoffrey West “explores the hidden laws that govern the lifecycle of everything from plants and animals to our cities in his new book.”
*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave., 624-6600, <a href="http://elliottbaybook.com">http://elliottbaybook.com</a>. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. * </p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Tuesday May 23rd: King County Libraries Fundraiser</strong></h5></p>
Spokane author Jess Walter is one of the most charming and funny authors you’ll ever see in person. Tonight, he’ll share the stage with Lark chef John Sundstrom for a fancy meal and a conversation moderated by yours truly as a fundraiser for King County Libraries. It’s for a great cause, and it will be great fun.
<em>Lark, 952 E. Seneca St., 323-5275, <a href="http://kclsfoundation.org">http://kclsfoundation.org</a>. $200. All ages. 6 p.m.</em></p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Alternate Tuesday May 23rd: <em>The Biographies of Ordinary People</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Since the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> is affiliated with the previous event (and since it’s a very expensive fundraiser), allow me to suggest an alternate reading. Seattle author Nicole Dieker, whose excellent writing you can find almost every day at The Billfold, debuts her first novel at this launch party. Dieker has been very open about the process of self-publishing the book, and anyone looking to learn how to get their writing out there should be paying attention.
<em>Phinney Books, 7405 Greenwood Ave. N., 297-2665, <a href="http://phinneybooks.com">http://phinneybooks.com</a>. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. </em></p>
