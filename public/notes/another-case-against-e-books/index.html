If you own a Nook e-reader, that could turn out to be a real problem. For one thing, you might not be able to access your books anymore. For another thing&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>...if you should have to reset a Nook UK device in June, **you won't be able to reauthorize it** to the same account. And if someone gives you a Nook UK device in June or later, you won't be able to log in using your current credentials.

And since B&N **requires that a Nook device be authorized** before you can use it, that is a problem.</blockquote>

<p>Not to be a dick, but you literally never have to worry about this kind of thing with physical books.</p>
