<p>I use a trick to teach students<br>
how to avoid passive voice.</p>

<p>Circle the verbs.<br>
Imagine inserting “by zombies”<br>
after each one.</p>

<p>Have the words been claimed<br>
by the flesh-hungry undead?<br>
If so, passive voice.</p>

<p>I wonder if these<br>
sixth graders will recollect,<br>
on summer vacation,<br>
as they stretch their legs<br>
on the way home<br>
from Yellowstone or Yosemite<br>
and the byway’s historical marker<br>
beckons them to the<br>
site of an Indian village &mdash;</p>

<p>Where <em>trouble was brewing</em>.<br>
Where, <em>after further hostilities, the army was directed to enter</em>.<br>
Where <em>the village was razed after the skirmish occurred</em>.<br>
Where <em>most were women and children</em>.</p>

<p>Riveted bramble of passive verbs<br>
etched in wood &mdash;<br>
stripped hands<br>
breaking up from the dry ground<br>
to pinch the meat<br>
of their young red tongues.</p>
