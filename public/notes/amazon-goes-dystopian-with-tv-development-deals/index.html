<p>Holy cow: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/29/16384276/snow-crash-series-amazon-ringworld-lazarus">Amazon announced yesterday</a> that they&rsquo;re adapting Seattle author Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s sci-fi classic <em>Snow Crash</em> into a TV series. And they also announced that they&rsquo;re adapting Portland comics writer Greg Rucka&rsquo;s comic with artist Michael Lark, the dystopian bioengineering epic <em>Lazarus</em>, as a series, too. And they <em>also</em> announced that they&rsquo;re adapting Larry Niven&rsquo;s <em>Ringworld</em> series into a TV series. I can&rsquo;t say that I think <em>Snow Crash</em> should be a series — I don&rsquo;t even know if it would be an effective movie; I think it&rsquo;s better left as a novel that was ahead of its time when it was published — but the other two are ripe for serialized storytelling. As much as I hate to admit it, I think Amazon&rsquo;s television arm is really on to something here.</p>
