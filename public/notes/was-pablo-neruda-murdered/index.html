<p>The Associated Press <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/3f3a5f5b104c4ae8bc85ec5718d7ea11/chile-poet-pablo-neruda-might-have-been-killed">says</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Chile's government is acknowledging that Nobel-prize winning poet Pablo Neruda might have been killed after the 1973 coup that brought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to power.</p>

<p>The Interior Ministry released a statement Thursday amid press reports that Neruda might not have died of cancer.</p></blockquote>

<p>The statement, in fact, says it&rsquo;s &ldquo;clearly possible and highly probable&rdquo; that the poet was murdered. Hopefully, at least, morbid curiosity will drive new fans to Neruda&rsquo;s work. He&rsquo;s certainly been in the news a lot recently; Washington&rsquo;s own <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/24/rediscovered-pablo-neruda-poems-to-be-published/">Copper Canyon Press</a> revealed in July that they&rsquo;re publishing a new volume of &ldquo;rediscovered&rdquo; Neruda poems early next year. All this attention might mean Neruda will top the bestseller list again. Dictators of the world will never learn that <strong>you can&rsquo;t kill a poet&rsquo;s work</strong> — by killing the person, you only give their words more power.</p>
