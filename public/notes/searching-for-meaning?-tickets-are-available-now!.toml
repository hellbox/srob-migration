Seattle University's [Search for Meaning festival](http://www.seattleu.edu/searchformeaning/about/) is an underrated event in Seattle's literary calendar. Past speakers at the festival, which began in 2009, include Michael Chabon, Sherman Alexie, Reza Aslan, and Anne LaMott. This year's Search for Meaning slate includes spiritual writer [Tracy Kidder](http://www.tracykidder.com/); [Suki Kim](http://www.sukikim.com/), who went undercover in North Korea and lived to tell the tale; and journalist [Sam Qui√±ones](http://www.samquinones.com/). Tickets for this year's festival are $10, and they're [available right now](https://www.regonline.com/Register/Checkin.aspx?EventID=1787722). Besides those three authors, you'll also have access to a full day's worth of presentations, lectures, over 50 authors, signings, and a book fair.
