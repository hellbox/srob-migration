<p>Shelf Awareness <a href="http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2581#m29620">published</a> an account of two Washington state booksellers who recently had to close due to rampant wildfires. One of the bookstores, Winthrop&rsquo;s delightful <a href="http://www.trailsendbookstore.com/">Trail&rsquo;s End</a>, is open again and &ldquo;plans to donate proceeds from coffee sales at its espresso bar to vetted fire relief funds.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re ever in the Methow Valley, you should go out of your way to visit Trail&rsquo;s End; it&rsquo;s a delightful and well-stocked little shop. We&rsquo;re glad to hear they&rsquo;re all okay and back to serving the community.</p>
