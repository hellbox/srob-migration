<p>Many thanks to <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2017/06/donald_trump_inspires_a_surge_in_book_clubs.html">Ruth Graham at <em>Slate</em></a> for citing our book club as the first example in her article about reading and resistance in the age of Trump:</p>

<blockquote>Some independent bookstores, progressive media outlets, and activist groups have launched new clubs to meet the moment. In Seattle there’s “Reading Through It: A Post-Election Book Club.” (First selection: J.D. Vance’s [*Hillbilly Elegy*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/12/08/thank-you-for-coming-to-the-first-reading-through-it-book-club/), a memoir of growing up in a poor white family in what is now Trump country.) </blockquote>

<p>There may or may not be a few other media mentions of Reading Through It in the pipeline. If you want to see what all the buzz is about, we&rsquo;re meeting next Wednesday, the 5th of July, in our usual location (Third Place Books Seward Park) at the usual time (7 p.m.). This time, we&rsquo;ll be discussing Jane Mayer&rsquo;s brilliant dissection of the right-wing Koch-powered political money machine, <em>Dark Money</em>. If you buy it at Third Place Books Seward Park, it&rsquo;ll be 20 percent off until the night of the event.</p>

<p>Also, you should like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/readingthroughit/">the Reading Through It Facebook page</a> and continue the discussion all month long.</p>
