<p>For years, Amazon has offered commissions to book bloggers who link to books on Amazon. In other words, if you were reading a review on a blog and you clicked the link on the blog to buy that book on Amazon, you&rsquo;d be sending a small amount of money the bloggers&rsquo; way. It&rsquo;s called the affiliate program. Some book blogs have grown to depend on affiliate revenue over the years, and Amazon relied on affiliates to serve, effectively, as handsellers for the company.</p>

<p>As of today, that deal has changed. <a href="http://the-digital-reader.com/2017/02/24/say-good-bye-book-ebook-bloggers-amazon-changed-fee-schedule-affiliate-program/">Nate Hoffelder at The Digital Reader notes</a> that Amazon is cutting the amount they pay to affiliates by a significant amount:</p>

<blockquote>Amazon is saying that they don't want to pay as much they used to; they no longer value the more active affiliates. That is their right; Amazon is in business to make money, and I can understand why they made this decision...I have been crunching my numbers, and **I expect to lose about a fifth of my Amazon affiliate income**. That's going to hurt, and I won't be the only one to feel the pinch.</blockquote>

<p>This is what happens when you&rsquo;re the only game in town: when you decide to change the rules, there&rsquo;s nothing anyone else can do.</p>

<p>What does this mean for you? Well, it&rsquo;s likely there&rsquo;ll be even fewer book blogs for you to read in the months and years to come. A few of those bloggers are in the comments on the Digital Reader post. One notes, &ldquo;Lots of people wanted to believe Amazon was altruistic and a force for good in the publishing world. Well it ain’t, and we’re seeing it more and more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If your business relies on Amazon — whether you&rsquo;re a self-publisher or an affiliate or a used bookseller — you should remember that: pretty much everybody who partners with Amazon gets the shaft eventually.</p>

IndieBound does provide an affiliate-like service, meaning if you were to buy a book through a link on our site, we'd get a (very small) amount in return. It's not part of our operating budget at all.
