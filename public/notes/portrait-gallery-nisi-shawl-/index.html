<p><h5><strong>Saturday, December 2nd:  Healing Histories</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent"><em>Everfair</em> novelist, much-anthologized short story author, and <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> columnist Nisi Shawl teaches a free writing class in the Green Lake branch of the Seattle Public Library. What the hell could you possibly have to lose? For the low, low price of free, Shawl will almost certainly leave you a better author than you were when you walked into the room.<br />
<em>Seattle Public Library, Green Lake Branch, 7364 East Green Lake Dr N, <a href="http://spl.org">http://spl.org</a>, 2 pm, free.</em></p></p>
