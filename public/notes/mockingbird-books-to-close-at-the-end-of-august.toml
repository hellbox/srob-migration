Children's bookseller Mockingbird Books just announced that after eight years of selling books to the Green Lake neighborhood, they'll be closing at the end of this month. They [cited a very simple reason](https://t.e2ma.net/webview/8kkig/f9da08e0565ae4bd13653d9f0f40fcd3): "the gross sales for at least this retail store no longer cover the overhead to allow continued operation." They continue:

<blockquote> Our last day of operations will be Saturday, August 27 and we have a celebration planned, so please join us.  Please use any outstnding gift certificates or frequent buyer discounts by August 27.  All sales from now until store closing will be final and any special orders should be prepaid.</blockquote>
