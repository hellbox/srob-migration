<p>Here&rsquo;s a painting of Seattle&rsquo;s own beloved son Ivar Haglund. Folk singer, restauranteur, accidental port commissioner, trouble-maker, inveterate punner (he&rsquo;s listed as the &ldquo;flounder&rdquo; of his seafood restaurant, Ivar&rsquo;s), and of mixed Scandehoovian lineage (his mother was Norwegian and his father was Swedish, nearly a Capulet/Montague situation). On Sunday, come to the <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/01/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-february-1st-7th/">West Seattle branch of the Seattle Public Library</a> to hear historian Paul Dorpat discuss Haglund&rsquo;s life and legacy.</p>
