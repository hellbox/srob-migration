The author of *To Kill a Mockingbird* — and, so far as I'm concerned, the author of [only *To Kill a Mockingbird*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/10/dont-set-a-watchman/) — has [died at age 89](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/19/harper-lee-author-to-kill-a-mockingbird-dies-alabama?CMP=twt_books-gdnbooks). 

Those who believe the Great American Novel is a singular experience have it wrong; there are many Great American Novels, each a timeless snapshot of a particular moment in American history. Of that tradition of Great American Novels, *To Kill a Mockingbird* is one of the very best, because it delivered the America that we all — Northern or Southern, black or white, woman or man — aspire to create. In one book, Harper Lee gave us the possibility and the promise of America. We could never possibly begin repay her for that tremendous achievement.
