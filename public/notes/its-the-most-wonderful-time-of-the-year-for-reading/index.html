<p>This <a href="http://mcphee.com/shop/introvert-ornament.html#Details">&ldquo;Introvert&rdquo; Christmas ornament</a> from Archie McPhee, featuring a bespectacled reader hiding behind a book, seems like the sort of thing that readers of this site might enjoy. (They&rsquo;re not a bookstore, but the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> still loves the ever-loving hell out of Archie McPhee.)</p>
