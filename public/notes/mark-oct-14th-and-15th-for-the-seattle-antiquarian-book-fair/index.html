<p class="noindent">Sponsor [Seattle Antiquarian Book Fair](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/) is back this week to make sure you're holding a spot for them on your calendar â€” and you definitely should be. The annual event brings "the best bookstore in America" to the Seattle Center's Exhibition Hall, packing it with books and book lovers.</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s Book Fair is October 14th and 15th. Just $5 gets you entry on both days, with access to more than a hundred exhibitors from the United States, Canada, England, and Spain, sharing rarities, collectibles, and ephemera. You won&rsquo;t want to miss it.</p>

<p>Sponsors like the Seattle Antiquarian Book Fair make the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> possible. Did you know we sold out our last sponsorship run? We&rsquo;re booked solid through the end of January, but if you have a book, event, or project you&rsquo;d like to get in front of our readers, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/">reach out and let us know</a>. We&rsquo;ll be happy to crack open our calendars and reserve you ahead of the pack.</p>
