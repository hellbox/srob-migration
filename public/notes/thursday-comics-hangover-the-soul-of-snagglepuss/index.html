<p>I have <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/08/25/thursday-comics-hangover-the-bedrock-of-our-society/">written about how good the <em>Flintstones</em> comic</a> is, but it has to be noted that the most recent issue, #8, is the best, most ambitious edition yet. It satirizes gender roles, economics, politics, and celebrity, and it also contains a great little story about how the ultimate goal of parenting should be to fuck the next generation up slightly less than your own.</p>

<p>My favorite part of the new issue is when a guest speaker named &ldquo;Thorstone Pebblen&rdquo; discusses &ldquo;a brand-new field of research called &lsquo;economics.&rsquo;&rdquo; He explains it thusly: &ldquo;When you trick somebody into participating in a small-time fraud, it&rsquo;s called a &lsquo;scam.&rsquo; But when the scam is so big that people have no choice but to participate, it&rsquo;s called &lsquo;economics.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>While underrated artist Steve Pugh is doing incredible work balancing the many tone considerations of the book, a vast share of the credit for this comic&rsquo;s success has to go to writer Mark Russell, who is somehow simultaneously paying homage to the old <em>Flintstones</em> cartoon&rsquo;s history of social satire while also forging his own path.</p>

<p>And then two days ago, Russell <a href="http://hilobrow.com/2017/01/23/this-look-at-those-cavemen-go/">revealed in an interview with <em>HiLoBrow</em></a> that he&rsquo;s reimagining the Hanna Barbera cartoon character Snagglepuss as &ldquo;a gay Southern Gothic playwright.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote> I envision him like a tragic Tennessee Williams figure; Huckleberry Hound is sort of a William Faulkner guy, they’re in New York in the 1950s, Marlon Brando shows up, Dorothy Parker, these socialites of New York from that era come and go.</blockquote>

<p>This news spread on Twitter, but I couldn&rsquo;t quite believe it was true. It sounded too good, right? It had to be a joke, right?</p>

<p>Not so much. Yesterday afternoon, DC Comics released a page from the upcoming <em>Snagglepuss</em> comic, with art by Howard Porter. Click to enlarge this:</p>

<p>In the <em>HiLoBrow</em> interview, Russell calls <em>Snagglepuss</em> &ldquo;very different from <em>The Flintstones</em>, it’s more about the creative process; much more of an intimate story.&rdquo; If he pulls this one off, Russell is going to be one of my favorite contemporary comics writers. In an ever-churning content world of reboots and reimaginings, he&rsquo;s doing the unthinkable: he&rsquo;s taking exhausted corporate IP and making it more personal, more thoughtful, and more relevant.</p>
