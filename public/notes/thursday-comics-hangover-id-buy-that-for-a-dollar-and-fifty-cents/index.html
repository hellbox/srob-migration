<p>Last year, small press comics publisher Alterna Comics began <a href="https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/01/03/alterna-make-comics-affordable-2017-newsprint-2-prices/">publishing a line of cheap comics</a>. Printed on flimsy newsprint, these books sold for $1.50 a pop — about half the price of the cheapest monthly comics published by the big two mainstream publishers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most of what I&rsquo;ve seen from Alterna Comics hasn&rsquo;t blown me away. One comic, <em>Amazing Age</em> is clearly playing for a noxious kind of superhero nostalgia. It reads like a Marvel Comic from the 1980s  with worse art — full of self-referential superhero action with no depth or consequences. The comic appeared to be designed to appeal to the grown men who remember spending $1.50 per issue on comics, and really nobody else.</p>

<p>But at least one of Alterna Comics&rsquo;s line has very much impressed me with its wicked sense of genre fun. Written by Jordan Hart and illustrated by Emmanuel Xerx Javier, the four-issue miniseries titled <em>Doppelgänger</em> tells the story of a bland computer programmer named Dennis who finds himself copied by an ancient, evil magical creature. The Dennisgänger takes over Dennis&rsquo;s suburban life, sleeping with his wife and playing role playing games with his friends.</p>

<p>The second issue of <em>Doppelgänger</em> landed yesterday, and it&rsquo;s everything you&rsquo;d want in a second issue. The book doesn&rsquo;t waste any time spinning its wheels, instead launching forward into Dennis&rsquo;s plan to take his life back. Meanwhile, the Dennisgänger begins to assert himself in dynamic ways at Dennis&rsquo;s job. The two are hurtling toward each other, and it&rsquo;s a real pleasure to know that the storytellers aren&rsquo;t going to waste their readers&rsquo; time in the telling of the tale.</p>

<p><em>Doppelgänger</em> is fantastic, pulpy fun — a dark fantasy thriller that seems to be hurtling toward a conclusive ending. I&rsquo;d be thrilled to buy it at three times the price. At a buck fifty an issue, I&rsquo;m not sure why it&rsquo;s not on the bestseller charts.</p>
