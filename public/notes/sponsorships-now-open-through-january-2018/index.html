<p><p class="noindent">We&rsquo;ve just released <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">sponsorship dates through January 2018</a>. They&rsquo;re going fast, but there&rsquo;s still plenty of time to <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">grab a slot</a>.</p> Got a breakthrough book to promote, an amazing event, or a class or retreat that Seattle&rsquo;s active community of readers and writers should know about? We&rsquo;d love to help you get the word out.</p>

<p>Our sponsors get an exclusive presence, appearing on every page of the site for a full week, with a special mention on the home page and in our social media feeds at start and finish. Our favorite bit: the chance to hook readers by offering a sneak peek at a chapter or more. Check out this week&rsquo;s special feature &mdash; <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">a young author&rsquo;s harrowing journey</a> &mdash; to see what it looks like.</p>

<p>Sponsorship costs $150 for a full week of promotion to our engaged and passionate readers. And it supports all of the great writing you see on the site, from our <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/06/15/future-alternative-past-deadish/">weekly columns</a> to our <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/01/03/revenge/">Poet of the Month</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/">Sign up now</a> to get your preferred dates, or <a href="mailto:sponsorships@seattlereviewofbooks.com">email us</a> with questions.</p>
