<p style="font-size:16px;font-family:SeravekLightItalic">_forget your perfect offering<br>
just ring the bells that still can ring<br>
there is a crack in everything<br> 
that’s how the light gets in_<br>
- Leonard Cohen</p>

<p style="text-align:right;">_there is a crack in everything_</p>

<p class="prose-poem">my professor shows us kintsukuroi tea cups on the projector the Japanese to English translation means<br>
“golden repair”<br>
she says<br>
traditionally, the same tea cups are used in ceremonies for generations, their cracks filled in with gold.<br>
it’s the damage that makes them beautiful</p>

<p style="text-align:right;">_that’s how the light gets in_</p>

<p class="prose-poem">i am glass half empty<br>
my heart is the size of my fist too often i give myself beatings<br>
potential<br> 
leaking through cracks i make</p>

<p class="prose-poem">i say, “my idealized self would have fixed these by now” wouldn’t have made cracks in the first place<br> 
her, some kind of invincible spiritual plumber<br> 
heals as a pastime &amp; is never late<br> 
her confidence doesn’t have an asterix at the end all her cracks<br> 
are endearing<br> 
and forgivable</p>

<p class="prose-poem">she gets a red ribbon cutting when they’re fixed within a<br> 
two day weekend.<br> 
meanwhile, no one throws a ceremony when i manage to get out of bed</p>

<p class="prose-poem">do cracks even deserve gold when they take this long to fix?<br> 
i imagine liquid motivation spilling on bedroom floor, bus seat, hallways<br> 
all the countless hours wasted trying to find the newest, quickest method of being alone</p>

<p class="prose-poem">when my wounds heal and shut into thicker skin i dig into my heart’s topsoil<br> 
&mdash; cracked &amp; barren &mdash;<br> 
for feeling<br> 
try to rip this numbness out like a bad root<br> 
try to hold onto<br> 
feeling<br> 
like scarce nuggets of gold never seem to be worth enough</p>

<p class="prose-poem">so i let my wounds be tender, golden &amp; feeling instead<br> 
it’s own type of healing instead</p>

<p class="prose-poem">my mother writes<br> 
“if light could speak,<br> 
It would say your name”</p>

<p style="text-align:right;">_forget your perfect offering_</p>

<p class="prose-poem">the Latin to English translation of the word<br>
_patience_<br> 
means “quality of suffering”</p>

<p class="prose-poem">there will never be a time when i’m untouched by hardship<br> 
this world don’t have much patience for self care that interrupts the work week yet here i am<br> 
reclaiming my time<br> 
forgiving myself for all i’ve let slip<br> 
I stop missing my idealized self because i will never meet her<br>
i call recovery<br> 
“healing” instead<br> 
because i know how it feels in my hands</p>

<p class="prose-poem">because i don’t look for it in a mirror<br> 
just trust how it beats in my chest,<br> 
never as fast as i want,<br> 
but patiently doing the work nonetheless</p>

<p style="text-align:right;">_just ring the bells that still can ring_</p>

<p class="prose-poem">i throw a small ceremony when i get out of bed<br> 
I decide, that’s its own kind of beautiful ritual of patience<br>
the kind able to be used for centuries</p>
