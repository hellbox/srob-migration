<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Radical Bookselling_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moesbooks/radicalbookselling?ref=category_popular). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Doris Jo Moskowitz](http://moesbooks.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>Help Moe's Books publish this colorful volume about Moe Moskowitz, his epic bookstore, and his place in Berkeley's history.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
If you've read our site at all, you know how much we love booksellers. I may not, like Paul, have worked in bookstores, but I sure did spend a significant amount of my life in them. My family would visit bookstores like some might visit a mall. We'd all get lost for a few hours and only meet at the counter to ring up the day's haul.
</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say, however, I ever had the pleasure of going to Moe&rsquo;s. Opened in 1959, it&rsquo;s one of those local bastions that is both iconic and seems endless. At Moe&rsquo;s, they have midnight parties for new Thomas Pynchon novels. When Moe was called a &ldquo;balding intellecutal&rdquo; in the early 60s, he started the Society for the Defense of Balding Intellectuals.</p>

<p>And of course, they sell books. Now run by his daughter, the fifty-seven year old shop is still thriving. And now they&rsquo;re publishing a book about Moe.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">Because you have gotten to know your booksellers. Because we all know a person who runs a business who is incredibly quirky and brusk and interesting. In this day of homogonized corporate brands that are perectly clever or cute, how can you not want to support someone with a little more verve and personality? Small businesses can do that. Especially if you've hung your name in big letters out front.</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">They're 34% funded currently, towards their goal of $5,000. That's nothing! It's looking good!</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
