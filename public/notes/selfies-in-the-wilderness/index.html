<p>It wasn’t that she wanted to be pretty.<br>
She wanted the world to see her<br>
as she saw herself.</p>

<p>She wanted to see herself.</p>

<p>That’s what my daughter tells me.</p>

<p>I watch her, high up on these rocks,<br>
her arm extended in a welcoming gesture &mdash;<br>
she invites the world in.</p>

<p>I hold my phone arm up<br>
an echo of her greeting</p>

<p>and am horrified to see my face &mdash;<br>
some jackass left the camera flipped<br>
to stare back at the operator</p>

<p>and now I am confronted<br>
with my judgmental chins<br>
and slack mouth. What</p>

<p>was I thinking about to make<br>
such a grim expression?</p>

<p>I wanted to justify her figure<br>
in this landscape. I wanted her<br>
safe. My calcifying ideas</p>

<p>clamp around her, like the tower<br>
Rapunzel’s furious witch-mother<br>
locked her in. This fortress</p>

<p>I built with my own brain bowl,<br>
bars grown from bone, I have stuck her<br>
inside a snow dome, little white slips</p>

<p>flutter, so pretty; all the pages of magazines<br>
telling girls how to be and the flicker<br>
of grades and other ratings, ticker-tape</p>

<p>of male gaze and every comment<br>
about her body &mdash; how tall, how blue, how boobs<br>
and butt, how short the skirt &mdash;</p>

<p>why all this feedback about her appearance?<br>
Who asked you?<br>
And why mock her</p>

<p>when she draws her own door<br>
and walks through it?</p>
