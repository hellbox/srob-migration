Through tomorrow you can read an excerpt from Eugene M. Babb's stories of the gigging life, _Grit and Roses_. Babb and <a href="http://thirdplacepress.com" title="Third Place Press | Home | Print on demand and self publishing services">Third Place Press</a> are our sponsors this week, and we're absolutely thrilled to have them. 

We really loved Babb's direct, lyrical prose, and think you will too. We have <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">two pieces from the book on the sponsor page</a> for you to read. Make sure to do so before Sunday!
