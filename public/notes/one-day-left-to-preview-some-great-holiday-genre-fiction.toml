Our sponsor Grey Sun Press has put out this wonderful collection, _Joy to the Worlds: Mysterious Speculative Fiction for the Holidays_. [On our sponsor page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships "The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships"), we have samples from four of the eight stories in the book. All from fanastic local writers: Maia Chance, Janine A. Southard, Raven Oak, and G. Clemens. 

They're going on a huge tour to celebrate this, starting with a house party on December 4th. And, if you're a Santa Bot stuck on a webpage somewhere, they'll be doing a Google+ event on December 5th, a Reddit AMA on December 18th, and in between, in the real world, you'll have a chance to see the group in Bellevue [(12/6), Beaverton (12/11), Seattle (12/12), or Tacoma (12/13). Check out the page for more details](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships "The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships"). 

And our thanks to Grey Sun Press. It's amazing sponsors like this that make our site possible. We have one slot left in January &mdash; if you'd like to get your work in front of our readers, and join us to make [internet advertising 100 percent less terrible](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/ "The Seattle Review of Books - Help us make internet advertisements 100 percent less terrible"), then check out [our how to sponsor page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/ "The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books").
