<p>I first heard of <em>Vice</em> magazine while <a href="https://medium.com/@paulconstant/books-without-borders-b8ccb08b5b8a#.m31okopsy">working at Borders</a>. An achingly hip young man came into the store — it was the late nineties and my memory is foggy, but he was probably dressed like a rave had collided with a grunge music festival — and asked me if we carried <em>Vice</em>. I said I didn&rsquo;t know what <em>Vice</em> was. He explained that it was a cool free magazine distributed around major American cities, and that new issues disappeared as quickly as they arrived. Without really thinking, I asked why, if it was such a cool magazine, he went looking for it in a corporate chain bookstore. The bluntness of the question didn&rsquo;t really strike me until it had already left my mouth, and we stared at each other awkwardly for a second before he left the store.</p>

<p>For the last decade, <em>Vice</em> has been trying to become an international media brand, to varying levels of success. Their website certainly gets a lot of clicks — though, honestly, all sorts of garbage news sites get a lot of clicks simply because they&rsquo;re on good terms with Facebook. But we&rsquo;re now seeing that <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/viceland-low-ratings-shane-smith-ae-disney-vice-media/"><em>Vice</em>&rsquo;s new TV channel, which was supposed to bring &ldquo;millennials back to TV,&rdquo; is failing miserably</a>.</p>

<blockquote>...Viceland is only drawing an average primetime audience of 45,000 in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen data obtained by the *Wall Street Journal*. Worse, the median viewer age is 40, meaning that fully half of its total audience is far outside the “millennial” audience, widely considered to be 18-34.</blockquote>

<p><em>Vice</em>&rsquo;s quest for mass-media success confuses the hell out of me. The whole point of <em>Vice</em> has always been exclusivity: from the beginning, it&rsquo;s been targeted to a mostly male, mostly white audience of terrible people who live in cool neighborhoods. (Please note that <em>Vice</em> has often published the work of very good writers and very good cartoonists; I&rsquo;m not saying everything in <em>Vice</em> has always been awful and I&rsquo;m not saying that everyone who&rsquo;s read <em>Vice</em> is a terrible person. I&rsquo;m referring, here, to the institutional strategy behind <em>Vice</em>.)</p>

<p>It is not a publication that has ever been intended for everyone. It&rsquo;s a publication for people — again, mostly white, mostly male, mostly affluent — who desperately care about how cool they are. Thankfully, that&rsquo;s always going to be a slender slice of the population. For <em>Vice</em> to gain traction with a wider slice of the market, a <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/disney-and-vice-a-storybook-romance-1471963909">Disney-sized portion of the market</a>, say, it&rsquo;s going to have to radically change its model, and once it changes its model, it won&rsquo;t be <em>Vice</em> anymore. It&rsquo;ll be CNN for Assholes.</p>

<p>And frankly, there&rsquo;s already a CNN for Assholes and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/15/gavin-mcinnes-women-happier-at-home_n_7289048.html">one of <em>Vice</em>&rsquo;s founding members already works there</a>. Does the world really need a Fox News: Coachella Edition? The fact is, <em>Vice</em>&rsquo;s brand of &ldquo;edgy&rdquo; hipster racism and &ldquo;just-playing&rdquo; sexism is outdated, and its anti-mass-market edge is a corporate pose. It&rsquo;s aging. It&rsquo;s not millennial, it belongs to those asshole white dudes who were in their twenties when <em>Vice</em> was ascendent. It&rsquo;s middle-aged now, and the company is flexing its sagging muscles just as hard as a 50-year-old middle manager who buys a shiny new sports car.</p>

<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s biologically impossible for me to write about <em>Vice</em> without posting this video of sainted <em>New  York Times</em> reporter David Carr tearing <em>Vice</em>&rsquo;s current CEO, Shane Smith,  to shreds in the middle of an interview:</p>
