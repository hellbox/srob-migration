<p>I work at University Book Store, but I’d been away for a few years and I just came back, so I didn’t see these in hardcover. I am a super-fan of Roman history and I’m really incredibly excited to get one or both of these as gifts. <em>SPQR</em> has been doing gangbusters — we had her for an event; I’m so sad I didn’t get to go, but I was working.  I really can&rsquo;t wait to read some new [laughs] — “*new*” — Roman history.</p>
