<p>So billionaire Paul Allen has funded a very large and very successful art fair in Seattle. <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/music/paul-allens-new-festival-upstream-to-mentor-and-celebrate-seattle-musicians/">Nicole Brodeur at the <em>Seattle Times</em> just broke the news</a> that next year, Allen is funding a very large music festival in Seattle.</p>

<p>So, uh, <strong>when is Paul Allen going to get around to funding a very large book festival in Seattle</strong>? Compared to those other two festivals, this one will be a bargain to put on. Hell, I bet if Allen committed a quarter of the cost of his music festival to books, it would be one of the biggest, best literary festivals in the world â€” the kind of literary festival that Seattle deserves.</p>
