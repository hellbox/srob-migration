<li><p>Just a reminder that we are very excited about <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/26/the-seattle-review-of-books-is-coming-to-bumbershoot/">the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> showcase happening at Bumbershoot this Sunday at 7:30 pm</a>. We&rsquo;ll be presenting poets EJ Koh and Robert Lashley onstage with poet, novelist, short story author, and all-around Seattle literary lion Sherman Alexie. We hope to see you there.</p></li>

<li><p>Wallingford&rsquo;s wonderful Open Books <a href="http://www.openpoetrybooks.com/">closed yesterday and will remain closed for about two weeks</a> because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;transition time,&rdquo; which means  old owner <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/04/open-books-owner-john-marshall-is-in-the-closing-stages-of-selling-the-shop-to-a-new-owner/">John Marshall</a> will be officially handing over ownership to <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/27/introducing-billie-swift-the-new-owner-of-open-books/">Billie Swift</a>. Expect the store to reopen in mid-September under Swift&rsquo;s command.</p></li>

<li><p>You have two days to <a href="https://tahomaliteraryreview.com/2016/08/30/last-two-days-to-submit-for-our-8th-issue/">submit to the <em>Tahoma Literary Review</em>&rsquo;s eighth issue</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>So happy that Ursula Le Guin is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/books/ursula-le-guin-has-earned-a-rare-honor-just-dont-call-her-a-sci-fi-writer.html?_r=0">getting her own Library of America edition</a> but it&rsquo;s a little sad that she prickles so much at the mention of genre: &ldquo;&lsquo;I don’t want to be reduced to being &ldquo;the sci-fi writer.&rdquo; People are always trying to push me off the literary scene, and to hell with it,&rsquo;&rdquo; she tells the <em>New York Times</em>. This is very likely a generational thing — Vonnegut hated being referred to as a sci-fi writer, too — and in the long run, it&rsquo;s not a big deal. Still, it&rsquo;s a shame that Le Guin can&rsquo;t take pleasure in raising the bar for an entire genre.</p></li>

<li><p>Amazon&rsquo;s newest brick-and-mortar Amazon Books store <a href="http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/amazon-to-open-a-bookstore-in-chicago/124275">will open in Chicago in 2017</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Since <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/can-you-just-not/">the internet is currently (and rightly) aghast</a> at a dumb blog&rsquo;s &ldquo;how to talk to a woman wearing headphones&rdquo; article, let&rsquo;s just take this opportunity to remind men how to talk to women reading books in public. Step one: <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong>. Every step after that: <strong>seriously, don&rsquo;t</strong>. This has been a public service announcement from the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>.</p></li>
