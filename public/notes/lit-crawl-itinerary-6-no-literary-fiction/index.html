<p class="intro">On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our sixth suggested itinerary:</p>

<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re not in the mood for another short story about a man and a woman hurtling toward a divorce. Short, spare sentences about alcoholics won&rsquo;t do it for you. Here&rsquo;s the perfect itinerary for those of you who are burned out on Raymond Carver wannabes:</p>

<p><strong>1</strong>. Your night starts out at The Cloud Room with a reading titled &ldquo;Consider the Oyster: A Puget Sound Love Story.&ldquo;Food writers Langdon Cook and Sara Dickerman will read non-fiction about oysters, which press materials erroneously refer to as Seattle&rsquo;s &ldquo;favorite bivalve&rdquo; (uh, geoduck, anyone?) and Walrus &amp; the Carpenter owner Renee Erickson will take audience questions.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>. Adaâ€™s Technical Books hosts an indie comics reading/presentation with local cartoonists Natalie Dupille, Eroyn Franklin, Mita Mahato, and Gina Siciliano. This is a good warmup for the <a href="http://www.shortrun.org/">Short Run Comix &amp; Arts Festival</a>, which happens on Halloween at Seattle Center.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>. At the Pine Box, Darren Davis, Rachel Springer, James Gapinski, and Frances Dinger will read non-fiction, poetry, and fiction centering around video games.</p>
