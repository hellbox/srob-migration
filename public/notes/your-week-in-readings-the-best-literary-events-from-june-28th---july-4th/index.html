<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Saturday July 1st: <em>The Fateful Fourth</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Washington historian Russel Holter discusses “the notorious 1900 trolley accident” that helped shape the city of Tacoma for a whole century. It’s an account of a doomed 4th of July celebration that, on our first 4th of July under President Trump, might be even more resonant than ever.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Sunday July 2nd: Reading with Rover</strong></h5></p>
Fun fact: if you know a child who is having trouble learning how to read, have them practice reading to dogs. And if you don’t have any dogs in your life, bring them to this event, which features trained therapy dogs just waiting for kids to read to them.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Monday July 3rd: Works in Progress</strong></h5></p>
One of Seattle’s most venerable open mic nights continues in a special pre-Independence Day edition.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Tuesday July 4th: Democracy Slam</strong></h5></p>
What better way to celebrate the 4th of July than with a poetry slam? Think of today’s Democracy Slam as a celebration of your constitutional right to celebrate the freedom of speech, with booze and prizes. It’s a hell of a lot more fun than getting drunk and blowing a thumb off with some fireworks.
