<li><p>Samantha Pak at the Seattle Globalist has written <a href="http://www.seattleglobalist.com/2016/06/27/seattle-bookstores-tackle-literatures-lack-of-diversity/52964">a great report on diversity in Seattle&rsquo;s bookstore scene</a>. It&rsquo;s a must-read.</p></li>

<li><p>Seattle cartoonist Seth Goodkind discovered that someone plagiarized his artwork in order to win a contest put on by a music festival. When confronted, the artist apologized, but Goodkind wrote a wonderful letter explaining why plagiarism and contests for &ldquo;exposure&rdquo; harm artists. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sethbeastmeat/posts/696452340495554">publicly posted on his Facebook wall</a> and it&rsquo;s worth your time to read the whole thing. A taste:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Try asking several car dealerships if they will let you drive their vehicles around for a couple of weeks, and, if you like one, you might pay them for the mileage, and in the meantime, it’ll be “great exposure.” Considered this way, spec-work is simply a way of taking an artists work for little or nothing. In essence, theft.</blockquote>

<li><p>I recently interviewed the author Mary Roach about <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/rational-exuberance/">her wonderful book <em>Grunt</em></a> at Town Hall Seattle. If you couldn&rsquo;t attend, the audio of that interview is now <a href="http://kuow.org/post/mary-roach-curious-tales-extraordinary-science-war">available over at KUOW</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;It is nearly impossible to be a writer and not be complicit in white supremacy,&rdquo; writes Zinzi Clemmons in an essay titled &ldquo;<a href="http://lithub.com/what-it-means-to-be-an-inclusive-literary-journal/">What It Means to Be an Inclusive Literary Journal</a>&rdquo; published at Literary Hub.</p></li>
