<p>Did you know that Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, is a real dillhole? It&rsquo;s true! And the Tumblr <a href="http://mradilbert.tumblr.com/?og=1">MRA Dilbert</a> performs a real public service by publishing Scott Adams&rsquo;s actual words in the word balloons of his characters. This is such a clever way to comment on Adams&rsquo; toxic beliefs. Contrasting them with the bland inoccuousness of his cartoons — although calling Adams&rsquo;s drawing &ldquo;cartoons&rdquo; feels like an insult to cartooning — lays all the ugliness of his ideas and work out for anyone to see.</p>
