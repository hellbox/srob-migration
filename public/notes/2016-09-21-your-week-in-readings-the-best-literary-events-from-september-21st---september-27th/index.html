Yale professor Akhil Reed Amar is one of our leading Constitutional scholars—he even advised writers on <em>The West Wing</em> on Constitutional law.

<p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Sunday September 25th: <em>LOSER: The Real Seattle Music Story</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Once upon a time, young people were flocking to Seattle to take part in its music scene.

A decade ago, Jonathan Safran Foer came to Seattle for a triumphant reading to celebrate his second novel, <em>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</em>. Tonight he returns with his third novel, and reviews have been…less than kind. (There’s a scene where a husband makes his wife orgasm by staring at her vagina.) It’s time for some good old-fashioned literary rubbernecking.
