<p>We just got maybe the most welcome press release in the history of press releases. It begins, &ldquo;<strong>The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) announced it designated Seattle as a City of Literature in the Creative Cities Network</strong>.&rdquo; As a City of Literature, Seattle joins more than 20 other cities around the world in the network, including Baghdad, Dublin, Reykjavík, Prague, and Montevideo.</p>

<p>This is the culmination of a <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/we-can-do-this/Content?oid=17329575">years-long process</a>; the bid for Seattle as a City of Literature began in 2013 and it has seen wholesale staffing changes, survived four different mayors, and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/10/12/trump-administration-withdraws-from-unesco-effectively-stalling-seattles-bid-to-become-a-unesco-city-of-literature/">the US&rsquo;s withdrawal from UNESCO</a> in the intervening years. (I wrote earlier this month that this last development &ldquo;effectively stall[ed]&rdquo; our bid; I&rsquo;ve rarely been more relieved to be wrong.)</p>

<p>Through the whole process, <a href="http://seattlecityoflit.org/">Seattle City of Literature</a> has been promoting the bid. I just got off the phone with City of Literature Board President Bob Redmond to discuss UNESCO&rsquo;s announcement. Redmond, who just learned that the bid was successful &ldquo;about an hour ago,&rdquo; sounds like he&rsquo;s still processing the news.</p>

<p>Why should Seattleites care that we&rsquo;re now a UNESCO-recognized City of Literature? What does this mean for the city? “We all know that Seattle is a world-class city,&rdquo; Redmond explains, &ldquo;but this underlines it in a new way — especially for people who care about the arts, or books, or words. It matters to everybody here that the world is looking at Seattle as a cultural leader. That should make us feel good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How does Redmond feel about this? &ldquo;I feel a mixture of justification and joy,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I feel justification because I don’t think that the mission of UNESCO and this organization could be more relevant than it is right now: to build understanding through the literary arts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the world of 2017, Redmond says, &ldquo;we can see how fraught and disturbing things can get when the battle lines are drawn. I have a great faith in the arts as the way that people can imagine something different.&rdquo; He says the designation is &ldquo;just extremely timely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then I feel happy,&rdquo; Redmond says, &ldquo;because so many people have put hundreds of hours of effort into this over the years that it feels really earned. Finally, I’d say Seattle is such a deserving city.&rdquo; He says our tradition of literature extends &ldquo;all the way back to the oral traditions of the indigenous peoples here,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to be recognized for this is a tremendous honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s next for Seattle now that we&rsquo;re officially a City of Literature? &ldquo;We just <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/10/20/last-nights-lit-crawl-was-worth-braving-the-traffic-apocalypse/">wrapped up our Indigenous Writers Exchange</a>&rdquo; at Lit Crawl this year, Redmond says, &ldquo;and what’s next is our programs for 2018. Also, we have to do a lot of communicating with all the other cities in the network and catch up with the lay of the land in the Creative Cities Network.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is where the real joyous work begins. Seattle is now officially a member of a continuum of international cities, and we will be invited to participate in cultural exchange programs with other cities in the network. I expect to see collaboration with other UNESCO cities begin in earnest very soon.</p>

<p>So what can readers of the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> do to help? Redmond explains, &ldquo;we are looking for additional board members&rdquo; of the Seattle City of Literature organization. The current board, he says, &ldquo;was put together to get to this point and we are looking for the next group of leaders to lead the organization&rdquo; onto the international stage. (Interested parties can contact Seattle City of Literature <a href="http://seattlecityoflit.org/">through their website</a>.) The city of Seattle has officially, finally, been recognized as a leader in world literature. Now it&rsquo;s time to show the world why we deserve the designation.</p>
