We just heard from [Seattle7Writers](http://www.seattle7writers.org), and they're sorry to report the Bookish Brunch had to be cancelled. 

<blockquote class="noline">Due to unforeseen circumstances, the Bookish Brunch is cancelled. Thank you for your support of Seattle7Writers; we look forward to seeing you at another event soon!</blockquote>

Big thanks to Seattle7Writers for their sponsorship this week. Be sure to keep in touch with them, maybe [pop your name onto their mailing list](http://www.seattle7writers.org/contact.html), so you know when the next event is coming up.
