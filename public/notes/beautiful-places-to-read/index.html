<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear that <a href="http://weburbanist.com/2015/09/02/room-to-read-in-a-digital-world-14-modern-library-designs/">this post at Web Urbanist</a> is a multi-page list, which is a genre of blog post that usually deserves nothing but scorn. But I&rsquo;ll have to give it a pass, because it&rsquo;s about 14 modern library designs and it&rsquo;s the most beautiful thing I&rsquo;ve seen on the internet this week. Every single one of these spaces looks like a wonderful place to read; I especially love the Prague National Library, which looks like a giant cartoon amoeba.</p>
