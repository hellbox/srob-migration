<p>We have already recommended the Literary Mixer at the Hideout as <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/26/your-week-in-readings-the-best-events-from-october-26th-to-november-1st/">tonight&rsquo;s must-attend book event</a>, and for good reason: I&rsquo;ve attended this event on multiple occasions and it&rsquo;s always a lot of fun. But we&rsquo;re always happy to hear a second opinion, especially when it comes from a trusted source, like <em>SRoB</em> reader Aaron Brethorst, <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronbrethorst/status/658507335627771905">who writes in on Twitter</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/paulconstant">@paulconstant</a> another literary event of some note for this week: <a href="https://t.co/HUMEQKdQX4">https://t.co/HUMEQKdQX4</a>&#10;&#10;Here’s some coverage : <a href="https://t.co/wZlVQsfAYo">https://t.co/wZlVQsfAYo</a></p>&mdash; Aaron Brethorst (@aaronbrethorst) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronbrethorst/status/658507335627771905">October 26, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>The event Brethorst is linking to is an appearance by the debut novelist <a href="http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=10&amp;evyear=2015&amp;eventid=2015071312233500&amp;pre=20151017&amp;pst=20151031">Sigal Samuel</a>, who will be reading from her novel <em>The Mystics of Mile End</em> at University Book Store. The <a href="http://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/books/new-voices-of-fiction-freehand-books-launches-debut-works-from-rhonda-douglas-sigal-samuel">interview with the <em>Calgary Herald</em></a> makes <em>Mile End</em> sound fascinating — a family story, a study of religion, a multi-perspective narrative.</p>

<p>The fact is, any given night in Seattle will provide an overwhelming assortment of incredible literary events. We can&rsquo;t recommend them all. But we do love hearing from our readers — on Twitter, on Facebook, through email — and we take their recommendations seriously. If you&rsquo;re not feeling social enough for the Literary Mixer event tonight, you should absolutely make your way to University Book Store. Thanks, Aaron, for the tip!</p>
