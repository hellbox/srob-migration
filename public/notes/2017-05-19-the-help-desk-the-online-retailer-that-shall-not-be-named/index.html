<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>I work at a large independent bookstore. I love my job, but my manager is getting on my nerves — specifically, his tendency to smack-talk Amazon to customers. He’s always launching into lectures about why shopping at Amazon is a bad idea, how they don’t support the community, and stuff like that.</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>I agree with him! Amazon is bad. But he brings up Amazon a lot. Like, a lot. I know he thinks he’s educating customers, but he sounds like a scold, and kind of a bore.</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>I’m pretty new at bookselling, but it seems to me that people aren’t going to shop at indies out of guilt. They’re going to do it because they like indies better. And if we lecture them all the time about the “Evil Empire” or whatever, that’s just going to scare them away.</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>But I’m not really comfortable with lecturing my manager about lecturing customers. Can you think of a way to help me realize that he’s being counterproductive?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Lily, Alki</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Lily,</p>

<p class="noindent">You're right – people don't shop at indie bookstores for bitter lectures from staff on what their competitors are doing. You know this, your customers know this, your boss apparently does not. </p>

<p>But I empathize with your boss&rsquo;s Ahab-esque obsession. One of my favorite northwest pastimes used to be lecturing conservative hunters about how safe access to abortion is a fundamental human right. I firmly believed that everyone would agree with me if they just first gave me three hours of their undivided attention, preferably somewhere festively claustrophobic, like the bathroom hallway at a house party.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to fall into the habit of such selfish soapbox lectures. Everyone loves agreeing with themselves and in these instances your audience is held resentfully captive because they want to buy a book from you or still hold out a vague hope that eventually you&rsquo;ll grow tired of talking and fuck them, and then spend endless mornings making them elk-steak breakfasts until the race wars begin, at which point they might have to hunt you for sport because your name sounds suspiciously ethnic.</p>

<p>I was lecturing one such hunter about abortion and he interrupted me with, &ldquo;You want to kill babies, get out there and sterilize all those wild horses ruining our public lands. That&rsquo;s the kind of killing I can get behind.&rdquo; And I thought to myself, &ldquo;This man is an unfuckable genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What do northwest rural conservatives dislike more than abortion? Wild horses and wolves. Which is why, just this week I trademarked the names &ldquo;PlannedParenthoof&rdquo; and &ldquo;PlannedParentwoof&rdquo; and began the process of marketing myself as the northwest&rsquo;s first wild horse and wolf abortionist.</p>

<p>But back to your issue: obviously, your situation is complicated by the power dynamic between yourself and your manager. If your manager is a mostly reasonable person, try approaching him the next time you hear him mention Amazon to a customer and either start screaming something simple like, &ldquo;ABORT! ABORT! ABORT!&rdquo; or &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d make more headway with our customers if we thanked them and praised them for shopping with us and left our competitors out of the conversation.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re uncomfortable with this upfront tactic, you can talk to your manager&rsquo;s boss or write an letter from a &ldquo;customer&rdquo; that delicately highlights your manager&rsquo;s Amazon obsession.</p>

<p>To be clear: your boss is not likely to get over his obsession. The key is to find a way to redirect his dour lectures into positive, productive interactions with customers, much like PlannedParenthoof/woof will undoubtedly do for anti-abortionists living in rural communities.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
