<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_A Permanent Home for Kurt Vonnegut’s Legacy_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1949966329/a-permanent-home-for-kurt-vonneguts-legacy?ref=tag). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library](http://www.vonnegutlibrary.org/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>Help preserve Kurt Vonnegut’s legacy by securing a new, permanent home for the Kurt Vonnegut Museum * Library in Indianapolis, IN.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	We here at the _SRoB_ are fans of Vonnegut. So was Julia A. Whitehead, but unlike us, she founded a library in the man's name: the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library in Indianapolis. Besides holding artifacts and memorabilia from the man himself, as well as exhibits, the Library does outreach into the community, holds events, and even runs an annual literary journal.
</p>

Now they're trying to move to a larger location in Indianapolis, and are raising money to secure the new location. 

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">

Maybe you're a Vonnegut fan, like us. Maybe you've got a connection to Indianapolis, or would just like to visit someday. Maybe you like the idea of memorial library like this that does outreach and acts as a cultural institution to carry on the works of a single writer. 
</p>

If that describes you, now would be the time to get in. 

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	They're 39% funded with 19 days to go. It'll be a long slog to $100,000. Every little bit will help!
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
