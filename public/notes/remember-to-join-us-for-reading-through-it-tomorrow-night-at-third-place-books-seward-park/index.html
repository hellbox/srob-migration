<p>Just a quick note to remind you that <a href="http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/reading-through-it-book-club-man-without-face-unlikely-rise-vladimir-putin">tomorrow night at 7 p.m., we&rsquo;ll be at Third Place Books Seward Park to discuss Masha Gessen&rsquo;s <em>The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin</em></a>. Reading this book at this particular time in history has been especially weird: without mentioning Trump at all, the book has been incredibly informative about current events.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;d urge you to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ezra-klein-show/masha-gessen-offers-a-plausible-trump-russia-theory">listen to today&rsquo;s episode of the <em>Ezra Klein Show</em></a>, which features a brand-new long interview with Gessen. We&rsquo;ll have so much to discuss tomorrow. I hope to see you then.</p>
