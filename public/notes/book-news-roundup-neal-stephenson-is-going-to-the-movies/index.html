<li><p>Seattle author Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s <em>Seveneves</em> will be adapted into a film by writer Bill Broyles, director Ron Howard and producer Brian Grazer — the same team that made <em>Apollo 13</em>, <a href="http://deadline.com/2016/06/seveneves-movie-ron-howard-brian-grazer-bill-broyles-apollo-13-skydance-1201769130/">Deadline reports</a>. Based on <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/sticking-the-landing/">Martin McClellan&rsquo;s review of <em>Seveneves</em></a>, they have a lot of good stuff to work with.</p></li>

<li><p>Author Kate Messner wrote a kid&rsquo;s book about addiction. Apparently, this is a controversial-enough topic that <a href="http://www.katemessner.com/a-blog-post-i-never-thought-id-be-writing-on-book-release-day/">a school cancelled Messner&rsquo;s planned visit</a>:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote> I was told today that the principal felt the book and my presentation about the writing process behind it would generate many questions that they would not be able to adequately answer and discuss. I called and asked the school to reconsider because I desperately didn’t want to disappoint all those kids. I explained how the topic was handled in a sensitive, age appropriate way.</blockquote>

<li><p>Why do people insist on using Netflix terms to describe books? First, everyone was crazy about &ldquo;<a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/netflix-books-startup-oyster-shutting/">The Netflix of Books</a>,&rdquo; which turned out to be a dumb idea because libraries already exist. Now the <em>Wired</em> headline &ldquo;<a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/06/fsg-serialized-book-publishing/">You May Soon Binge Books Just Like You Binge Netflix</a>&rdquo; is making my eyelid twitch. We already binge books. It&rsquo;s called reading. And when we read a novel, we&rsquo;re already absorbing the equivalent of a TV season or two. Watching movies is one thing, reading books is another. I understand that it&rsquo;s helpful to use metaphors to explain concepts to people, but these Netflix-to-books false equivalencies are particularly clumsy.</p></li>
