<p>So it turns out that Simon &amp; Schuster&rsquo;s &ldquo;free speech&rdquo; defense of Yiannopoulos was total bullshit. When people complained about Yiannopoulos&rsquo;s racism and sexim, Simon &amp; Schuster was high on the free speech horse. But now that video has emerged of Yiannopoulos exercising his free speech about pedophilia, Simon &amp; Schuster runs away.</p>

<p>In other words, it was only when Yiannopoulos started spouting <strong>unmarketable speech</strong> that Simon &amp; Schuster got queasy. <strong>This was never about free speech. This was always about money.</strong></p>
