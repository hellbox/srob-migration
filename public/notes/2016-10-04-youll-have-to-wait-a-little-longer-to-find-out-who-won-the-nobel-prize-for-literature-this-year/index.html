        <p>This year&rsquo;s Nobel Prize for literature will be announced on October 13th, which is later than usual for weird calendar reasons. <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20160930/nobel-literature-prize-announcement-pushed-back">This piece at The Local</a> says the betting markets think Haruki Murakami is a favorite to win the prize this year. Since Philip Roth retired, Haruki Murakami has always topped the betting markets, and — spoiler alert — he has never won the Nobel Prize. (Neither has Roth, for that matter, and he was the favorite for at least a decade before Murakami took over the position.) Betting markets are notoriously bad for this sort of thing. Some financial advice from the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>: <strong>do not bet on arts awards for financial gain</strong>. You will likely lose your shirt. Just wait until the 13th to find out who wins with the rest of us.</p>
