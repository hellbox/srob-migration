<p>Those special snowflakes in the so-called &ldquo;men&rsquo;s rights movement&rdquo; have targeted Australian bookstore <a href="http://avidreader.com.au/events">Avid Reader Bookshop</a> for sharing a post by feminist writer Clementine Ford.

Unfortunately, this seems like it might become a semi-regular occurence.</p>
