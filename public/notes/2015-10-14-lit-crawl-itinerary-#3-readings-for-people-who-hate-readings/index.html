        <p class="intro">On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our third suggested itinerary:</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re sick and tired of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; readings, where someone stands up and talks about their book for fifteen minutes, Lit Crawl&rsquo;s got you covered.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong>. At Capitol Cider, Seattle Public Library librarians David Wright and Andrea Gough will present a cider flight, along with readings to go with each of the ciders. Gough and Wright are wonderful readers, and they&rsquo;re likely to uncover some real gems for this event. Plus, drinking with librarians is always a lot of fun.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>. At the Frye Art Museum, Rachel Kessler will present a slideshow performance of <em>Christian Charm Workbook</em>,  &ldquo;her multimedia memoir about growing up with the Jesus movement in 1970s Seattle.&rdquo; Kessler is a great local writer, and she always finds some interesting ways to incorporate other media and performance into her work.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>. It&rsquo;s back to Capitol Cider for you, where Book-It Repertory Theater will perform a segment of their adaptation of David James Duncan&rsquo;s brilliant novel <em>Brothers K</em>, which is a retelling of <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> set in Washington state.</p>
