<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday May 26: *White Sands* Reading
**</h5></p>
Geoff Dyer writes nimbly about difficult concepts that are exceptionally difficult for most writers to explain; he once wrote a book about not writing a book about D.H. Lawrence. *White Sands* is about travel, and the idea of travel, and living in the world; I can’t explain it, but I know Dyer can. *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Friday May 26: <em>Paper: Paging Through History</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
In both <em>Cod</em> and <em>Salt</em>, Mark Kurlansky wrote huge, well-researched books about seemingly tiny topics which expand into nuanced histories of the entire world. His newest, Paper, promises to do the same trick with paper and the written word, though it also looks forward, at the prospect (threat?) of a paperless future. *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, <a href="http://townhallseattle.org">http://townhallseattle.org</a>. $5.

Now that we’re a world-class city with our very own giant Amazon balls, it’s hard to remember that Seattle used to have its own local low-budget <em>Saturday Night Live</em>.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Monday May 30: <em>Author: The JT LeRoy Story</em> Screening</strong></h5></p>
In the late 1990s, everyone was obsessed with JT LeRoy, a media-shy author who wrote thinly veiled novels about his own life as a drug-addicted homeless youth. Then, LeRoy was outed as a middle-aged woman named Laura Albert. Jeff Feuerzeig’s documentary about LeRoy/Albert is coming to SIFF, and today I’ll be joining him for a post-screening interview. *Shoreline Community College, 16101 Greenwood Ave. N., 464.5830, <a href="http://siff.net">http://siff.net</a>. $13.

Sebastian Junger is not just one of the dreamiest authors alive—he’s a hottie who fearlessly launches himself into dangerous situations—he’s also one of the most compassionate. His newest book, <em>Tribe</em>, documents the many pitfalls that befall veterans when they return to normal life in America, including suicide, PTSD, and drug <em>Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, <a href="http://townhallseattle.org">http://townhallseattle.org</a>. $5.
