<p>I don&rsquo;t think that Seattle writer and comedian Brett Hamil would be offended if I referred to his art as amateurish. He&rsquo;s not looking to wow you with his hyperrealistic portraits, or his three-dimensional rendering style. No, the illustration in his cartoons are fairly primitive; they&rsquo;re better than I (and likely you) could draw, to be sure, but not by too much.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s okay. Hamil is a standup comedian, and his cartoons are strictly joke delivery systems — the quickest way for him to get a good laugh out of you in the print medium. In that regard, they work really well; they&rsquo;re classic gag cartoons.</p>

<p>Hamil has collected some of his funniest <em>City Arts</em> cartoons in a five dollar zine titled <em>Subconscious Hairstyle Mirroring (and other notions)</em>, and I&rsquo;m pleased to report that the strips work even better in aggregate than they did singly, as they were originally published.</p>

<p>Like any good gag cartoonist, Hamil works within a few formulas. He imagines absurdist magazine covers (sample <em>Infant Magazine</em> headline: &ldquo;Object Permanence: Myth or Fact?&ldquo;) and creates little four-item lists of observational comedy (one of the items in &ldquo;Why We&rsquo;ve Got Swagger Today:&rdquo; &ldquo;Found typo in the <em>New Yorker</em>.&ldquo;)</p>

<p>These strips are full of the kind of laughs that come when you recognize the absurd in the familiar. Schlubby middle-aged white guys are absolutely crazy about boxer briefs, for instance, and introducing someone to your favorite barista is, in fact, a major relationship benchmark. When rendered in Hamil&rsquo;s no-frills style, the jokes are even funnier: there&rsquo;s a nice back-of-the-envelope feel that saves the strips from becoming too self-important.</p>

<p>Hamil claims to have assembled <em>Hairstyle</em> as a minicomic because he believes the internet, with its weird self-destructive social media and its lack of net neutrality, is going away. I&rsquo;d almost welcome internet armageddon if it meant more physical media like this.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;d definitely welcome another collection of comics that highlight Hamil&rsquo;s more strident political side. With his passionate political commentary Hamil has become one of Seattle&rsquo;s most outspoken citizens — the kind of angry truth-teller that politicians loathe and activists adore.</p>

<p><em>Hairstyle</em> generally sticks to social commentary and absurdist comedy, and that feels exactly right for a debut collection. But if Hamil published a collection of comics about Seattle&rsquo;s consistent failure to construct a strong municipal broadband system, for example, I&rsquo;d be the first in line to slap down my five bucks. When a comedian starts speaking relentless truth to power, that&rsquo;s when things really start getting good.</p>
