<p class="intro">On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our first suggested itinerary:</p>

<p>New literary magazines and publishers are popping up all the time in Seattle, and Lit Crawl is a great opportunity to sample what&rsquo;s out there. Whether you&rsquo;re an aspring author looking to network or a reader desperate for new voices, this itinerary is for you.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong>. <em>The James Franco Review</em> reading at the Capitol Hill Branch Library starts off your Lit Crawl. The <em>Review</em> is dedicated to treating every author as though they&rsquo;re worthy of the privilege and prestige that James Franco enjoys every day of his life. <em>JF Review</em> ontributors Lena Khalaf Tuffaha, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/06/korean-war/"><em>SRoB</em> contributor EJ Koh</a>, Isaiah Swango, and Leija Farr will read. Editors Corinne Manning and Aaron Counts will host.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>. Local publisher Instant Future, the e-book imprint of Portland&rsquo;s Future Tense, presents authors Zach Ellis, Litsa Dremousis, and Tara Atkinson at the Raygun Lounge. They&rsquo;ll each be reading from their novella-sized non-fiction e-books. This event is hosted by Instant Future publisher Matthew Simmons and Instant Future author <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-perpetual-naked-lunch-of-starvation-mode/">Elissa Washuta</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>. End the Crawl up at Ada&rsquo;s Technical Books, where <em>Spartan</em> editor Ross McMeekin presents contributors Ian Denning, Jenny Hayes, M.C. Easton, and Robert P. Kaye.</p>
