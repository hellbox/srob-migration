<p>Fantagraphics author Ed Piskor announced this morning <a href="https://www.facebook.com/edpiskor/posts/10206648029095454">on Facebook</a> that the rights for his wonderful comic book about the history of hip hop, <em>Hip Hop Family Tree</em>, have been sold to Hollywood. Specifically, it&rsquo;s in development as an animated series, and Piskor assures his fans that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;not one of those dime-a-dozen &lsquo;options&rsquo; you hear about,&rdquo; meaning there&rsquo;s real progress underway.</p>

<p>Is this the first time a Fantagraphics comic has ever been adapted into an animated series, or am I forgetting about a canceled attempt at a <em>Love &amp; Rockets</em> TV show? I would love to see Jim Woodring&rsquo;s <em>Frank</em> series get adapted into an HBO animated series for stoned adults; given that Woodring got his start in the Hanna Barbera animation studio, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like too much of a stretch.</p>
