<p>Sam Jordison&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/dec/13/fight-clubs-dark-fantasies-reality-chuck-palahniuk">essay in the <em>Guardian</em></a> about how <em>Fight Club</em> activated a generation of young white men and turned them into trolls, Trump fans, fascists, and Gamergaters is well worth your time:</p>

<blockquote>Rereading the novel in 2016 is chilling. Researching the book online, I found myself falling down a dark wormhole of fascistic websites that quote big chunks of David Fincher’s film adaptation as parts of their credo; even though parts are almost verbatim from the book, alt-right types tend to quote the film – because they either don’t agree with the overall message of Palahniuk’s book or they haven’t bothered to read it.</blockquote>

<p>I came across Jordison&rsquo;s essay via a Max Gladstone&rsquo;s tweet-thread, which started here:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1999, me: &quot;Fight Club is a movie about challenges facing men in 20th c&quot;<br>Dad: &quot;This movie is about how fascist movements get started.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/jwRTxOGx9V">https://t.co/jwRTxOGx9V</a></p>&mdash; Max Gladstone (@maxgladstone) <a href="https://twitter.com/maxgladstone/status/808832620465455104">December 14, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Related: I wonder if it ever occurs to the alt-right/Gamergate/MGTOW communities that their two seminal texts are <em>Fight Club</em> and the <em>Matrix</em> — in other words, a novel about toxic masculinity by a gay Portland author, and a film by diversity-loving transgender writer/directors? Does it ever occur to them that their entire ideology is based on a misreading of the surface elements of those two texts? If they were to realize this, do you think it would bother them at all?</p>
