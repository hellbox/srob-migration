<blockquote>A Wisconsin elementary school has cancelled the reading of a childrenâ€™s book about a transgender girl after parents threatened to sue claiming that the reading would be a violation of parents rights.</blockquote>

<p>The book in question is <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780803741072"><em>I Am Jazz</em>, written by Jessica Herthel and Jazz Jennings, and illustrated by Shelagh McNicholas</a>. These bigoted parents need to understand that <strong>banning a book never works</strong>; it only results in more copies sold and increased interest. A few more of these moronic attempts to ban the book from the public conversation will likely result in <em>I Am Jazz</em> landing on the bestseller list, where it belongs.</p>
