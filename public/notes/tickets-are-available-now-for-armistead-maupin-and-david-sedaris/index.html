<p>I&rsquo;m taking part in a couple of upcoming readings at Benaroya Hall that you might want to consider attending.</p>

<p>Next Monday, I&rsquo;m appearing in conversation with beloved novelist Armistead Maupin. He&rsquo;ll be in Seattle to debut his brand-new memoir, <em>Logical Family</em>, which charts Maupin&rsquo;s path from a young conservative kid growing up in the South to a beloved newspaper columnist and gay rights activist to the novelist who created the astonishing <em>Tales of the City</em> series. Maupin&rsquo;s career path is a wild one, and he&rsquo;s telling his own story for the very first time. <a href="https://cart.seattlesymphony.org/single/SYOS.aspx?p=19556">Tickets for that reading are available here</a>.</p>

<p>And then on Sunday, November 19th, I&rsquo;ll be introducing David Sedaris as he makes his annual swing through town. You probably don&rsquo;t need me to tell you that Sedaris is one of the very finest readers in the world. I&rsquo;ve attended his Seattle readings for almost twenty years now — from back when he used to fill up the downstairs reading room at Elliott Bay Book Company&rsquo;s Pioneer Square location — and I&rsquo;ve never seen him give a bad show. He&rsquo;s always funny and smart and very, very entertaining. <a href="https://cart.seattlesymphony.org/single/SYOS.aspx?p=19548">Tickets for that are available now</a>. You won&rsquo;t regret attending this reading.</p>
