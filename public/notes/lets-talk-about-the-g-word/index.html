<p>This Saturday, I&rsquo;ll be <a href="http://genius.fryemuseum.org/calendar/oct-10-literary-festival">moderating a panel at the Frye Art Museum</a> with poet John Olson, Fantagraphics publisher Gary Groth, and novelist Matt Briggs. They&rsquo;ll each read and then we&rsquo;ll discuss &ldquo;the boundaries and limits of genre&rdquo; as part of the Frye&rsquo;s ongoing Literary Festival, which is part of the <em>Genius / 21 Century / Seattle</em> exhibit. It&rsquo;s at 2 pm, it&rsquo;s free, and the Frye would be thrilled if you <a href="http://genius.fryemuseum.org/calendar/oct-10-literary-festival">pre-registered for the event</a> on their site.</p>
