<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**I’m a white writer, and I’m writing a historical novel. One of the characters — a villain, I guess you’d say — is racist as fuck. This is important to the plot.**</p>

<p class="noindent">**But every time I write his dialogue, I cringe. He says the n-word a lot. A *lot*. It’s historically appropriate for him to do this, and I try to incorporate other racist synonyms when I can, but the truth is that if this guy was alive then, he’d be saying the n-word a lot. A *lot*.**</p>

<p class="noindent">**Cienna, I’m half-inclined to use asterisks for the word in the body of the novel whenever he says the n-word because I’m so uncomfortable using it, but I think that would be silly and pull the reader out of the story and I don’t think my publisher would allow it.  On the other hand, I’ve noticed that Quentin Tarantino’s movies are aging about as well as *The Jazz Singer* in part because of his rampant use of the n-word. So what should I do?**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sondra,</p>

<p class="noindent">If you publish your manuscript, I can guarantee that no critic or reader will think, "not enough 'N' words for my taste." Part of writing well is understanding the power of language – when powerful words underscore your point and when they disrupt your narrative.</p>

<p>The N word is the most hate-filled word in the American English language. Period. An asterisk does not make it okay to use – if anything, it is an acknowledgement that you shouldn&rsquo;t be using it.</p>

<p>Yes, the word has been used historically in texts and no, I do not believe it should be censored from works like <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, but there is a difference between writing in a period and writing about a period. Your writing is informed by almost 150 years of brutal history after the works of Mark Twain.</p>

<p>As a writer, you know good writing involves showing over telling. There are plenty of ways to show racism and racist thought that are more powerful than going Nuclear – if you&rsquo;re stumped, look to our current president and his administration for examples. Or grab one of the synonyms you&rsquo;ve been using and stick to it – repetition builds meaning, and by layering the racist actions of your character with his repetition of a <em>less hateful</em> word, your readers will have no problem understanding his nature.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,<br>
Cienna</p>
