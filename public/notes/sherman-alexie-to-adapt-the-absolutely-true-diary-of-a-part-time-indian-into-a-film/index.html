<p>The <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hugh-jackman-fox-2000-team-ya-best-seller-absolutely-true-diary-a-part-time-indian-951763">got the scoop</a>: Hugh Jackman and Fox 2000 are helping to bring Seattle author Sherman Alexie&rsquo;s popular YA novel <em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em> to a theater near you. Alexie, who has directed films in the past, will write the screenplay for the adaptation. Jackman will also play a supporting role in the film. This is a big damn deal for a book that has demonstrated remarkable longevity with young readers. Hopefully, with Alexie&rsquo;s involvement, Fox and Jackman will do the book justice.</p>
