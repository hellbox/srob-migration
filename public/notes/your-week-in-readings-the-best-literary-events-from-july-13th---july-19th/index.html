<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday July 13: *HEX* Reading**</h5></p> 
Dutch author Thomas Olde Heuvelt’s horror novel *HEX* was a worldwide bestseller before it was even translated into English. Now it should become a bestseller in America, too; it’s got all the elements of a good horror yarn, including a witch’s curse, imperiled teens, a plague of suicides, and the fate of the known universe.
