<p class="noindent">We're excited to bring you an excerpt from _Fly to the Assemblies!: Seattle and the Rise of the Resistance_, courtesy of sponsor Third Place Press this week. _Fly to the Assemblies_ is a new anthology of writing from Seattle's top thinkers &mdash; journalists, activists, and others &mdash; that speaks to what the city is already doing in this time of political crisis and what we need to do next. As editor, Marcus Harrison Green has brought together a stunning group of voices to engage you on the page &mdash; or in person at the Nov. 2 launch event.</p>

<p>Third Place Press chose &ldquo;On fear and anger and fighting back,” by Reagan Jackson, to share with <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> readers. You know Jackson&rsquo;s writing from <em>Crosscut</em>, <em>The Seattle Globalist</em>, and elsewhere; this piece is a suckerpunch of truth and fury. Read the essay, and an eloquent note about the book&rsquo;s publication from Third Place&rsquo;s Vladimir Verano, on <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/">our sponsor page</a>.</p>
