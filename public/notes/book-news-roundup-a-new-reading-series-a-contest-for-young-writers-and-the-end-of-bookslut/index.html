<li><p>Save the date: the Seward Park branch of Third Place Books will be having its grand opening party on May 21st and May 22nd. This is super-exciting! It&rsquo;s not every day (or even every year) you get to celebrate the grand opening of a new Seattle bookstore. You can (and should) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/987986684649758/">confirm that you&rsquo;ll be there on the Facebook invite</a> for the weekend.</p></li>

<li><p>Save the date, part 2: on June 2nd, you&rsquo;ll get a sneak preview of a new reading series hosted and curated by Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1027624800637684/">Contagious Exchanges: Queer Writers in Conversation</a> is self-described as &ldquo;a monthly series featuring two dynamic writers bridging genre, style, sensibility, and all the markers of identity in queer lives.&rdquo; The official launch will be in October, but the June outing at the Hugo House will be a sort of &ldquo;pilot episode&rdquo; for the series, featuring poets Tara Hardy and Anastacia Tolbert.</p></li>

<li><p>Seattle poet and novelist Karen Finneyfrock just <a href="http://www.karenfinneyfrock.com/youth-novelist-project/">launched something called the &ldquo;Seattle Youth Novelist Project,&rdquo;</a> in which a Seattle writer aged 13-19 will earn a mentorship from Finneyfrock and a spot in a reading this October. If you know any young writers, you should let them know about this. Deadline for submissions is May 30th.</p></li>

<li><p>Where to begin with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/fashion/mens-style/mens-book-clubs.html?_r=0">this stupid <em>New York Times</em> story on men&rsquo;s book clubs</a>? Look, I just don&rsquo;t think this kind of thing should be celebrated: &ldquo;&lsquo;We do not read so-called chick lit,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The main character cannot be a woman.&rsquo;&rdquo; There is nothing newsworthy in men who read only books by men. That&rsquo;s still the status fucking quo. A bunch of men who choose to ignore the experiences and perspectives of 50 percent of the population is, unfortunately, absolutely normal. When you run a media outlet, one of the most important decisions you make is to whom you pass the microphone. These men&rsquo;s book clubs did not deserve the microphone because there is nothing interesting about them. The only good thing to come from this story is the Twitter hashtag #ManlyBookClubNames:</p></li>

<li><p>A lot of writers are getting upset about <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2016/05/rip-bookslut-2002-2016.html">this (very good) interview with Bookslut founder Jessa Crispin</a>. Many Facebook posts have been written refuting Crispin&rsquo;s claim that everyone in modern American literature is &ldquo;super-cheerful because they’re trying to sell you something, and I find it really repulsive. There seems to be less and less underground. And what it’s replaced by is this very professional, shiny, happy plastic version of literature.&rdquo; Frankly, it seems weird to get upset over Crispin&rsquo;s opinion. If your view of American literature differs from hers, that&rsquo;s great. Go revel in the book world you see, and share its joys with others! But if your vision of American literature is somehow threatened by Crispin&rsquo;s negative opinion, to the point where you have to write an angry screed about it, maybe she&rsquo;s got a point?</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of Bookslut, the final issue of the online book review site features <a href="http://www.bookslut.com/features/2016_04_021420.php">a good interview with Seattle writer Eli Sanders</a> about his book <em>While the City Slept</em>. (We <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/03/the-idea-was-to-learn-a-lot-more-about-the-paths-of-all-three-of-the-people-whose-lives-intersected-that-night/">interviewed Sanders about his book</a> a while back.)</p></li>

<li><p>Every month, the University of Chicago gives away a free e-book. This month&rsquo;s free e-book is <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo16552051.html">a very short collection titled <em>Ebert&rsquo;s Bests</em></a>, featuring an autobiographical essay by the late, great Roger Ebert about how he came to be a film critic. Go <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo16552051.html">download the book now</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>One day, publishers will finally figure out a way to bundle an e-book edition with the purchase of a physical book. (It&rsquo;s really not that hard; comics publishers do this all the time.) Until that glorious day, <a href="http://www.teleread.com/shelfie-and-harvard-bookstore-partner-to-bundle-e-books-with-some-houghton-titles/">Harvard Book Store is teaming with an app called Shelfie</a> to offer e-books for sale with certain physical books at a low cost. It&rsquo;s not good enough, but it is at least a single step in the right direction.</p></li>
