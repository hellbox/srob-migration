If you only read one group piece about a particular aspect of the publishing industry today...well, you should read [the piece about the whiteness of the publishing industry that I linked to earlier today](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/25/its-the-whitest-place-ive-ever-been/). But if you have time to read *two* group pieces about a particular aspect of the publishing industry today, you should definitely read [this BookRiot interview](http://bookriot.com/2016/02/24/12-translators-on-why-they-do-what-they-do/) with 12 translators about why they love translation.
