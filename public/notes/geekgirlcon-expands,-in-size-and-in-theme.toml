GeekGirlCon [announced that they're expanding their 2016 show](http://geekgirlcon.com/geekgirlcon-2016-more-space-for-every-geek-everybody/) to include the fourth floor of the Washington State Convention Center, which will give the sci-fi convention a lot more space for its programs and exhibitors. And the theme of this year's show is "Every Geek, Everybody," striking an inclusive tone for the bigger-than-ever show. GeekGirlCon takes place on October 8th and 9th this year; [you can buy tickets here](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2426480z).
