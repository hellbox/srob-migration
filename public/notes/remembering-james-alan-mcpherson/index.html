<p>James Alan McPherson, acclaimed American writer and writing educator, died last month, at the age of 72.</p>

<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1470607077599/mcpherson.jpg" alt="" /></p>McPherson is best known for his wide-ranging 1977 short story collection <em>Elbow Room</em>, which won the Pulitzer Prize. He had worked with and been mentored by Ralph Ellison, an author with a similar eye for the entrenched, neurotic small-mindedness of the American cultural landscape. But McPherson&rsquo;s characters, navigating between situations of generous-minded realism and stark absurdity, are conveyed with a warmth that&rsquo;s unique to him &mdash; even when he&rsquo;s skewering someone, it&rsquo;s with affection.</p>

<p>I studied with McPherson at the University of Iowa Writers&rsquo; Workshop from 1997 to &lsquo;99. When we first met he hadn&rsquo;t published any fiction in two decades, but his kindness and his deep insights about writing drew me to his classes, and then to seek him out as a thesis advisor.</p>

<p>McPherson had been a correspondent for the <em>Atlantic Magazine</em>; in Ta-Nehisi Coates&rsquo; 2014 piece &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/">The Case for Reparations</a>,&rdquo; Coates cites an <em>Atlantic</em> article McPherson wrote in 1974, a report on the Contract Buyers&rsquo; League — an effort by a group of black homebuyers in Chicago to resist the predatory housing contracts forced on them by banks and abusive sellers. McPherson&rsquo;s great long 1969 article about Chicago gangs (&ldquo;Chicago&rsquo;s Blackstone Raiders&rdquo;) is <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1969/05/chicagos-blackstone-rangers-i/305741/">available on the magazine&rsquo;s website</a>: for that piece, McPherson met with gang members and conducted interviews over a six-month period to create a picture of the entrenched and sometimes accidental ways in which gangs, public institutions, and churches simultaneously harmed and helped one another.</p>

<p>McPherson broke his two decades of publishing silence with a memoir called <em>Crabcakes</em>, which came out in hardcover during my first year studying with him. Now that he&rsquo;s passed, it has become his final book. <em>Crabcakes</em> is dense, wandering, floating between time periods, part history, part philosophy, part epistolary, part confession. I watched McPherson read from it to a packed auditorium at the Iowa Memorial Union in 1999, a stand-alone piece of formal satire titled &ldquo;A Useful Demonstration of the Etiquette Necessary for Survival on the Secondary Roads Trailing Off the Busy Interstates During Times of Lapses in Essential Areas of Civil Responsibility, Late Summer, 1983.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s an ironically voiced recap of an interaction McPherson had with a police officer who&rsquo;d pulled him over on a pretext only to discover that McPherson&rsquo;s registration was expired. The piece is a measured, faux-soporific &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; for any black man or woman hoping to survive an encounter with racist small-town law enforcement. When he read it, the audience really laughed. When I reread it this morning, I still laughed, but was struck primarily by the horror of the piece. It&rsquo;s as relevant now as it ever has been, in America. After the officer, with hateful language (which McPherson calls the &ldquo;signal&rdquo;), compels McPherson to exit his car:</p>

<blockquote>Deporting, take care to not make any sudden movements toward either pockets or the interior of the vehicle. Most likely, it will be a personally interested official who will make this sort of signal. It should indicate that similar signals, drawn from the very same storehouse of vernacular expressions, are forthcoming ...</blockquote>

<p>McPherson&rsquo;s character realizes that the challenge before him is to establish, in the mind of this officer, the existence of a common humanity between them. This lifesaving link is the key to survival, and not easily forged when a situation has begun as badly as racialized encounters with authority consistently do:</p>

<blockquote>It is no longer a simple dispute between an official and an offender. It is now an exchange between the scant resources of the reptilian brain and its half-formed image of "other" which has, unfortunately, intruded upon, and blocked, its view of life in its traditional mode.</blockquote>

<p>But this, the satiric voice opines, is no misfortune. Rather, it&rsquo;s an opportunity &ldquo;for an essay at that Reconstruction which, sadly, nowadays, is so everywhere in such great need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A big fan of Richard Pryor, McPherson once asked our workshop, &ldquo;Who are the good comedians now, who tell it like it is, but are still funny?&rdquo; Some people in the class had suggestions, but it was finally agreed that the world was forever poorer for the fact that it would never again have a Richard Pryor.</p>

<p>As with this man, my advisor, teacher, and a first-rate writer — the &ldquo;great need&rdquo; grows greater with each passing year, and for all the wonderful and gifted voices speaking to it, there will never be another like his.</p>
