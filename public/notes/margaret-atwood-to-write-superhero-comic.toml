Margaret Atwood's [first comic](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/12/08/margaret-atwoods-first-comic-book-angel-catbird-from-dark-horse-comics-in-2016/) is called *Angel Catbird*, it's an all-ages story about a hero who gets his genes spliced with a bird and a cat, it comes out fall 2016 from Dark Horse Comics, and it's illustrated by the talented Johnnie Christmas, who drew the Image series *Sheltered*. Sounds weird. I'm in.
