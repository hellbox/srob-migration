<p>Charles Johnson is one of Seattle&rsquo;s literary giants - right up there with authors like Jonathan Raban and Richard Hugo and Denise Levertov. One of Seattle&rsquo;s few National Book Award winners and a MacArthur &ldquo;Genius,&rdquo; Johnson has represented the city at a time when the nation still considered us to be a literary lightweight.</p>

<p>Johnson&rsquo;s fiction has often been celebrated for the way he has corrected the historical record. His historical novels and short stories have helped provide a voice for Black Americans who have been cut out of the history books. He writes exuberantly, with the passion of someone who knows that he doesn&rsquo;t need to ask permission or forgiveness.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that he excelled as a writing teacher, and that he guided, inspired, and shaped generations of young writers at the University of Washington. Though he&rsquo;s retired from the UW, Johnson <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/06/19/talking-with-charles-johnson-about-community-retirement-and-writing-a-whole-lot-of-books/">confirmed in an interview last year</a> that he&rsquo;s still a teacher. His book <em>The Way of the Writer: Reflections on the Art and Craft of Storytelling</em> offers up some of his most compelling thoughts on the writing craft, but Johnson has a whole world of knowledge inside his head that he&rsquo;s eager to share with new generations of writers.</p>

<p>This Thursday, Hugo House is welcoming Johnson to give a talk about the craft of writing as part of their Word Works series. He&rsquo;ll be delivering a lecture based on his essay &ldquo;Storytelling and the Alpha Narrative,&rdquo; and then he&rsquo;ll take audience questions on just about any writing-related topics they can imagine. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to listen to one of our most consequential authors, and to drink in a tiny sip of his oceans of expertise.</p>

<p><em>Annex Theatre. 1100 E Pike St, <a href="http://hugohouse.org">http://hugohouse.org</a>, 7 pm, $15.</em></p>
