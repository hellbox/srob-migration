<p>This, from the Office of Arts and Culture, is <a href="http://officeofartsculture.cmail20.com/t/ViewEmail/y/E7DD47E3E5E1F2EA/1DD6A69E782F1460C45D7BC1A387288D#fy">pretty damn cool</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The Seattle Office of Arts & Culture,(ARTS) in partnership with Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) seeks a practicing, published poet, fiction, or creative non-fiction writer for a unique project-based **artist residency in the northwest tower of the Fremont Bridge**. The selected writer will undertake an in-depth exploration of the bridge and write a piece in response to the experience.</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that students and unpublished writers &ldquo;are not eligible to apply&rdquo; for this residency, but hopefully this project will be successful enough that future residencies will be open to anyone.</p>
