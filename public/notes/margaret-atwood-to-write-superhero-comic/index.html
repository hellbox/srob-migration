<p>Margaret Atwood&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/12/08/margaret-atwoods-first-comic-book-angel-catbird-from-dark-horse-comics-in-2016/">first comic</a> is called <em>Angel Catbird</em>, it&rsquo;s an all-ages story about a hero who gets his genes spliced with a bird and a cat, it comes out fall 2016 from Dark Horse Comics, and it&rsquo;s illustrated by the talented Johnnie Christmas, who drew the Image series <em>Sheltered</em>. Sounds weird. I&rsquo;m in.</p>
