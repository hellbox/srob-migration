<p>Four-thirty, morning. Unearthly time<br>
by nuns&rsquo; or any standard;<br>
almost, this soggy May, monastic.<br>
I close my door on sleep<br>
for other sanctuary,<br>
preceded by the birds<br>
who long ago devised<br>
their daylight saving.<br>
Now, saving the daylight,<br>
no other shape abroad<br>
but the swinging step of rain<br>
on rain-soaked turf.</p>

<p>Unbreakable as doom<br>
five streetlamps watch me come<br>
to keep my tryst.<br>
Nailed each to a man-made cross,<br>
usual as air,<br>
we watch, mechanical,<br>
dawn light dispelling glare;<br>
hooding our early brightness in a cloud<br>
tempers the shock<br>
and orders lonely emanations<br>
by a clock.</p>
