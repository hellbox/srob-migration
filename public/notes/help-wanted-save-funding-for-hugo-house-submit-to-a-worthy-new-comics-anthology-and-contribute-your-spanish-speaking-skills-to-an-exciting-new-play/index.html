<blockquote><p>More vital arts funding is in jeopardy here in Washington State and we need your help. Hugo House was recommended for a grant of over $1M through Washington State's Building for the Arts program. We recently learned that the Senate capital budget did not include funding for all of the groups recommended for supportâ€”Hugo House was right below the cutoff line. This funding is critical toward securing our new home.</p>

<p>Full funding in the House capital budget is now even more critical.</p>

<p>**Please call your State legislators to add your voice in support of FULL FUNDING for Building for the Arts**. A script is provided [[on Hugo House's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/hugohouse/photos/a.217832891060.178515.53183671060/10154972280241061/?type=3&theater)], and your own words are just as important.</p></blockquote>

<li><a href="https://grabbackcomics.com/">Grab Back Comics</a> is an amazing new website collecting comics about sexual assault and consent. The site&rsquo;s founder and editor, Erma Blood, is <a href="https://grabbackcomics.com/2017/03/18/call-for-submissions/#more-872">looking for submissions</a> for an upcoming print anthology. You can find all the information about how to submit on their site, but here&rsquo;s the basic pitch:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Your story matters!! Through May 21, 2017, **Grab Back Comics is accepting submissions of original comics on the topics of sexual assault, harassment, rape culture, or advocacy**. Submissions will be posted on the Grab Back Comics website and included in a printed anthology that will be presented at the Comics & Medicine conference in Seattle in mid June. I will also mail each contributor 3 free copies of the printed comic.</blockquote>

<blockquote>My dear friend Rupert Reyes, who is a tremendous playwright and director from Austin, will be visiting Seattle during the week of April 23. Rupert founded the legendary Teatro Vivo, a tour de force in bilingual theater. I am working on setting up a table reading of one of Rupert's new works in progress and **we are in need of 2 readers for a 1.5-hour play**. The characters are in their 20s, but the readers do not need to reflect this casting. We need 2 female readers who are fairly proficient in Spanish. No prep necessary - this will be a cold reading. We hope to organize an event for the evening of Monday, April 24. Email shinyu.pai@atlasobscura.com if interested.</blockquote>
