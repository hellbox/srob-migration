<p>Had she lived, Sylvia Plath would have been 83 years old today. If you&rsquo;re in the mood, maybe stop by <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/10/27/sylvia-plath-reads-the-disquieting-muses-bbc/">this Brainpickings post</a> and listen to Plath share her thoughts on poetry. As for me, it&rsquo;s a sad occasion; I tend to spend the day thinking about all the work that never made it to the page.</p>

<p>If Plath&rsquo;s birthday reminds you of all the great writing by women that the world never got to read, I&rsquo;d encourage you to pick up <a href="https://medium.com/@paulconstant/dear-diarists-87c58f758f62#.ijll5skje">Kate Zambreno&rsquo;s excellent book <em>Heroines</em></a>, which serves as a celebration of (and lament for) all the women of literature who have been forgotten, or undervalued, or unrecognized. Maybe we should think about making Plath&rsquo;s birthday an official holiday, to remember and to celebrate those voices.</p>
