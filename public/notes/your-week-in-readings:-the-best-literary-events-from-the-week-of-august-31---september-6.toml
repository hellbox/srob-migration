**MONDAY** Our week begins at [Elliott Bay Book Company](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/tom-janikowski-elissa-washuta-amaranth-borsuk-patrick-milan), where the wonderful independent publisher Red Hen Press presents a group reading with Tom Janikowski,Amaranth Borsuk, and Patrick Milan. They’ll all read from their most recent titles. But this reading also features local author Elissa Washuta, author of *My Body is a Book of Rules* and, most recently,  *Starvation Mode*. (You can [read my review of the latter right here](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-perpetual-naked-lunch-of-starvation-mode/).) A reading from Washuta alone is reason to show up, but tonight you’ll get to see three other writers and support a fantastic small press. 

**TUESDAY** It’s back to Elliott Bay Book Company for a 7 pm reading co-presented with Hedgebrook. Naomi Jackson presents her debut novel *The Star Side of Bird Hill*, about young sisters who move from Brooklyn to the Caribbean, where their grandmother lives. Jackson will appear with local poet Anastacia Tolbert, who [graced the *Seattle Review of Books* with a wonderful poem last Tuesday](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/25/rattail/).

**WEDNESDAY** Up at [Third Place Books in Lake Forest Park](http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/lfp-bicycle-built-two-billion-jamie-bianchini), Jamie Bianchini reads from *A Bicycle Built for Two Billion*, his account of riding around the world on a tandem bike. On his trip, Bianchini visited 81 countries in 7 years. He’s got a lot of stories from that experience and, presumably, he’s got a nice pair of legs to show for it, too.

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1440817374706/9781452144160_350.jpg)</p>**THURSDAY** At [Third Place Books Ravenna](http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/ravenna-frida-clements-have-little-pun), local artist Frida Clements reads from her book *Have a Little Pun*, which is a collection of illustrated puns, leaning heavily on the animal side of the pun spectrum. The promo copy for this event reads: “Having a bad hare day? Feeling a little antsy? What the hail, just dill with it, and for fox sake, have a little pun.” Just reading that will probably help you determine if this event is for you or not.

**FRIDAY** Ada’s Technical Books presents [a different kind of writing event](http://www.seattletechnicalbooks.com/max-connect): the software company Cycling ’74 presents a reception and demonstration celebrating an updated version of their programming language, Max 7. There will also, reportedly be “swag.” 

**SATURDAY** [University Book Store](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=09&evyear=2015&eventid=2015070909304900&pre=20150901&pst=20150913) presents Portland author Michael McGregor, author of *Pure Act*, which is a biography of minimalist poet Robert Lax. How minimalist? I’ll let [Wikipedia spell it out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lax): “Over the years the poems became more and more minimalist, sometimes consisting of single words, even single syllables, running down page after page, often in varying colors.”


**SUNDAY** [Hugo House hosts](http://hugohouse.org/event/moss-volume-1-celebration-rebecca-brown-matt-briggs-janie-miller-and-miriam-cook/) the very first party for the gorgeous [local online literary magazine *Moss*](http://www.mosslit.com/vol01/issue03.html). Co-founders Connor Guy and Alex Davis-Lawrence will host, present four awesome readers (Rebecca Brown, Matt Briggs, Janie Miller, and Miriam Cook,) and talk about the future of *Moss*, which will involve a physical manifestation. This is the book party of the week, without question.
