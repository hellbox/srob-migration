<p>The library <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/2017/0505/Obama-unveils-ambitious-plans-for-an-unusual-new-presidential-library-in-Chicago">looks gorgeous</a> and the plan for it to be a community center in the South Side of Chicago is wonderful. Something that I&rsquo;m not happy about: it&rsquo;s going to be the <strong>first paperless presidential library</strong>. You&rsquo;d think that a president who loves books as much as Obama would understand the value of the printed word. In a world full of bad news, I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time or energy complaining about this. But still, it&rsquo;s a little disappointing.</p>
