<p class="noindent">
This week's sponsor, Linda Joy Myers, joins us with a chapter from her recently published memoir, *Song of the Plains* â€” a tale as vast as the Great Plains on which it's set, spanning the lives of three generations of Oklahoma women: grandmother, mother, daughter. It's a tale of history, family, and transformation, of "secret stories" brought into the great wide open through forty years of painstaking research.</p>

<p>And Linda Joy Myers knows memoir: she&rsquo;s president of the National Association of Memoir Writers, a memoir coach and teacher, and the author of multiple books on the craft. She thought she was done with her own story, until this book started whispering too loudly to ignore. Preview the first chapter and get a taste of the &ldquo;wild and reckless country&rdquo; where her family&rsquo;s history takes place.</p>
