"Nearly every woman I know has either had an abortion or helped another woman get one," begins [the latest post on local author Lesley Hazleton's blog](http://accidentaltheologist.com/2015/08/27/my-abortion/). Hazleton is a brilliant writer, a fearless thinker, and a deeply compassionate human being, and in this post she puts all those qualities to the service of one important cause. Hazleton wants to "break the weird veil of shame and secrecy that still hangs over the decision" to have an abortion, "even when abortion is legal." She thinks it's important to "stand up and say 'Yes, sure, I had one.'" She continues: "So hereâ€™s the story of mine."

[Go read the whole post](http://accidentaltheologist.com/2015/08/27/my-abortion/). In the comments, Hazleton says she's organizing a January event at Town Hall "with thirty women speaking two minutes each, telling their own stories." As soon as she announces the date for that, we'll let you know.
