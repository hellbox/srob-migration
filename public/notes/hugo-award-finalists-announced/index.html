<p>Carolyn Kellogg <a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-hugo-awards-the-complete-finalist-lst-20160426-story.html">at Jacket Copy</a> has the full list of the sci-fi/fantasy Hugo Award finalists. Here&rsquo;s the novel category:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Ancillary Mercy</em> by Ann Leckie</li>
<li><em>The Cinder Spires: The Aeronaut&rsquo;s Windlass</em> by Jim Butcher</li>
<li><em>The Fifth Season</em> by N.K. Jemisin</li>
<li><em>Seveneves: A Novel</em> by Neal Stephenson</li>
<li><em>Uprooted</em> by Naomi Novik</li>
</ul>

<p>Kate Macdonald <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/pronouns-in-space/">reviewed the first book in Leckie&rsquo;s Ancillary series, <em>Ancillary Justice</em></a>, for us last year. And our cofounder <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/sticking-the-landing/">Martin McClellan reviewed Stephenson&rsquo;s <em>Seveneves</em></a> almost a year ago.</p>

<p>Of course, last year, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/23/hugo-award-winners-announced/">the Hugo Awards finalists were overtaken by a horde of men&rsquo;s rights dimbulbs</a>, and I see some of those same names on some of the categories again this year. But those conservative jackasses didn&rsquo;t win any awards last year, and they won&rsquo;t win this year. Let&rsquo;s not make the story about a few loud and crass white men. Instead, let&rsquo;s celebrate the sci-fi writers who deserve our celebration.</p>
