<p>John Jackson Miller <a href="http://blog.comichron.com/2017/01/whither-new-york-times-graphic-novel.html">at Comichron</a> reports on some apparent upcoming changes to the <em>New York Times</em>&rsquo;s bestseller list, including the deletion of the graphic novel bestsellers. He continues:</p>

<blockquote>Following an early report, I communicated with a contact who receives an advance copy [of the list] who noted there are further changes, including the elimination of the mass-market paperback charts and the merger of the e-book-only list with the fiction list. Other categories are reduced in size; the adult trade fiction list goes from 15 entries to 10, while the highest-profile list, the hardcovers, is cut from 20 entries to 15.</blockquote>
