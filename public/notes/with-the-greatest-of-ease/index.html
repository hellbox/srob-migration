<p><p class="noindent">We&rsquo;ve all dreamed about making the big leap: a new job, a new country, a new life. Molly McCord did all three, leaving a stable but unsatisfying career in Seattle to start over in Paris, a city she&rsquo;d never seen. She shares the story in <em>The Art of Trapeze</em> â€” part memoir, part instruction manual for choosing a different path. As the title implies, trusting yourself as your feet leave the platform is the hardest and most necessary part. Read a sample chapter, provided just for <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> readers, and enjoy McCord&rsquo;s trademark blend of humor, honesty, and self-reflection. If you like it (and you will), the book is twenty percent off through August at her site.</p>
