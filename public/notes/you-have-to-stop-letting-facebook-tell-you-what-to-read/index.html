<p>A few years ago, publishers allowed Facebook to become basically their sole source of traffic. Now, Facebook is <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/will-facebooks-media-divorce-backfire">cutting traffic to news feeds</a> in an attempt to staunch the flow of fake news.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, brainy blog The Awl moved all their pieces over to blogging site Medium, presumably in search of a business model that would sustain the site. (You don&rsquo;t change everything about your publishing model unless your publishing model needs serious help.) Last year, <a href="http://www.adweek.com/digital/the-awl-is-the-latest-publication-to-leave-medium/">The Awl divorced from Medium</a> and went solo again. This month, <a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/01/the-awl-to-stop-publishing.html?utm_campaign=nym&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=s1">The Awl will close entirely</a>. I very much enjoyed The Awl, which was basically a smarter, more patient, better-written Gawker. And now it is dead.</p>

<p>Look, friends. I don&rsquo;t want to make you feel guilty, but if your internet experience begins and ends with Facebook, this is kind of your fault. You own some of this.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think you should do, instead: find an RSS reader that works for you. <a href="http://newsblur.com/">I pay for NewsBlur</a>, because it&rsquo;s a great service and I like paying for services that I want to stay around. It&rsquo;s not based on a super-sketchy advertising model. There are some <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/top-free-online-rss-readers-3486649">free RSS readers out there</a>, though.</p>

<p>Once you choose an RSS reader, you should subscribe to the news sites that you like. Then, get into the habit of checking your RSS feed throughout the day. Don&rsquo;t feel as though you have to read everything; think of it as an email inbox. Some of it is obviously not interesting or relevant to you. Delete with abandon.</p>

<p>And if you&rsquo;re a writer: start a blog. Write about what you&rsquo;re interested in. Be plucky. Be opinionated. Don&rsquo;t have hot takes, though â€” cultivate some beats. Write about things you care about, ignore the rest. If you have other friends who write blogs, you should team up with them and make a bigger blog. Write well. You&rsquo;ll attract readers. And you should promote the writers and sources you like, too.</p>

<p>Look, if we learn nothing else from the 2016 elections, it should be this: what we read is way too important to leave up to anyone else. When we allow someone else to control our media intake, we&rsquo;re giving up a tremendous amount of power. We&rsquo;ve got to take that power back.</p>
