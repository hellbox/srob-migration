<p>Shelf Awareness <a href="http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2640#m30610">reports that</a> Bellingham&rsquo;s grand old bookshop, Village Books, has opened a new, 3,000-square-foot location in Lynden, a town just north of Bellingham. Between this and the new branch of Third Place Books in Seward Park that&rsquo;s opening in early 2016, it&rsquo;s time for the media to put away the tired &ldquo;bookstores are dying&rdquo; narrative for something newer, fresher, and more optimistic.</p>
