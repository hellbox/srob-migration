<p>Over the weekend, the Washington State Book Awards were given out in a ceremony at Seattle Public Library. Mary Ann Gwinn at the <em>Seattle Times</em> has <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/winners-of-the-washington-state-book-awards/">a full list of winners</a>. It&rsquo;s nice to see the awards spread around the state — winners include Spokane County novelist Bruce Holbert, Spokane poet Tod Marshall, and Tacoma historian Justin Wadland — but it&rsquo;s disappointing to see that the major adult awards went to white dudes.  <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/27/talking-with-nicola-griffith-about-the-importance-of-counting-womens-stories/">Demographics matter, people.</a></p>
