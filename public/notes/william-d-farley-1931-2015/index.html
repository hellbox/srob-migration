<p><a href="http://seattlemysteryblog.typepad.com/seattle_mystery/2015/06/we-regret-to-inform-you.html">Seattle Mystery Bookshop has announced</a> that their co-founder, <a href="http://seattlemysteryblog.typepad.com/seattle_mystery/2015/06/bill-farley-dec-12-1931-june-28-2015.html">William D. Farley</a>, passed away on Sunday, June 28th, &ldquo;just three days short of the shopâ€™s 25th birthday.&rdquo; Our thoughts are with the staff of Seattle Mystery Bookshop at what must be a tremendously difficult time. What a legacy, though! The store he helped found is keeping a proud tradition of Pioneer Square bookshops alive.</p>
