<p>The editors behind the excellent 33 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> series of books about albums have <a href="http://333sound.com/2015/07/29/open-call-2015-the-complete-list-of-albums-proposed-for-the-33-13-series/">published all the information</a> collected during their recent open submission process. It&rsquo;s a fascinating look at why the new-arrivals tables at your local bookstore are still dominated by books by and about men.</p>

<p>Of 605 book proposals received, <strong>18.3 percent were written by female authors</strong> and 81.7 percent were by male authors. Not even twenty percent of submissions were from women! That&rsquo;s horrendous. Even worse is the gender split of the musicians these writers want to write about: 11.3 percent of all these pitches were about female artists, and 8.7 percent were for mixed-gender or undefined acts. The remaining 80 percent of submissions were about dudes.</p>

<p>We should be grateful to 33 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> for being so transparent about all this. It&rsquo;s another damning mound of data we can add to <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/27/talking-with-nicola-griffith-about-the-importance-of-counting-womens-stories/">the work Nicola Griffith has been doing</a> to unveil the publishing industry&rsquo;s institutional sexism. If you haven&rsquo;t already, you should <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/27/talking-with-nicola-griffith-about-the-importance-of-counting-womens-stories/">read Griffith&rsquo;s explanation</a> of how we can help women&rsquo;s voices be heard in literature. It&rsquo;s up to all of us to make a change.</p>
