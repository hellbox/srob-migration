<p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the Young Animal line of comics curated by My Chemical Romance frontman Gerard Way. They&rsquo;re a pop-up imprint published on the fringes of the DC Comics superhero properties, taking on the same rebellious-goth-teen role that Vertigo Comics did back in the 1990s. The best Young Animal books, like <em>Mother Panic</em>, fill in a gap left by the all-ages edict of mainstays like Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. They&rsquo;re a little bit weirder, a little bit more imaginative, a lot looser.</p>

<p>This week saw the first issue of <em>Milk Wars</em>, a crossover between Young Animal comics and DC Comics. If you&rsquo;ve ever been disgusted with the crass action-figure ballet that is the typical superhero crossover, you&rsquo;ll probably find something to love here.</p>

<p><em>Milk Wars</em> is a meta-crossover pitting the weird heroes of the Doom Patrol versus the staid, conservative heroes of the DC Universe. And thanks to an intergalactic bureaucracy called Retconn, the DC Universe has been made even more conservative. Superman is a flying milkman. The other Justice League figures have been recast as the Community League of Rhode Island, a staid suburban homeowners association with superpowers.</p>

<p>This feels like a crossover with something to say, which is a rarity for the genre. Of course, some of that conservatism of the mainstream DC line rubs off on the Doom Patrol; while the Young Animal books are generally content to be weird without bragging about how weird they are, in this comic they&rsquo;re painfully self-aware.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the best people are weirdos,&rdquo; a Doom Patrol member says while in the middle of a fight with the godlike milkman, and the point is made. But then two panels later, she adds, &ldquo;everyone&rsquo;s a little strange, and that&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; Later on, someone says &ldquo;maybe strange deserves a shot.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s nothing less weird than talking about how weird you are; the repetition gives off the impression of a coffee cup that reads &ldquo;You Don&rsquo;t Have to Be Crazy to Work Here, But It Helps!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is probably the reason Vertigo began enforcing a concrete divider between itself and the mainstream DC superhero universe in the late 1990s. When you combine the two tones into a single book, you get something that feels a little smaller than its component parts. Milk Wars, at least, seems to recognize that flaw and builds it into the plot.</p>

<p>And in <em>Milk Wars</em> #1, you get several full-page shots of people with bizarre powers punching each other, which is the point of these whole things, right? Can there be anything more dull, anything more in direct opposition to art, than conflict for conflict&rsquo;s sake? And isn&rsquo;t there maybe a chance for some art to made out of that artlenssness?</p>
