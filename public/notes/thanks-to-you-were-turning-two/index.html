<p class="noindent">This week marks the anniversary of our first publication, two years ago. Can you believe it?</p>

<p>How lucky are we, being able to publish local original content, day after day. Publish nearly two hundred reviews, a huge parcel of poems, and enough daily columns to keep even the most fidgety Seattle reader eye-deep in words. We&rsquo;ve had some triumphs, and some stumbles, but through it all one thing has remained constant: <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s because of you that we are able to sell sponsorships to the best crowd of advertisers the world has to offer. Everybody who wants to get the word out has a myriad of ways to do so. But our sponsors choose to share their work here; their new books, their best events, their opportunities for writers to gather and learn. Along the way, they directly pay for the great writing you see on this site.</p>

<p>Instead of running a call for sponsors this week, we just wanted to take an opportunity to thank our sponsors, and thank our readers. You&rsquo;re what makes this community great. Happy anniversary to us all.</p>

<p>(of course, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/">we won&rsquo;t stop you from buying a sponsorship if you really want to</a> &hellip; We&rsquo;ve nearly sold out our August-January block!)</p>
