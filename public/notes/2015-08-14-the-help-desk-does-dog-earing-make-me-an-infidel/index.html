        <p class="intro">*Every Friday, Cienna Madrid offers solutions to life’s most vexing literary problems. Do you need a book recommendation to send your worst cousin on her birthday? Is it okay to read erotica on public transit? Cienna can help. Send your questions to* advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p>

<p><strong>Is dog-earing the pages of a book morally, ethically, or spiritually wrong? What about underlining?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Brooke from Capitol Hill**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Brooke,</p>

<p>In a world where Ted Nugent, Donald Trump, and Mark Driscoll can all boast of being <em>New York Times</em> bestselling authors, I have a hard time labeling anything short of a ham sandwich wrapped in pages of the Koran as morally, ethically, or spiritually wrong (especially if the infidel sandwich is thrown its own ticker-tape parade in Mecca during Ramadan).</p>

<p>But I digress.</p>

<p>A good book should have a much longer lifespan than you and far more friends than could fit at your funeral. So yes, there is an etiquette to how you handle good books and this is it: Use pen only for inscriptions. If you want to underline or respond to select passages, do it in pencil so that when you’re dead, your loved ones can read your thoughts and then carefully erase them. If you highlight anything outside of a school textbook, you are a dick (even then, turning text an aggressively hard-to-read shade does not make it more knowable. Learn to take notes like a civilized person.)</p>

<p>Finally, don’t dog-ear pages. On the scale of infidel sandwiches, this gaffe is more upsetting than sacrilegious (think Jesus stumping for Subway’s new gluten-free tuna melt). Still, if you can’t find one old receipt, gum wrapper, divorce decree, etc. to mark your place in a book then you&rsquo;re about as useful as Trump&rsquo;s thoughts on the economy, Driscoll&rsquo;s thoughts on women, and Nugent&rsquo;s thoughts on everything else.</p>

<p class="noindent">You’re welcome,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
