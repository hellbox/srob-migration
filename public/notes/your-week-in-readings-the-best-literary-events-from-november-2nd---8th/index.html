<p><strong>MONDAY</strong> <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/andrea-kleine-mattilda-bernstein-sycamore">Elliott Bay Book Company</a> kicks off our week in readings with <em>Calf</em>, <strong>Andrea Kleine</strong>’s debut novel. Here’s an introductory note you’ll find before the first page of <em>Calf</em>:</p>

<p class="image">![](/webhook-uploads/1446264520949/Screen%20Shot%202015-10-30%20at%208.33.57%20PM.png)</p>

<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t grab your attention, I don&rsquo;t know what will. Kleine will be appearing with delightful Seattle author <strong>Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore</strong>, who will read new work.</p>

<p><strong>TUESDAY</strong> <strong>Marion Nestle</strong>, who is  a nutrition expert, reads at <a href="https://townhallseattle.org/event/marion-nestle/">Town Hall</a> from her book <em>Soda Politics</em>. It’s about how the soda industry has willfully caused “increased rates of obesity, risk for Type 2 Diabetes, [and] poor dental health” in people all over the world. She also prescribes some solutions and highlights some anti-soda campaigns that have worked around the world.</p>

<p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong> Okay, it’s time for a programming note: this week is <strong>incredibly loaded down with great-looking events</strong>. I could highlight three or four events for every night this week — for instance, <strong>Sloane Crosley</strong> is reading at Elliott Bay Book Company tonight. But tonight at the <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/orhan-pamuk-walter-g-andrews-seattle-public-central-library">Seattle Public Library</a>, <strong>Orhan Pamuk</strong> will be reading from his newest book, <em>A Strangeness in My Mind</em>. Crosley is one of the funniest writers at work today, but Pamuk has won the Nobel Prize for Literature, so he obviously comes out on top.</p>

<p><strong>THURSDAY</strong> At <a href="http://hugohouse.org/event/cheap-wine-poetry-4/">Hugo House</a>  it’s time for the last Cheap Wine and Poetry of the year. Your readers tonight are *Poetry Northwest*’s <strong>Kevin Craft</strong>, memoirist <strong>Nicole Hardy</strong>, self-professed “creative heartist” <strong>Nikkita Oliver</strong>, and the indomitable <strong>Ed Skoog</strong>. Wine, as always, is $1 a glass.</p>

<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong> Remember what I said about every night of the week being overstuffed with events? The <strong>Carrie Brownstein and Maria Semple</strong> reading at <a href="http://www.stgpresents.org/tickets/alphabetical/event/1301/">The Neptune</a> is very likely to have sold out by now, so let’s direct our attention to a smaller, very worthy event: at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1624864237775697/">Left Bank Books</a>, Vancouver poets <strong>Kevin Spenst and Jeff Steudel</strong> will read from their latest books. Spenst’s debut collection is riddled with pop culture and the landscape of Vancouver. It’s titled <em>Jabbering with Bing Bong</em>. Steudel’s <em>Foreign Park</em> is about the history and ecology of the Fraser River. It’s not every night you get to attend a reading at Left Bank Books; go celebrate one of Seattle&rsquo;s best bookstores.</p>

<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong> <a href="https://townhallseattle.org/event/brangien-davis/">Town Hall Scholar in residence <strong>Brangien Davis</strong></a>, who was until recently the arts and culture editor of <em>Seattle</em> magazine, will give a tour  of Town Hall’s hidden gem, “an Austin Universal Air Chest, a 2023-pipe organ that was installed in 1923.” The organ hasn’t worked in a long time, but Davis will investigate the way it’s blended into the building, and she’ll talk about what it might take to bring the organ back to life.</p>

<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong> At <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/gloria-steinem-cheryl-strayed-benaroya-hall-0">Benaroya Hall</a> tonight, <strong>Gloria Steinem</strong> will present her new memoir, <em>My Life on the Road</em>. She will be interviewed by <strong>Cheryl Strayed</strong>, and Seattle singer/songwriter <strong>Hollis Wong-Wear</strong> will perform new music. This is obviously going to be a very special evening.</p>
