<p>late morning (after a long restless<br>
night) blurry eyes focus on the ceiling,<br>
sky in shadows, the clock projects<br>
11:11 neon against the wall</p>

<p>an accusation somewhere vague<br>
in my brain, tainted modern<br>
criminal, off-balance, sleeping-in<br>
11:12 is the turn-key</p>

<p>out of bed into the cool room<br>
exit the womb between<br>
blanket and sheet, blasted<br>
with air, light and dust<br>
one must cross through<br>
each day with an agenda<br>
(formed, or not) this critical<br>
movement, one world to the next</p>

<p>we traverse our time<br>
fractured, come to terms<br>
but the point is to awaken<br>
alive, to drag our self from<br>
the dead of sleep</p>
