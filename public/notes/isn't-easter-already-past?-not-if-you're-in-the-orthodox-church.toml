If you're in the Orthodox church, Easter is still ahead, on May 1st this year. We're welcoming back sponsor Charlotte Riggle, whose children's book _Catherine's Pascha_ follows a little girl's quest to stay awake for the overnight Pascha, or Easter, service. 

If you're not Orthodox, maybe you'll be wondering why the family next door are loading up the car with sleepy children all dressed up come April 30th. This book is a great way of understanding the faith of your neighbors and friends, and introducing children to the many ways that different people in the world worship. See a full-color sample from the book on our sponsor's page.

If you're a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, [take a look at our open dates](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/). We'd love to talk to you about opportunities to sponsor us. It's our way of making internet advertising something to look forward to.
