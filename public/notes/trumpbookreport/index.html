<p>I got my ballot in the mail last night and I happily voted and mailed the damn thing back immediately and it felt so damned good, like the horse that&rsquo;s been sitting square in the center of my chest finally got up and moseyed away in search of some hay or something. (Not that you asked me or anything, but I heartily recommend <a href="http://seattlish.com/post/151982549421/the-official-seattlish-guide-to-your-ballot">Seattlish&rsquo;s voting guide</a> to help identify the lesser-known names on the ballot.) This is almost over. We can do it.</p>

<p>In the meantime, <a href="http://www.mhpbooks.com/trumpbookreport-gives-us-the-america-we-deserve/">Melville House did a very good job of capturing the best #trumpbookreports</a> that were spinning around Twitter yesterday. Some of them are very funny. Go read them, and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23trumpbookreport&amp;src=typd">search the hashtag</a>, and laugh a little bit at the book jokes, and then vote, and soon — Nate Silver willing — you will never, ever have to think of that horrid man ever again.</p>
