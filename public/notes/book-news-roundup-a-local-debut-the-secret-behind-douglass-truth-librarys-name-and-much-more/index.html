<blockquote>It has been life-affirming to see so many writers bless us with some of their first professionally published piecesâ€Šâ€”â€Šwomen writers of color, trans writers, queer writers, disabled writersâ€Šâ€”â€Štalking about some of the most important issues of the day with actual lived experience. I have loved knowing that every piece is edited with integrity, and that every writer is paid for their labor. To be a member of the founding team of a rare platform that is fair and equitable and treats all writers with respect has given my work more purpose and satisfaction than I could have ever imagined.</blockquote>

Better yet, actually try it on your own bookshelves. It only took Loganberry Books 2 hours to do this with their 10,000 titles.</p></li>
