<p>We may have been young and stupid<br>
We tried things this life<br>
We survived to tell or hold our tongue</p>

<p>I only wanted good teeth</p>

<p>It was the kind of day that kissed<br>
my adrenals, I was in love but didnâ€™t<br>
know, I forget his essential nature</p>

<p>Looking at altars I swim the undersea</p>

<p>Our art, how we breathe it<br>
becomes our moment of forgiveness</p>

<p>Everything essential dies or disappears<br>
Fear takes us out of our body</p>

<p>I waited forever to sing</p>

<p>They wrote a song with ordinary<br>
words about an ordinary man<br>
I could not stand to listen</p>

<p>The whole world cries each day<br>
Let the bells ring</p>
