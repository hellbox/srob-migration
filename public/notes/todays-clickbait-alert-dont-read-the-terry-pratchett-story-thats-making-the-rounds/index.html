<p>Some asshole at the <em>Guardian</em> who has never read one of Terry Pratchett&rsquo;s novels thinks Terry Pratchett is overrated. Yep, it&rsquo;s the same old boring &ldquo;serious literature&rdquo; conversation, with an added smear on a recently deceased author for good measure.</p>

<p>This is an obvious plea for attention, <strong>and you should ignore it</strong>. Go read a Terry Pratchett novel instead; if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with his work, we recommend <em>Mort</em> or <em>The Colour of Magic</em> to get you started. If you think you really must read this asshole&rsquo;s incendiary comments, <a href="http://www.donotlink.com/framed?770655">follow this Do Not Link link</a> to the story to find out exactly how dumb it really is. But really, <strong>the correct response to dumb pieces like this is to ignore them</strong>. That&rsquo;s the only way that sites will stop running dumb clickbait. They&rsquo;re literally profiting off your outrage.</p>
