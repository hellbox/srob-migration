<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday July 6: *Collecting the Dead* Signing
**</h5></p> 
Former Whatcom County Sheriff’s Office crime analyst Spencer Kope brings his debut mystery/thriller *Collecting The Dead* to Pioneer Square’s longest-running independent bookstore. *Collecting* is about an FBI agent with the power to track anybody anywhere—except for the one serial killer who previously escaped his grasp.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday July 7: BOOM: Changing Seattle**</h5></p>
The big editorial brains behind the upcoming anthology *Ghosts of Seattle Past* present new work as part of a new art show devoted to honoring Seattle “places lost, preserved and desired during moments of rapid development and growth.” With new art from C. Davida Ingram, No Touching Ground, and Rodrigo Valenzuela.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday July 8: *Away* with Nancy Pearl**</h5></p>
Calling librarian Nancy Pearl a “Seattle treasure” undercuts her wide-ranging appeal; she belongs to the world now. But Seattleites do have the unique honor of attending Pearl’s monthly book club at University Book Store. This month, she’s discussing novelist Amy Bloom’s magnificent immigrant novel *Away*. Go bask in Pearl’s heroic literacy.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday July 9: *Intruder* Release Party**</h5></p>
It’s a big damn celebration for the 20th and final issue of the greatest cartooning newspaper in Seattle history. Intruder staff and contributors will hand out copies of their last issue, local cartoonists and small press will present an outdoor book fair, comics genius Josh Simmons will sign books, and everyone will get a little bit weepy after drinking too many beers. *Fantagraphics Bookstore & Gallery, 1201 Vale St., 658-0110, http://fantagraphics.com/flog/bookstore. Free. All ages. 5 p.m.*


<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday July 10: Southern Biscuits Cooking Class**</h5></p>
Fuck brunch. Why bother waiting in a ridiculous line with your hungover friends to pay way too much money for weird bread products when you could learn how to make nature’s perfect brunch, instead? Brian Medford of Idewild Biscuits and Bakes pop-up bakery will teach a class of ten how to make sweet and savory biscuits.
