<p>What a terrific email to get on a Thursday afternoon: Fantagraphics Books just announced that they&rsquo;re publishing the next book from Seattle cartoonist Ellen Forney. With her debut full-length graphic novel, <em>Marbles</em>, Forney eloquently shared her story as a bipolar artist. <em>Rock Steady: Brilliant Advice From My Bipolar Life</em> will offer autobiographical anecdotes and observations about &ldquo;how to overcome the hassle of meds, recognize red flags, and other tools from her own experience of 14 years of stability - all in comics form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the cover:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful to see Forney publishing with Fantagraphics again — Seattle publishers should represent Seattle authors whenever they can — and it&rsquo;s awesome to see Forney continue to take on the stigma surrounding mental health topics.</p>

<p>Now, the bad news: <em>Rock Steady</em> is not coming out until 2018. Comics take time to make, folks.</p>
