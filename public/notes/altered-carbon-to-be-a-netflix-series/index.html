<p>Deadline <a href="http://deadline.com/2016/01/altered-carbon-drama-series-laeta-kalogridis-netflix-skydance-1201684680/">reports that</a> Richard Morgan&rsquo;s sci-fi novel <em>Altered Carbon</em> is on track to become a Netflix series.</p>

<p><em>Altered Carbon</em> is a cyberpunk detective thriller in the style of William Gibson about digital immortality in a world 500 years from now. It&rsquo;s a spectacular, fun novel and you should give it a try. Adaptations are a fine thing — Netflix has a pretty good track record when it comes to their programming — but a year from now, when everybody is talking about <em>Altered Carbon</em>, you&rsquo;re going to want to read the original. Read it now so you&rsquo;re ahead of the curve and so that you don&rsquo;t have to buy the crappy tie-in cover with a photo of TV stars and a Netflix logo plastered on the front of the book. You&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>
