<p>Two more to go. The 18th issue of <em>Intruder</em>, Seattle’s free, invitation-only comics anthology, is available around town right now, which means only issues 19 and 20 are left before the whole operation folds. Everything seems more acute when a countdown timer’s running, of course, so it’s hard to say for sure, but this issue of <em>Intruder</em> certainly feels more…<em>Intruder</em>-ier than ever before: thicker, full of a wider variety of comics, even livelier than usual.</p>

<p>One of the high points of this issue is Tom Van Deusen’s “Autobiographical Comic Strip,” in which a seemingly mundane trip to the UW Medicine building in Ravenna is upturned by some delightful physical comedy involving a duck. Van Deusen’s art keeps getting tighter and more interesting with every new pages of comics he produces; he’s starting to develop a line that looks very similar to former Seattle cartoonist Jason Lutes, only with more of a sense of fun.</p>

<p>Other strips in this issue share that absurdist comedy vibe. Brandon Lehmann’s dark-but-funny “Stranger Danger” is about a wizard who keeps alternating attempts to lure a young boy into his van with exasperated outbursts when the boy is too easily duped. Seth Goodkind reaches out to a horrific newspaper comic strip deity in hopes of discovering the secrets of comedy. Marc Palm’s strip investigates the weird world of sexually experimental music.</p>

<p>But this issue of <em>Intruder</em> also presents some social commentary — “Urban Distress,” by Marie Hausauer delivers a modest proposal combining haute couture and Seattle’s homelessness problem — and an earnest David Bowie tribute from David Lasky, along with surrealist art pieces like Tim Miller’s full-page illustration of…well&hellip;<em>something</em> — a quasi-religious pin-up featuring a bunch of arms and shapes and white space that looks like it could change your life under just the right blend of hallucinogenic drugs. In fact, <em>Intruder</em> has even less of a house style than it did a few months ago. The issue sprays from earnest to painfully ironic, from dense craftsmanship to abstract carelessness. If you can find a thematic link between all these strips, you’re a more astute reader than I.</p>

<p>Since *Intruder*’s organizers announced the impending end of the magazine, <em>Intruder</em> has only become more interesting. It feels less like a ferocious, impassioned mission statement for Seattle’s comics community, the way it did when <em>Intruder</em> first started, and more like a celebration of itself. With each passing issue, <em>Intruder</em> looks more like <em>Intruder</em> as it prepares to disappear forever. These are the issues that young cartoonists will try to evoke in years to come when they put together their own anthologies. I can hear them now — telling each other, “no, we should make it more like <em>Intruder</em>,” and everyone will know exactly what they mean by that.</p>
