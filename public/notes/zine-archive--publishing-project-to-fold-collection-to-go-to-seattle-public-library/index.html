<p>G&amp;O Family Cyclery owner Davey Oil, an early ZAPP coordinator, just <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hi.davey.oil/posts/721220344712418">published the news in a moving public post on Facebook</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Just got an email from ZAPP, the Zine Archive and Publishing Project, that the organization is finally folding.</p>

<p>The zine collection will be in good hands, at the CEN branch of Seattle Public Library.</p>

<p>The independent nonprofit called ZAPP will cease programming and has found worthy places to donate their remaining budget.</p></blockquote>

<p>ZAPP, the freewheeling zine library founded in the Hugo House basement, <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/Content?oid=16509272">parted ways with the House back in 2013</a>. It is one of the largest zine and minicomics collections in the world. Seattle Public Library has been minding ZAPP&rsquo;s physical collection for years, while ZAPP volunteers tried to garner enthusiasm to make ZAPP its own stand-alone nonprofit entity.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve reached out to SPL to find out their plans for the collection; we&rsquo;ll let you know when we hear back.</p>
