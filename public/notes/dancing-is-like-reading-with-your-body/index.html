<p><em>SRoB</em> has already declared what we believe to be <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/17/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-the-week-of-august-17-august-23/">the best-looking literary events of the week</a>, but there are a couple of <strong>music-themed literary fundraisers</strong> coming up that we want you to know about.</p>

<p>Tomorrow night, the good folks behind Lit Crawl are throwing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/878837925503492/">a 90&rsquo;s-themed dance party at Fred Wildlife Refuge</a>, as a way to raise money for the (entirely free) Crawl. It&rsquo;s $5 at the door. As the invitation puts it:</p>

<blockquote>sweet 90s nostalgia + raffle + silent auction + dance off + good feelings + anticipation for the big event on October 22</blockquote>

<p>On Friday, local author-band The Rejections and Trailing Spouses will be <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/seattle7writers-rejections">playing a show in Elliott Bay Book Company&rsquo;s reading room</a> as a fundraiser for the very worthy <a href="http://www.camptentrees.org/~camptent/">Camp Ten Trees</a>. This event, too, is $5, which includes entry and food and drink.</p>

<p>Even we must acknowledge that life is not best enjoyed through readings alone. Go and get your dance on, and support two worthy causes while you do it.</p>
