<p>A couple weeks ago, I listened to the podcast <em>S-Town</em>. It was exactly as compelling as you’ve heard — a story of death and crime and poverty and hatred and mental illness. Of course the story of <em>S-Town</em> is more complex than just what’s in the narrative— the way it’s told, the elements of the story that don’t appear in the audio, are part of the podcast’s puzzle-box fascination.</p>

<p>It occurred to me as I was listening to <em>S-Town</em>, though, that fifteen years ago, before the dawn of podcasts, the story almost certainly would have arrived in the form of a book. In fact, you could easily argue that the story of <em>S-Town</em> would likely be <em>better served</em> in book form.</p>

<p>Podcasts are terrific ways to relay certain kinds of information — interviews, current events, deep dives into a single topic. But the nuance of <em>S-Town</em> isn’t especially great for a podcast, which is a medium that continually moves forward. Books are better-suited to address the kind of complicated questions raised in <em>S-Town</em> — the recursive questions of reporting and ethics and respecting the wishes of the dead while honoring their legacies.</p>

<p><em>S-Town</em> is in the spirit of two recent true crime books by local authors: Eli Sanders&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/03/the-idea-was-to-learn-a-lot-more-about-the-paths-of-all-three-of-the-people-whose-lives-intersected-that-night/"><em>While the City Slept</em></a> and Claudia Rowe&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/quid-pro-quo/"><em>The Spider and the Fly</em></a>. Both of those books provided context, introspection, and complex narratives in a way that <em>S-Town</em> could only hint at. It&rsquo;s frustrating to feel that there&rsquo;s more just outside the reach of the storyteller, and that certain aspects of the story aren&rsquo;t covered as thoroughly as they should because of the limitations of the medium.</p>

<p>The characters and situations in <em>S-Town</em> are rich, deep, and they possess many levels. They deserve the richness, depth, and nuance that only books can provide.</p>
