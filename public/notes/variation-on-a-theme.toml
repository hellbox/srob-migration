Iâ€™ve worn them once<br>
my wedding shoes<br>
dyed red, more and yes red<br>
the way a strike against<br>
the tip of a match ignites<br>
and pomegranate rubies<br>
stain a thousand secrets worth<br>
Adam did not fall for jewels<br>
but for the juice of a fruit<br>
like the crimson Fujis I harvest<br>
each fall from my backyard tree<br>
when rusty leaves layer the ground
