<li><p>Does your organization need diversity training? If you&rsquo;re an arts organization in Seattle, the answer is probably yes. This Saturday in the <a href="http://2100building.com/">2100 Building</a> at 1:30 p.m., two local artists with lots of experience in the topic are hosting a &ldquo;public discussion about the pros and cons of working with professionals, consultants, and hands-on-experts to facilitate an anti-racist work environment.&rdquo; Entry fees range from $5 to $20, though nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/838776766270685/?acontext=%7B%22action_history%22%3A%22[%7B%5C%22surface%5C%22%3A%5C%22messaging%5C%22%2C%5C%22mechanism%5C%22%3A%5C%22attachment%5C%22%2C%5C%22extra_data%5C%22%3A%7B%7D%7D]%22%7D">confirm for the event on Facebook</a>.</p></li>
