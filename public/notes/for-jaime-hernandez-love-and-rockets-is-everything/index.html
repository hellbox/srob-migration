<p><em>Love and Rockets</em> co-creator Jaime Hernandez is a guest at Emerald City Comic Con this weekend, but he can&rsquo;t visit Seattle without a visit to his lifelong publisher, Fantagraphics Books. This <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1326701757476176/">Saturday at 7 pm</a>, Hernandez will be signing books and talking with fans at a free event in the Fantagraphics Bookstore and Gallery in Georgetown to <a href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/fantastudiojaimehernandez/">celebrate the release of a deluxe artist edition portfolio highlighting his creative process as a cartoonist</a>.</p>

<p>Hernandez&rsquo;s latest <em>Love and Rockets</em> collection, <em>Angels and Magpies</em>, continues the story of the popular characters he&rsquo;s been writing and drawing since 1981, but it also brings something new to the equation. Hernandez spends an extended sequence in the book on a superhero adventure with all the trappings - spandex, capes, fistfights, creepy demons, powers, the works.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The superhero story came about because we had changed formats,&rdquo; Hernandez tells me over the phone. &ldquo;We changed the size of [<em>Love and Rockets</em>] and I needed to fill 50 pages in a year. I had never done it all at once, before,&rdquo; he said. The superhero comic was originally intended to be &ldquo;just a side project,&rdquo; he says, but he worked it into the larger <em>Love and Rockets</em> story.</p>

<p>Hernandez&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the story is apparent on every single page of the book. &ldquo;It kind of wrote itself,&rdquo; Hernandez says. &ldquo;I was having a lot of fun. I guess you could say it was kind of a new approach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I ask if Gary Groth - Fantagraphics Books&rsquo; publisher and an avowed hater of mainstream superhero comics - would have published these superhero strips back in the 1990s, when Groth was most avidly raging against the machine, Hernandez laughs. &ldquo;I think he would, yeah,&rdquo; he says. Groth, Hernandez says, has always given Hernandez and his brother Gilbert a wide berth in their <em>Love and Rockets</em> work. Groth &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t step on our toes that way. If we do something a little oddball and he doesn&rsquo;t like it, I just don&rsquo;t hear from him for a couple years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is Hernandez content to keep working on <em>Love and Rockets</em> comics? I bring up Peter Bagge, a contemporary of the Hernandez brothers who has found a successful and surprising second act as a biographer of important women in history. Does Hernandez have any books that he&rsquo;d like to work on outside of the world he&rsquo;s created?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I prefer to stay in my little universe and help the characters grow old,&rdquo; he tells me.  &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything I want to tackle, it usually will fit in there. I&rsquo;m getting older, you know, and I just want to see what happens with my characters. And so I concentrate on them as real people and try to figure out, &lsquo;okay, what are you going to be at 60?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hernandez says he&rsquo;s fully committed to his characters, but he still experiences a lot of doubt as an artist. &ldquo;Every issue I draw, I have to have a hate period in there where I can&rsquo;t get through it. I have to argue with myself: &lsquo;is this worth it? Is this worth everyone&rsquo;s time? Is this worth my time? Is this good art?&rsquo; And part of me is going, &lsquo;no it ain&rsquo;t, old man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the end, Hernandez says, &ldquo;I come to this compromise with the five people in my head and then I say, &lsquo;okay, it&rsquo;s good enough - or good enough for now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next time I&rsquo;ll get it right,&rdquo; he says.</p>
