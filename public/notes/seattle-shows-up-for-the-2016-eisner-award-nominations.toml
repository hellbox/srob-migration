The 2016 Eisner Award [nominations have been announced](http://www.comicsbeat.com/__trashed/) — the Eisners are basically the Oscars of comic books — and Seattle is well-represented this year. Fantagraphics Books is the most-nominated company of the year, with a whopping 17 nods. (One of Fantagraphics' most-nominated titles is *The Eternaut*, [which I reviewed here at the *Seattle Review of Books* back in December](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-sky-is-falling/).)

Other Seattle-area nominees include The Oatmeal's Matthew Inman, who was nominated for his strip "[It's Going to Be Okay](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/plane)," and G. Willow Wilson, who was nominated for Best Writer [for her work on *Ms. Marvel*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/15/thursday-comics-hangover-the-end-of-ms-marvel/). Other Eisner nominees that have been reviewed by the staff of *Seattle Review of Books* includes:

* [*Kaijumax*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/31/thursday-comics-hangover-kaijumax-loses-its-balance/), a series about giant monsters imprisoned on an island.
* The wonderful new series [*Paper Girls*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/05/thursday-comics-hangover-the-weird-dawn-light-of-paper-girls/) by Brian K. Vaughan and Cliff Chiang.
* [*Giant Days*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/22/thursday-comics-hangover-ants-and-giants-win-a-miserable-week/), a comedy series from Boom! about young women in college.
* [*Nimona*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/drawn-this-way/), a fantasy comic by Noelle Stevenson.
* And [*The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*](http://recode.net/2015/04/21/sydney-paduas-new-comic-proves-ada-lovelace-was-not-a-fake-geek-girl/), by Sydney Padua.

Congratulations to all the nominees, and here's to Seattle making a strong showing as the great comics town we all know it to be. It's great to hear, too, that this is [a record-breaking year for women](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/04/19/a-record-number-of-women-received-eisner-awards-nominations-full-list-here/) at the Eisners.
