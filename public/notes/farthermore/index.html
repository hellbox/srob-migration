<p>The child is no one. Her needs are<br>
met. She’s bringing flowers to an idea.</p>

<p>Of bees, there’s a hive the child tends &mdash;<br>
fresh picked flowers on a made mound of dirt<br>
packed in the shade of a dark green fire escape.</p>

<p>As she picks (and puts) I think of a singing &mdash;<br>
the voice itself a handrail up<br>
to an altar in the middle of a church which once<br>
with Olena I entered<br>
how many summers ago,<br>
where we crossed the hold between kinds</p>

<p>of light and sat ourselves<br>
like Protestants in an oiled wooden row.<br>
We could have been</p>

<p>in Rome, our pair the only audience<br>
in Santa Maria del Popolo, facing the facing <br>
Caravaggios. I wish &mdash; but the child is no one. Her needs are <br>
none that I know.</p>
