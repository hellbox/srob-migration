<p>I won&rsquo;t spoil any of <em>Blade Runner 2049</em> for you. Just trust me when I say you should go see it as quickly as possible, on as large a screen as possible. (I recommend <a href="https://www.cinerama.com/">going to Cinerama</a>, obviously.) The performances are roundly incredible, but Roger Deakins&rsquo;s cinematography runs away with the show. Deakins, whose photography made the generic Spielbergian thriller plot of <em>Minority Report</em> into a cultural touchstone, is doing the best work of his career with <em>2049</em>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad to report, also, that this isn&rsquo;t some dumbed-down franchise-builder of a sequel. It&rsquo;s very much in the tone of the original film, in design and sound and pacing. If you were worried about the possibility that <em>2049</em> would amount to a <em>Fast and the Furious</em> movie set in the <em>Blade Runner</em> world, you should rest assured that it&rsquo;s a close relative to the original. It is a noir film and a sci-fi film, and a film for adults.</p>

<p>But is <em>2049</em> in the spirit of Philip K. Dick? The first film, of course, was based on the Dick novel <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</em>, and it hewed very close to Dick&rsquo;s central themes of technological alienation and the blurred lines of identity and personhood in modern civlization.</p>

<p>The truth is, I&rsquo;m not sure if <em>2049</em> is a truly Dickian movie. The film does address some of the first film&rsquo;s themes of what makes a human, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem interested in those questions in the same way that Dick was. Instead, it moves on to other themes and topics. It has its own questions to consider.</p>

<p>But would it even be worthwhile or relevant for <em>2049</em> to address the questions raised in <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em> Perhaps now that we all carry thrumming electronic rectangles that contain all of our interests, hopes, and fears, we&rsquo;ve moved as a society past Philip K. Dick&rsquo;s concerns of what it means to be a person in an accelerated technological era.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; seems like a question our artists left behind in the hairy, self-investigatory late 1970s and early 1980s. Now, our art seems to be more interested in questions of purpose and intent, and <em>2049</em> definitely does some interesting work in those spaces. It&rsquo;s a movie that people will be pulling apart for months and years to come, and I hope that there will soon be a raucous and inclusive public conversation about where the film stands in the pantheon of Dick&rsquo;s fictional worlds.</p>
