<p>When I was a kid, I loved George R. R. Martin&rsquo;s superhero anthology fiction series Wild Cards.  It&rsquo;s hard to get superheroes right in prose, but Martin&rsquo;s dark and involved universe just felt perfect. (The comics adaptation of the books, as I recall, was terrible.) If you&rsquo;re going on vacation later this month and you like sci-fi anthologies, grab a couple Wild Cards volumes before you go.</p>

<p>Well, now that <em>Game of Thrones</em> has taken over the universe, <a href="http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/universal-cable-productions-nabs-the-rights-to-george-r-r-martins-wild-cards-series/123452">a <em>Wild Cards</em> TV series is in the works</a>. After watching the debacle that is <em>Suicide Squad</em> last week — seriously, they should show that movie in film editing classes to demonstrate how <em>not</em> to edit a film — I&rsquo;m feeling pretty burned out on live-action superheroes. But I think <em>Wild Cards</em> is a decent enough mix of realism, intelligence, and inventiveness to work on tv.</p>
