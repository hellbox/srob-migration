What's your favorite fair? Everybody thinks of the <a href="http://www.thefair.com/" title="Washington State Fair : TheFair.com">Washington State Fair</a> ("the Puyallup"), around our parts, but that one is so big and crowded. Just north, in Monroe, is the smaller, but no less exciting, <a href="https://www.evergreenfair.org" title="Evergreen State Fairgrounds, WA - Official Website | Official Website">Evergreen State Fair</a>, right at the Speedway, so you can watch drag races while eating your cotton candy. My personal favorite, since I spent a lot of time in Bellingham, is the <a href="http://nwwafair.com" title="Northwest Washington Fair &amp; Event Center">Northwest Washington Fair</a>, up in Lynden, Washington.
</p>

<p>What makes the fair so great? It&rsquo;s surely not the junk food, the queasy-making rides, or the big concerts (in Lynden, you can see Night Ranger, in Monroe, Joan Jett — she puts on a mean show — but at the Puyallup, you can see Modest Mouse, the Beach Boys, Earth, Wind, and Fire, just to name a few of the major headliners). It&rsquo;s a kind of homespun insanity of 4H farm kids, mixed with cowboys and functional western fetish-wear, mashed into a rock &lsquo;n roll carny factory, that always has a tinge of a Stephen King story. Like, something could go terribly wrong at any minute.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the barnfuls of ribboned swine, next door to hucksters selling the latest gadget in a small booth, their microphones broadcasting their prattle to the walkers-by. It&rsquo;s the dress horses, and at least in Lynden, the Clydesdales, all hitched in a train to an open-back wagon that they high-walk around the ring. It&rsquo;s the John Deere tractors out for sale, and the little area where the RV dealer sets up so you can walk through your mobile dream.</p>

<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s the rides. It&rsquo;s getting whipped around on a ride where half the seats are closed, and the whole thing is shored up on the grass by some old boards. It&rsquo;s wondering what must have happened for that handwritten sign that says &ldquo;no open toed shoes&rdquo; to be made and stuck up. It&rsquo;s the weird math trying to figure out how many ride tickets you&rsquo;ll need to do everything you want. Then, it&rsquo;s those blissful few moments being tossed around and given a thrill, before coming back down to your own two feet and a desire to eat more.</p>

<p>Every bit of food is big at the fair, and not as expensive as you might find at a year-round amusement park. If it&rsquo;s not deep fried, it could be, and if it couldn&rsquo;t be, somebody has surely tried. Ice cream sandwiches the size your head, and so many hamburgers you have to wonder if they have a butcher tent out back of the beef barn to keep them supplied.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the change in the air as the sun goes down, and the little kids go home to bed. The teenagers rule the midway, as the parents go off to watch some country music. It&rsquo;s the pubescent explosion of promise, that oversized stuffed animal roped high above the games that could be won but for trying, and that first stolen kiss, sweet with sno cone syrup still on the lip.</p>

<p>The state fairs are many things to many people, and maybe that&rsquo;s why I love them so much. I never feel like I belong, in truth, but I always feel like I&rsquo;m wandering through a thousand other stories, and getting to see so many parts of it. Makes it fun to think about what kind of things are happening there.</p>

<h5>Today's prompts</h5>

<ol>
<li><p>They stuck her on the kiddie roller coaster again. Taking tickets. Getting the little shits in the cars, every other seat broken and unsafe. But as the kids went around the boring little track, she was watching across the way, at the Thrill-O-Wheel, where her connection was running the show. She was starting to get a bit antsy. The delivery was supposed to happen an hour ago, and the little shits might just drive her to madness before the fix came in. That&rsquo;s when the princess stepped up with her tickets and demanded entrance to the car in front, one of the broken ones.</p></li>

<li><p>It was a dare. When the person you have a crush on is going on a stomach-turning ride, and your friends volunteer you to go with, you can&rsquo;t say no. And maybe you can hold in the milkshake and fries you just ate and not throw up on your crush, and maybe they will reach out to grab your hand, like in your most feverish dream. But neither of you look at each other as the bars come down. Only after it&rsquo;s too late and they say &ldquo;I really, really don&rsquo;t want to do this&rdquo; and you say &ldquo;oh god me neither&rdquo; do you notice how both sets of your friends are laughing out loud. You both were set up.</p></li>

<li><p>They got a shipment of three thousand units before the fair. Balance boards, of all the goddamn things. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the health angle. Good for aging, agility, strength, that kind of bullshit. I&rsquo;ll get banners printed up tonight,&rdquo; Mark said. Desi thought it was better than last year, hawking those stupid juicers, but how good are they gonna do next to the fidget spinner booth? Maybe Desi was getting to old for the game. Maybe</p></li>

<li><p>Nobody pays attention to the meet-cute of best friends. Unless it&rsquo;s a romantic thing, nobody talks about anniversaries, or years together. Friendships outlast the marriages, sometimes, go through the illnesses and children and everything together. But nobody talks about how special they are, not really. But one started that day, all because of two coincidences. First, being next to each other on the giant slide, and chatting on the way up. Then, second, finding out they were working in the same ice cream booth. The story has yet to unfold, but one thing is worth saying up front: this friendship will span their whole lives, and they will never be closer to another than they are to each other.</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be you,&rdquo; she said, leaning down and petting the side of her soon-to-be prize pig. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be you. I know it. You&rsquo;re gonna take blue.&rdquo; The pig, dappled with black and pink, leaned into the hand and snorted, turning its head, its wet snout glistening in the morning light. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the prettiest pig, the smartest pig, the best all around pig, and I know you&rsquo;re gonna win.&rdquo; The pig looked up at her, seemed to cock an eyebrow, as if waiting for the <em>but</em> &hellip; Then it came: &ldquo;just so long, that is, as you don&rsquo;t let them know you can talk.&rdquo;</p></li>
