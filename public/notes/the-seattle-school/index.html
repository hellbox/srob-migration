<p>We celebrated our distance from New York,<br>
high-fived each other as our words</p>

<p>debuted in <em>Open Books</em> and <em>Floating Bridge</em>,</p>

<p><em>Elliott Bay</em>, and the daze of <em>The Typing Explosion</em>.<br>
That’s what they will call us you predicted</p>

<p>as we stood on the edge of Summit Avenue</p>

<p>near Broadway, <em>The Seattle School</em>, while the newfangled<br>
streetlight wandered in and out of power.</p>

<p>We were younger then, with little idea</p>

<p>of poetry schools, just a sense of the work we revered:<br>
my Bishop to your Rilke and Celan.</p>

<p>No herons on our pages, no water views.</p>

<p>Our lives as the poets barely minted,<br>
we attempted daily practice, failed</p>

<p>at monastic prayer, and acquired several cats.</p>

<p>We were nobodies inhabiting blue basements<br>
until step by step our bright lives</p>

<p>extended upwards and soon our books</p>

<p>caught between us, some breadcrumbs of awards.<br>
Tonight I want to return to that streetlight—</p>

<p>the long night’s amble into iambs<br>
and hold tight to our glitter of ambitions—</p>

<p>irregular as the blinking bulb.</p>
