<p><a href="http://www.spl.org/audiences/adults/seattle-reads">This news</a> got buried in the holiday onslaught, and it deserves room to breathe: The 2018 Seattle Reads selection is Yaa Gyasi&rsquo;s novel <em>Homegoing</em>.</p>

<p>Seattle Reads is the Seattle Public Library program formerly known as If All Seattle Read the Same Book. Basically, the library gets a ton of copies of the book and hosts the selection&rsquo;s author in library branches around the city. It&rsquo;s an attempt to focus conversation and encourage civic discourse around the topic of a single novel.</p>

<p><em>Homegoing</em> — a novel about two sisters born in eighteenth-century Ghana who live completely opposite lives — is a sensational choice, and a higher-profile selection than some of the recent Seattle Reads selections. The book has won awards from PEN and the National Book Critics Circle, and it was featured on many best-of-the-year lists. <a href="http://www.spl.org/audiences/adults/seattle-reads">SPL says</a> the book &ldquo;illuminates slavery&rsquo;s troubled legacy both for those who were taken and those who stayed-and shows how the memory of captivity has been inscribed on the soul of our nation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Copies of <em>Homegoing</em> and related book club materials will be available through Seattle Public Library in the middle of February. Gyasi will visit Seattle in May for a number of personal appearances. Get started on the book now so you can be a part of the conversation this spring.</p>
