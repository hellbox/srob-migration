If you&rsquo;re interested in creative uses of the comics format, or in innovative literary fiction, this week&rsquo;s sponsor sample is a must-see. Kevin Marshall&rsquo;s <em>Not Really an Emotion</em> walks the border between reality and dream, transforming the familiar comic book conventions (panels, speech bubbles) into something strange and new. The storyline of <em>Not Really an Emotion</em> is appropriately dreamlike: a young woman, meditating, hears music she can&rsquo;t forget, and seeks to recreate it through means both natural and fantastic. We can&rsquo;t do it justice here; spend just a few minutes with it <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">on our sponsorship page</a>, and you&rsquo;ll be hooked.</p>
