This Friday is your last chance to apply for the [Jack Straw Writers Program](http://jackstraw.org/programs/asp/2016/WP2016_application.shtml), which this year is being curated by awesome Seattle poet and novelist Karen Finneyfrock. It's a great opportunity for writers at the beginning of their career:

<blockquote>Established and emerging artists working in any discipline or genre may apply to any one of the residency programs offered. Artists living outside of the Puget Sound region may apply, but should be aware that expenses for travel, lodging, etc. are not included in the award. Literary groups applying to the Writers Program are limited to three persons.</blockquote>

Deadlines are also closing this Friday for the [Jack Straw Artist Support Program](http://jackstraw.org/programs/asp/2016/ASP2016_application.shtml), which is a great resource for writers who need help professionally recording their own work. Past recipients of this award include Seattle writers Shin Yu Pai, Anna Balint, Imani Sims, and Storme Webber.

Jack Straw is an amazing resource for emerging and established writers in Seattle. It teaches writers to present and preserve their work in exciting ways, and it also advocates tirelessly for those writers through readings and events and anthologies. If you're a writer in Seattle and you haven't applied for a Jack Straw program, you're missing a huge opportunity.
