<p class="noindent">
Look, friends, this week it's really simple: not knowing what's coming with our country, backing an erotic queer story of interracial vampire-human romance seems downright political. I want publishers like Iron Circus (run by the kickass C. Spike Trotman, who [flipped off the gatekeepers of the comics world, and built a thriving publishing house her own way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CojfpoRZXOk)) to have as much money as possible on hand for whatever may come under this coming administration. 
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
First, Iron Circus puts out extremely high quality smut, filled with characters you'll love and stories that compel you to turn every page. There's a lot of sex, too, and romance. This isn't your old alt-press boner-fest comix from the sweaty back room for the horny fanboys; this is complex, real relationships in fantastical settings drawn by well-paid artists, written by amazing writers, with a focus on diversity of all kinds. It's the real deal.
</p>

<p>Iron Spike does a lot of Kickstarters (this is number ten!). They know what they&rsquo;re doing, and they know how to deliver quality goods. Back this, give them some money, and let&rsquo;s get their coffers stuffed to the gills. Maybe they won&rsquo;t need lawyers in the upcoming administration, but being able to afford some will do wonders.</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    They're 212% funded. They don't need us, we need them.

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
