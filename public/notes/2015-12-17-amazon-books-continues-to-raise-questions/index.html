        <p>Shelf Awareness, which broke the news about Amazon Books, <a href="http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2656#m30853">continues to raise questions</a> about the brick-and-mortar outpost of Amazon.com:</p>

<blockquote>Is Amazon Books getting its stock from Amazon.com, which gets extra terms unavailable to most bricks-and-mortar retailers? Are books being bought non-returnable by Amazon.com but being returned by Amazon Books to Amazon.com? How, if at all, is a distinction made between the two businesses--and how will that be handled at meetings in which the bookstore buyers participate?</blockquote>

<p>This is an important distinction to make: publishers sell books to physical retailers under very different terms — discounts, returnability, etc. — than they do with online booksellers. Publishers would likely be very upset if they learned that Amazon Books is selling books that were sold to Amazon.com.</p>
