<p>Burglars stole nearly a thousand dollars from the delightful Couth Buzzard Books on Greenwood Ave over the weekend, <a href="http://www.phinneywood.com/2015/11/02/burglars-break-into-couth-buzzard-books-steal-950/">reports Phinneywood.com</a>. That&rsquo;s a lot of money, especially for a store that&rsquo;s still a month away from the holiday rush.

<blockquote>Some of you have asked how you can help. Well, come on by and say hello, grab a great drink, some food and check out our great selection of new and used books.</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s wonderful advice. Maybe plan a little trip to the Couth Buzzard this weekend? If you buy one or two books, that would go a long way toward recouping their losses.</p>
