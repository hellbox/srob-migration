<p><h5><strong>Friday, October 6: <em>From Here to Eternity</em> Reading</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Caitlin Doughty is a mortician whose new book, <em>From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death</em>, “travels the world [from Bolivia to Japan to Indonesia] to discover how other cultures care for their dead.” Tonight, she’s joined by Seattle poet Sonya Vatomsky in an onstage conversation. She goes to Bolivia to see cigarette-smoking, wish-granting human skulls; to Japan to watch relatives of the deceased use chopsticks to pluck their loved ones’ bones from cremation ashes; to Indonesia to watch a man dress his grandfather’s mummified body. </p></p>
