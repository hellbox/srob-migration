<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

<p><strong>I can&rsquo;t remember if my anger and frustration with Amazon began when I heard about <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sadistic-amazon-treated-book-sellers-the-way-a-cheetah-would-pursue-a-sickly-gazelle-2013-10">the &ldquo;gazelle&rdquo; project</a>, or when I heard about their <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/a-midget-among-giants/Content?oid=567816">total lack of philanthropic investment</a> in our city, or what, but by the time <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/its-time-to-turn-your-back-on-amazon/Content?oid=19708679">the Hachette e-book price wars</a> started up, my rage had reached a boiling point, and with the opening of their <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/04/the-internet-cant-stop-talking-about-amazon-books/">stupid bookstore</a>, I am just seething. I hate what they&rsquo;ve done to books and book publishing and everything I hold dear as a writer, editor, and reader. So my question is: how best to channel my rage? I already stopped shopping there, and I think my friends and family are honestly pretty sick of my virtual and in-person ranting on the subject. I need some new ideas for creative or constructive outlets for my Amazon hatred. Help!</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Marybeth,</p>

<p>I understand your feelings of impotence and frustration. It would be melodramatic to say that Amazon ruined the publishing industry, the book selling industry, or Seattle. However, it&rsquo;s fair to say that Amazon waited until publishers, booksellers, and the city of Seattle as a whole was sleeping, took a big smelly dump on their chests and said, &ldquo;you look like shit but that&rsquo;s not my problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A better advice columnist might tell you to take the high road and ignore their crappy business dealings but I&rsquo;m afraid of heights so the high road is never an option for me. So what do you do? I suggest working to change the only item on your above list that you have a kitten&rsquo;s chance in hell of influencing: Amazon&rsquo;s philanthropic giving, which is laughable. It amazes me that with 24,000 employees in Washington state alone, and many of them Seattleites, those employees aren&rsquo;t demanding better from their employer. Instead of instigating poster wars that attempt to shame Amazon tech bros for moving to Seattle and &ldquo;ruining&rdquo; neighborhoods, why aren&rsquo;t Seattleites banding together to demand Amazon be a better philanthropic presence in the city that has contributed greatly to its success?</p>

<p>There are enough readers, writers, booksellers, sympathetic Amazon employees, and liberals in Seattle to put pressure on that company to change its corporate structure in one small way. How to accomplish that exactly, I can&rsquo;t say. Someone who&rsquo;s well versed in organizing, rather than telling alcoholic librarians what to do every Friday, should come up with a plan. (The only protest I can claim participation in took place last Christmas when, after a bathtub&rsquo;s worth of hot buttered rums and gin! Gin! Gin! my liver went on strike.)</p>

<p>Affecting change in that way, I believe, would make a satisfying difference.</p>

<p>(If it doesn&rsquo;t, you could always try taking a dump in front of their store. That also makes a satisfying difference.)</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
