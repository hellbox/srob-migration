<p>Our thanks to Floating Bridge Press for their sponsorship this week. They&rsquo;re showing off 2015 chapbook award winner Michael Schmeltzer, and his winning work <em>Elegy/Elk River</em>. The titular poem is <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">available to read on our sponsors page</a>, and it is an amazing piece of work. His accolades are well deserved.</p>

<p>The 2016 Chapbook Competition is now accepting entries. The winner will be joining an impressive <a href="http://www.floatingbridgepress.org/chapbook/" title="Chapbooks | Floating Bridge Press">line of poets</a> going back twenty years. There&rsquo;s more information on the <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">sponsor page</a>, but if you&rsquo;re a poet looking for opportunities to submit your work, you should certainly pay attention here. You&rsquo;d walk away with a cash prize, and publication of your chapbook. Be sure to check it out.</p>
