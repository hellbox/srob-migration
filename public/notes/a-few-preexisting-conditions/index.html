<p>We drank too much.<br>
Stayed up too late<br>
watching elephants disappear.<br>
The beer was flat. The ice<br>
receded. The moon<br>
tracked its footprints into the house.<br>
Bases loaded, the batter struck out looking.<br>
The kicker shanked the field goal wide<br>
to the right. The wide receiver took a knee.<br>
The drone strike found its target.<br>
The drone strike missed its target.<br>
The drone strike turned the village to dust.<br>
We stood in line for hours<br>
waiting to vote.<br>
We stood in line for hours<br>
to procure a gallon of gas.<br>
The hurricane struck out looking.<br>
The hurricane stripped our limbless roofs.<br>
The car swerved into oncoming traffic.<br>
Traffic thickened in our veins.<br>
The DNA test came back negative.<br>
The DNA test came back positive.<br>
The father never came back.<br>
The father started smoking again<br>
after the heart attack.<br>
We ate too much red meat.<br>
We ate too much corn syrup.<br>
Our vote wasn’t counted after all.<br>
Our vote was packed into safe districts.<br>
We lost track of the days<br>
we didn’t have to work overtime<br>
to make rent. The rent woke up.<br>
The rent went up in smoke.<br>
We ignored the lump in the lymph node.<br>
Doctors hit the lymph node hard.<br>
Not our doctors. Too expensive.<br>
Someone brought us a pot pie instead.<br>
The dog ate it. The printer jammed.<br>
Dandelions took over the yard.<br>
Smoke took over the sky.<br>
We drank too much. The world was flat.<br>
Poachers took out the last rhino.<br>
Few understood the news.</p>
