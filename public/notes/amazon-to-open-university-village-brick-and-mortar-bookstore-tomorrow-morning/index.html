<p>Looks like Amazon gave the <em>Seattle Times</em> the exclusive. <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-opens-first-bricks-and-mortar-bookstore-at-u-village/">Jay Greene reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>At 9:30 Tuesday morning, the online retail giant will open will open [sic] its first-ever brick-and-mortar retail store in its 20-year life in University Village.</p>

<p>The store, called Amazon Books, looks a lot like bookstores that populate malls across the country. Its wood shelves are stocked with 5,000 to 6,000 titles, best-sellers as well as Amazon.com customer favorites.</p></blockquote>

<p>We will of course go and investigate Amazon Books and report back soon. But in terms of quick takes: <strong>that&rsquo;s not a lot of titles</strong> for a bookstore to carry. Elliott Bay Book Company, for example, <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/node/about">has 150,000 titles</a>.</p>
