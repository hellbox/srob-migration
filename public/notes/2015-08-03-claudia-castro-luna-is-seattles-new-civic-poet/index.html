        <p>The Office of Arts &amp; Culture&rsquo;s Arts Beat blog <a href="http://artbeat.seattle.gov/2015/08/03/mayor-announces-claudia-castro-luna-as-seattles-first-civic-poet/">just announced</a> the name of Seattle&rsquo;s new Civic Poet. What&rsquo;s a Civic Poet, you ask? OAC explains that the new role &ldquo;serves as an ambassador for Seattle’s rich literary landscape and represents the city’s diverse cultural community,&rdquo; usually in the form of public appearances and workshops. It&rsquo;s a two-year appointment, and it pays $10,000. (Hooray for paying writers for their work!) Our newest Civic Poet is Claudia Castro Luna. OAC explains:</p>

<blockquote>Luna was born in El Salvador and came to the U.S. as a young teenager fleeing civil war. Since then she has completed a Master of Arts in Urban Planning, a teaching degree, and a Master of Fine Arts in poetry.

Luna is a K-12 certified teacher with a passion for arts education and teaching immigrants. In 2012, she earned a Master of Fine Arts in poetry from Mills College.</blockquote>

<p><strong>UPDATE 4:49 PM</strong>: <a href="http://kuow.org/post/meet-seattles-first-civic-poet-claudia-castro-luna">Ross Reynolds interviewed Claudia Castro Luna today on <em>The Record</em></a>. Listen all the way to the end of the interview, where she discusses setting up a &ldquo;poetic grid&rdquo; that stretches across Seattle. We like her already.</p>
