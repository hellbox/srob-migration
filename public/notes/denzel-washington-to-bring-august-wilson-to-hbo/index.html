<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://deadline.com/2015/09/denzel-washington-hbo-august-wilson-1201533153/">Denzel Washington announced</a> that he&rsquo;s going to produce adaptations of all ten plays in Seattle playwright August Wilson&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Wilson#The_Pittsburgh_Cycle">Pittsburgh Cycle</a> for HBO over the next ten years. This is a hugely ambitious project, and we look forward to Wilson staying at the top of the cultural conversation for another decade because of it.</p>
