<p>Chaim Gartenberg <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/19/13680564/recomendmeabook-book-recommendation-website-first-page">at The Verge</a> writes about the really neat idea behind <a href="http://www.recommendmeabook.com/">Recommendmeabook.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Designed by developer Givi Phirtskhalava, the site presents you with the first page of a novel as a blank, standalone item without title, author, or cover, allowing you to experience the beginning of a book without coloring it with any preconceived ideas.</blockquote>

<p>You just read the first page and if you like it, you push a button to reveal the title and author. If you don&rsquo;t like it, you hit the &ldquo;Next Book&rdquo; button. Simple. Unfortunately, the site only provides links to Amazon to buy the books, but you know to buy the books from your local independent bookstores instead, right? Right. <a href="http://www.recommendmeabook.com/">Go browse for a while</a>.</p>
