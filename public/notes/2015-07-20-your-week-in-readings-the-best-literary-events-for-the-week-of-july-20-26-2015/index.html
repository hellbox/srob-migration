        <p><strong>Monday</strong>: The monthly science discussion series Nerd Nite Seattle hosts a lecture titled “Slimers and Submersibles” tonight at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1618575958400972/">LUCIDLounge</a>. Hilary Hayford discusses using radio to track small marine animals and Tim Dwyer discusses using remote-controlled giant robots to investigate the ocean. But there’s also a special guest appearance at this Nerd Nite: a special bonus &ldquo;live Q&amp;A with real-life researchers currently at sea on a research mission!” Why would you go anywhere else tonight?</p>

<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1437171247429/images.jpg" alt="" /></p><strong>Tuesday</strong>: The Elliott Bay Sci-fi and Fantasy Book Group is discussing Philip K. Dick’s <em>The Man in the High Castle</em> tonight at 6:30. It’s free and you don’t have to have bought the book at Elliott Bay in order to participate, although you get bonus points if you do. This is one of Dick’s best-loved books — though, frankly, I found it a little disappointing, given that he died before he could finish the story he started in this book — and it’s also a popular television show. Please only show up if you read the book, though. People don’t come to book groups to talk with people who only watch TV.</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday</strong>: Author John Colasacco has a new book called <em>Antigolf</em> coming out from a publisher with the delightful name of Civil Coping Mechanisms. Tonight, he’s celebrating at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1414244088904029/">Vermillion Art Gallery and Bar</a> with delightful local poet Sarah Galvin and APRIL Festival cofounder Willie Fitzgerald, as well as with a Portland author named James Gendron, who is the author of a book titled <em>Sexual Boat</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday</strong>: Let’s be clear that <em>Book Lust</em> Nancy Pearl is a local treasure. I’m not as enamored with Steve Scher, who can be a very bad interviewer. But Scher and Pearl together have an easy rapport, especially when they nerd out on books. Town Hall is hosting a live taping of Pearl and Scher’s podcast, “That Stack of Books,” with a pair of special guests tonight at 7:30. It’s $5.</p>

<p><strong>Friday</strong>: Geffrey Davis is a poet who was born here (hooray!) and then moved to Pennsylvania (let’s not hold that against him). He’s a Cave Canem fellow, which is a sign of quality in a poet. (You should learn <a href="http://www.cavecanempoets.org/">what Cave Canem is</a>, if you’re unfamliar.) He’ll be reading from his new collection, <em>Revising the Storm</em>, at University Book Store tonight at 7 pm.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday</strong>: James B. Moore reads from his poetry collection <em>Spirit Unchained: The Autobiography of a Soul: Collected Poems 1967-2014</em> at Ravenna Third Place Books at 7 pm. That’s maybe one too many colons for a title to bear, but how often do you get to hear a poet reflect on four whole decades in the business?</p>

<p><strong>Sunday</strong>: No events that I could find. Go sit in the sun and re-read a book that you were so-so on the first time. Maybe you’ll find something new to love.</p>
