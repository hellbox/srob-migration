<p>For my thirtieth portrait for Portrait Gallery, I picked Seattle&rsquo;s own Lindy West. She has been everywhere lately: we <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/go-west-young-woman/">reviewed her book</a>, and Paul did <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/05/18/talking-with-lindy-west-about-fantasy-novels-deadlines-and-why-seattle-is-her-home/">this amazing interview with her</a>. She was at Town Hall last night, but if you missed it, you can still catch her tonight at <a href="http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/lindy-west-shrill-notes-loud-woman">Third Place Books in Lake Forest Park</a> before she&rsquo;s off to events around the country and in the UK.</p>
