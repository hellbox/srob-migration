<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Every once in a while I’ll visit someone’s house and see that they have a book, or a basket full of books, on the back of their toilet. I guess this is supposed to be hospitable or something, but all I can think about is how poo-encrusted those books must be.**</p>

<p><strong>I’m tempted to steal one of the books from a friend’s house during a party, put it under a microscope, and then mail a photograph of the fecal matter particles to my friends anonymously. But that would be too passive-aggressive, even for Seattle.</strong></p>

<p><strong>But it <em>is</em> disgusting, right?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Colin, First Hill</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Colin,</p>
 

<p class="noindent">Please don't stop with one book. Also take samples of your host's toothbrush, decorative soaps, air plants, privacy blinds – everything in the bathroom that isn't nailed down. And don't stop with one friend – repeat this process at multiple friends' homes. Then, in the name of fairness, I need you to stare straight into the brown eye of the beast and fecal test yourself, Colin – hands, neck, lips, fleshy pad of the buttocks. This will add credibility to what those in the unscientific community might call your “pervert games.”</p> 

<p>And you&rsquo;re right: Mailing your findings is passive aggressive ­– and no fun! You want to be present, watching your friends&rsquo; faces as they realize how you&rsquo;ve chosen to amuse yourself while an invited guest in their homes. Here is what you do to deliver those results with style: Host a Halloween party. Dress up as a proctologist. Hand deliver results to your guests, in ascending order of least- to most fecally. To offset the creepiness of your actions, give out full body condoms, DIY fecal testing kits and jars of artisanal bleach as prizes.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
