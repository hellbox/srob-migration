<blockquote>Lucia Perillo, a poet known for her sense of humor and her writing about living with multiple sclerosis, died on Oct. 16 at the age of 58 in Olympia, Wash., her publisher Copper Canyon Press confirms. Her most recent book, “Time Will Clean the Carcass Bones,” was published in February.</blockquote>

<p>Perillo was a MacArthur &ldquo;Genius&rdquo; Fellowship winner, her work was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize, and she was no stranger to the Seattle literary scene. If you haven&rsquo;t read her before, I&rsquo;d recommend &ldquo;<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/53123">Found Object</a>,&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s a great summation of her work: bawdy, observational, rooted in her perspective but generous and big-hearted and curious at the same time. I hope someone in Seattle will host a reading to celebrate Perillo&rsquo;s life; if this happens, I&rsquo;ll let you know.</p>
