She was perfect pitcher,<br>
Cooled glass and ice center,<br>
Crystal all her own bounty:

Solid hammer, extended bat broken<br>
Cam, when is delicate fist<br>
Worth more than peacock tailed<br>

Beauty fanned against face?

She is not safe.<br>
No one is safe<br>
From the break.

Her grandmother was a witchdoctor<br>
seafoam green eyes and muddy skin<br>
the earth shook when she spoke

islands out of the sea, a place called home.

She is not safe.<br>
No one is safe<br>
From the break.

The sun perched between her thighs<br>
A gown of silk and spit sways against<br>
The winds exhale, she asks the sky

To return her purple labia in exchange<br>
For the low hum she remembers rattled<br>
At moon once the sun burned out, but now

All she can hear is the whir and click of<br>
Her unhinged ribs stringing themselves back <br>
Together in the shape of an open mouth: 

she will devour each star until rendered black.

She is not safe.<br>
No one is safe <br>
From the break.

Her daughter wears a crown around her neck<br>
one lone dove in the palm of her hand<br>
she names it after her father's fallen eyelash.

A bundle of sage burns at her feet<br>
smoke twists towards her gathered ten,<br>
she stops listening to her mother chewing heat

long enough to catch the birds last breath.<br>
A copper leash patterned after still<br>
heart of her grandmother’s dust swings 

in mimic of smoke, proven ancestry.

She is still not safe.<br>
We are still not safe<br>
From the ache.                          

We form ourselves indigo diamonds<br>
Anyway.
