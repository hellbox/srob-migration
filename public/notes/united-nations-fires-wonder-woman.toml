Heidi MacDonald at [the indispensible comics news blog The Beat](http://www.comicsbeat.com/wonder-womans-un-ambassador-gig-is-over-following-petition/) reports on a petition to unseat Wonder Woman as an honorary ambassador at the United Nations. [The petition](http://www.thepetitionsite.com/741/288/432/reconsider-the-choice-of-honorary-ambassador-for-the-empowerment-of-women-and-girls/) blasts Wonder Woman's "overtly sexualized image" for "not [being] culturally encompassing or sensitive." It seems that the petition was successful — Wonder Woman is no longer considered to be a UN ambassador, though it's unclear how any fictional character can serve as an ambassador in the first place.

One issue the petition did not cite that seems relevant: it's highly squicky that the United Nation decided to privilege a corporate intellectual property with this kind of platform. MacDonald says that DC Comics had plans for the ambassadorship leading up to the launch of the *Wonder Woman* film next year. I'm all for Wonder Woman as a symbol — the fact that she was on the cover of the first issue of *Ms. Magazine* was a huge moment in feminist pop cultural history — but there's a difference between celebrating a superhero's folk status and promoting brand awareness for a multinational entertainment conglomerate. The idea of an international leadership role for women serving as synergy for a blockbuster movie is more than a little distasteful.
