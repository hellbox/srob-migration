<p>This is not the first time <a href="http://deadline.com/2016/08/barnes-noble-fires-ceo-ronald-boire-not-good-fit-1201804473/">this has happened</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Barnes & Noble just unceremoniously ousted Ronald Boire as CEO, saying that the board has deemed him “not a good fit for the organization and that it was in the best interests of all parties for him to leave the Company.”</blockquote>

<p>Boire was at the top of the chain book retailer for less than a year. This puts longtime Barnes &amp; Noble leader Leonard Riggio back in charge of the chain that he founded in 1965 and has led, on-and-off, ever since. Riggio was set to retire next month, which makes him yet another victim of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retirony">retirony</a>.</p>

<p>Will Barnes &amp; Noble ever find someone to lead it into the future? Or will Riggio have to permanently postpone his retirement in order to keep the retailer on life support? Barnes &amp; Noble&rsquo;s demise would create a depressing number of brick-and-mortar &ldquo;bookstore deserts&rdquo; in rural and suburban parts of America; the cultural stakes are way too high. At this point, even most independent booksellers I know are cheering on Barnes &amp; Noble&rsquo;s continuing survival. Let&rsquo;s hope they figure it out.</p>
