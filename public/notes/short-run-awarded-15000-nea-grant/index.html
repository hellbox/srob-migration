<p>Here&rsquo;s some good news on a downright gloomy day. We just got word from the good folks at <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/short-run-for-the-long-haul/">Short Run Comix and Arts Festival</a> that the National Endowment for the Arts awarded them a grant for their 2016 festival. (It&rsquo;s been <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/08/anca-szil%C3%A1gyi-wins-the-first-gar-lasalle-storyteller-award/">a good couple days for Seattle&rsquo;s standing in arts awards</a>.) A quick search of <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arts.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2FFall_2015_State_grant_list.pdf">the paperwork</a> reveals that Short Run was awarded <strong>$15,000</strong> by the NEA. Other local winners include SIFF, the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, the Seattle Opera, and, on the literary side of things, Town Hall Seattle, which also picked up $15,000. Congratulations to all the winners, but especially congratulations to Short Run, which has never recieved a grant this large before. We can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do with all that sweet, sweet NEA cash.</p>
