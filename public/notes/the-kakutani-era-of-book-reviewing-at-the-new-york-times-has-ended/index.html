<blockquote>*Vanity Fair* has learned that Michiko Kakutani, The *New York Times* chief book reviewer and Pulitzer Prize winner, who has been, by a wide margin, the most powerful book critic in the English-speaking world, is stepping down. Her final review, on the debut novel by Nigerian author Ayobami Adebayo, was published on Tuesday.</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ll likely have more thoughts on this at a later date, but here&rsquo;s my first impression: even people who don&rsquo;t typically read book reviews in the <em>New York Times</em> — here, I raise my hand meekly — have to acknowledge that this is a big deal for American literature. Kakutani is the closest thing to a household name that the book reviewing world has. The next person to take her position will enjoy a tremendous opportunity to represent literary criticism to the general public. Hopefully, the next editor will lead book reviewing into the 21st century with creativity and enthusiasm.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 10:17 AM</strong>: This post has been updated because I believed some idiot on Twitter about Kakutani&rsquo;s replacement. Sorry about that. I&rsquo;ll try not to believe Twitter randos without double-sourcing next time. No replacement for Kakutani has been named, though critic <a href="https://twitter.com/parul_sehgal">Parul Seghal</a> has been <a href="http://www.nytco.com/michiko-kakutani-steps-down-as-chief-book-critic-parul-sehgal-named-book-critic/">elevated from <em>NYT Book Review</em> senior editor to a critic position</a> at the daily <em>Times</em>.</p>
