<li><p>We first <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/07/20/tacoma-is-very-close-to-finally-honoring-dune-author-frank-herbert-with-a-park/">told you about this seven months ago</a>, and now it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article199941624.html">officially a reality</a>: Tacoma has named a new park after the life and works of sci-fi author Frank Herbert. &ldquo;Dune Peninsula at Point Defiance Park&rdquo; is an 11-acre park featuring &ldquo;Frank Herbert Trail.&rdquo; Tacoma Metro Parks commissioner Erik Hanberg told the <em>News Tribune</em> that Herbert&rsquo;s “experiences in Tacoma shaped his appreciation for the delicate balance of nature, so it feels right to attach his name to a park that reclaims toxic land.” The park is set to open by late summer or fall. We&rsquo;ll let you know when it opens, and we&rsquo;ll take a field trip down to check it out.</p></li>

The book will soon be available in libraries and schools around the nation.</p></li>
