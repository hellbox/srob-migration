Dee Lockett at [Vulture](http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/meyer-rewrote-twilight-with-different-genders.html?mid=twitter_vulture#) says: 

<blockquote>Ten years after Edward Cullen and Bella Swan made vampires virtually inescapable, Stephenie Meyer is back to turn your tweens once again. In celebration of the first book's anniversary, Meyer has rewritten *Twilight* with the genders of the saga's star-crossed lovers reversed. Meet Beau and Edythe, main characters of the newly feminist reading of the series now dubbed *Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined*, out today. In this version, Bella is Beau, a teen boy who moves to Forks, Washington, and finds himself enamored with the vampire Edythe, the female version of Edward. Meyer explained on *Good Morning America* that the idea behind the new 442-page book was to put to rest repeated criticism of the original series that it reduced Bella to a "damsel in distress" trope.</blockquote>

Okay.
