<p>keep me safe<br>
keep me safe from those who want to cut<br>
keep me safe from those who want to cut me<br>
keep me safe from those who want to cut me open<br>
keep me safe from those who want to cut me open me and crawl inside</p>

<p>keep me safe from me<br>
keep me safe from my own<br>
keep me safe from my own hand<br>
keep me safe from my own hand if it is me holding the knife<br>
keep me safe from my own hand it it is me holding the knife</p>
