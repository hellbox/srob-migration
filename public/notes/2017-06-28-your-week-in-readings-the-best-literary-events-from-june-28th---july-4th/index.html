        <p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday June 28th: Poetic Grid**</h5></p> 
For the last two years, Claudia Castro Luna has made Seattle proud as our Civic Poet, representing Seattle’s many experiences through poetry.

Tonight, she debuts the Poetic Grid, a fantastic collaborative poetry map of Seattle.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Saturday July 1st: <em>The Fateful Fourth</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Washington historian Russel Holter discusses “the notorious 1900 trolley accident” that helped shape the city of Tacoma for a whole century. It’s an account of a doomed 4th of July celebration that, on our first 4th of July under President Trump, might be even more resonant than ever.
<em>University Book Store Tacoma, 1754 Pacific Ave., (253) 692-4300, <a href="http://u.bookstore.edu">http://u.bookstore.edu</a>, 2 p.m. All ages. Free.</em></p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Sunday July 2nd: Reading with Rover</strong></h5></p>
Fun fact: if you know a child who is having trouble learning how to read, have them practice reading to dogs. And if you don’t have any dogs in your life, bring them to this event, which features trained therapy dogs just waiting for kids to read to them.
<em>University Book Store Mill Creek, 15311 Main St., 425-385-3530. <a href="http://ubookstore.com">http://ubookstore.com</a>. Free. All ages. 11:30 a.m. </em></p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Monday July 3rd: Works in Progress</strong></h5></p>
One of Seattle’s most venerable open mic nights continues in a special pre-Independence Day edition. Bring your non-fiction or fiction or patriotic pantoum and share it with an eclectic room of regulars and newbies and aspiring writers. Press materials warn that “Some content not suitable for children or small animals.”
*Hugo House, 1021 Columbia St., 322-7030, <a href="http://hugohouse.org">http://hugohouse.org</a>. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. * </p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Tuesday July 4th: Democracy Slam</strong></h5></p>
What better way to celebrate the 4th of July than with a poetry slam? Think of today’s Democracy Slam as a celebration of your constitutional right to celebrate the freedom of speech, with booze and prizes. It’s a hell of a lot more fun than getting drunk and blowing a thumb off with some fireworks.
<em>Re-Bar, 1114 Howell St., <a href="http://rebarseattle.com">http://rebarseattle.com</a>. $5. 21+. 7 p.m</em></p>
