The *Antioch Review* published [a horrifying transphobic essay](http://review.antiochcollege.org/sacred-androgen-transgender-debate-daniel-harris) in its Winter 2016 issue. They issued [a very bad apology](http://review.antiochcollege.org/may-5-2016-announcement) today. You should read [this open letter of protest](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qMjAMIKEw7PffcWENMS9huV8upazWzzyboyp2NEh9Ow/viewform) to *Antioch*, and [sign it](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qMjAMIKEw7PffcWENMS9huV8upazWzzyboyp2NEh9Ow/viewform) if you agree.
