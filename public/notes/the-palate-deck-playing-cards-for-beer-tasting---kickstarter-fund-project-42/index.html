<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Something a little different today. A little less literary than our normal Kickstarter, but no less creative. For those of you who are drinkers, and more specifically, those of you who are beer aficionados, this week's project is for you. 
</p>

<p>
    Dave Shea is a designer and creator in Vancouver, BC. If you work on the web, and design using CSS, no doubt you've heard of the wildly influential [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com). 
</p>

<p>
    He's also a Certified Cicerone® and BJCP-Certified Beer Judge, and the co-founder of Vancouver's [Farmhouse Fest Saison](http://farmhousefest.com/). Dude knows his beer, and he wanted to design a way to talk about beer when tasting — to give people a vocabulary, whether they are new or old hands, at discerning the varied experiences of imbibing brew. 
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Well, if you're into beer, it's a gimme. I played a demo of the cards at XOXO fest in Portland last month, and they're really fun, and beautifully designed. If you like talking about beer, this is going to be a great conversation piece to have with you at the pub. If you're not sure how to talk about beer, this is a great educational tool. 
</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    18% there and 27 days to go. If this is the kind of thing that sparks your attention, grab one now!
