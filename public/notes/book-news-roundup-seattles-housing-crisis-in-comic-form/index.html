<li><p>Mary Ann Gwinn <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/seward-park-meet-your-new-bookstore/">at the <em>Seattle Times</em> offers an in-depth preview</a> of Third Place Books&rsquo; new Seward Park store, which will open in late April.</p></li>

<li><p>Seattle author Lesley Hazleton&rsquo;s upcoming book on agnosticism, <em>Agnostic: A Spirited Manifesto</em>, has earned <a href="https://accidentaltheologist.com/2016/02/10/two-thumbs-up-for-agnostic/">two places of pride in the most recent issue of <em>Publishers Weekly</em></a>. Hazleton&rsquo;s book received a starred review praising &ldquo;her appealing voice and accessible prose,&rdquo; and it was also chosen as a most-anticipated book of the spring. <em>Agnostic</em> is due out this April, and we can&rsquo;t wait.</p></li>

<li><p>The award-winning <em>Ms. Marvel</em> comic written by Seattle writer G. Willow Wilson has been nominated for another award â€” this time, it&rsquo;s up for <a href="http://comicsalliance.com/mcduffie-award-nominees/">the Dwayne McDuffie Award for Diversity in Comics</a>. McDuffie was a giant in the comics world and a champion for diversity in a time when it seemed as though comics would always be the province of straight white dudes, so this is a real honor. Congratulations to Wilson, and a recommendation to our readers: the most recent issue of <em>Ms. Marvel</em>, which hit comics stands yesterday, might be her best yet.</p></li>

<li><p>Seattle cartoonist Tom Van Deusen has a pretty great autobiographical comic in this week&rsquo;s <em>Seattle Weekly</em> about Seattle&rsquo;s housing crisis. You <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/home/962989-129/scene-report-housing-in-seattle">really should go read it</a>.</p></li>

<blockquote>Recent surveys in Britain, the United States and Australia have revealed a serious slump in the income that authors receive from their writing. In Australia, authors have seen their average income from writing decrease from about $22,000 in the early 2000s to less than $13,000 in 2015. For many authors, that means they can no longer earn a livelihood from their work.</blockquote>

<li>And because it&rsquo;s always better to end on a weird note than a bad note: Amy Brady has published a remarkable interview with the founders of the dark web&rsquo;s first literary magazine <a href="http://lithub.com/bringing-literature-to-the-dark-web/?utm_content=buffer8e963&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">over at Literary Hub</a>.</li>
