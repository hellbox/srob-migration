<p>The antique cards from my great grandmother,<br>
the photographs of ancestors I did not know,<br>
so much regal furniture, I sat in a closed off<br>
parlor, quiet in a King George chair, looked</p>

<p>across the room at the matching couch,<br>
the grand organ, the gold trimmed tall mirror<br>
with marble at its base, hung full length<br>
between tall windows formally draped.</p>

<p>I loved the quiet in this room, the history I<br>
never understood. The organ no one played,<br>
out of tune, a museum for far away relatives<br>
in England or Holland, mother’s side</p>

<p>of the family, who tried to stay wealthy<br>
but exposed to the elements oxidized<br>
in a slow decline, till it wore thin this family<br>
chain, clear to inevitable death.</p>

<p>So much no one remembers, only two chairs<br>
left, reupholstered, and the mirror, yes, the<br>
mirror, now on sister’s wall in Philadelphia,<br>
no longer with its marble stand, but it hangs</p>

<p>a view to see ourselves, how we have walked<br>
through to this other side &mdash; some of us &mdash; who<br>
would be us, long disappeared, those still here<br>
with traces in our blood, on our walls, in the</p>

<p>pictures we grow older and more distant<br>
every decade &mdash; this rusty chain still present &mdash;<br>
binding like a cross, there is no escape, no matter<br>
the life we live now.</p>
