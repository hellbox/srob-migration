<p>Today, in case you can&rsquo;t tell from the flurry of posts on the internet and on this site, is the official release day of the <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> sequel/prequel. If you&rsquo;re frustrated by the overkill, I promise it will all be over tomorrow. But until then, <a href="http://qz.com/452650/harper-lee-revisions/">Quartz has discovered</a> that significant portions of <em>Watchman</em> very closely resemble significant portions of <em>Mockingbird</em>. Of course, self-plagiarism is no crime — and by all accounts, <em>Watchman</em> was an early draft of <em>Mockingbird</em>, which explains the overlap — but it again raises the question of why <em>Watchman</em> even exists.</p>

<p>If a large chunk of the book has already been cannibalized to create another (most likely better) novel, why should anyone bother to read the cannibalized version? It&rsquo;s like putting all the stone chips left over from the sculpting of Michaelangelo&rsquo;s <em>David</em> on a pedestal and calling it <em>Not David</em>. The art isn&rsquo;t in the scraps used to make the art. The art is what&rsquo;s left after you do all the cutting and shaping and merging. Art is the product of intent, not the happenstance of creation.</p>
