<p>This e-mail from Artist Trust is great news:</p>

<blockquote>Artist Trust is pleased to announce that Brian McGuigan has been hired as its Program Director.

McGuigan has worked in programs and marketing for over a decade at Hugo House and ArtsWest. He is the co-founder and curator of the popular reading series, Cheap Wine & Poetry and Cheap Beer & Prose; the director of Lit Crawl Seattle; and an ambassador for On the Boards. In 2010, *The Stranger* shortlisted him for their Genius Award in Literature, and in 2011, *City Arts* named him one of Seattle’s ‘Power 50 Culture Makers.’ When he's not working in the arts, Brian's a writer himself. His essays have appeared in Gawker, Salon, *The Stranger*, The Rumpus, *ParentMap*, and elsewhere, and he has received support from 4Culture, Artist Trust, and the Office of Arts & Culture.</blockquote>

<p>Artist Trust helps all kinds of Seattle artists in every discipline with financial support and increased visibility. But speaking selfishly, <em>SRoB</em> is thrilled that such a <strong>dedicated book guy</strong> is taking over the programming. McGuigan knows every writer in town, and he&rsquo;s a passionate advocate for talent, both as a programmer and as a reader.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, he&rsquo;s <strong>a spectacular programmer</strong>; anyone who&rsquo;s attended the packed-to-the-gills Cheap Wine &amp; Poetry and Cheap Beer and Prose readings series at the Hugo House knows McGuigan&rsquo;s a great events curator, and he brought energy, spontaneity, and passion back to the Hugo House&rsquo;s stage after a few rough years of misdirection. He knows how to throw a party, is what we&rsquo;re trying to say, and we can&rsquo;t wait to see what he does with this new role.</p>
