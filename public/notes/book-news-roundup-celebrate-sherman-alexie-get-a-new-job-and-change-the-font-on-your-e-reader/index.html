<li><p>Congratulations to Sherman Alexie, who is this year&rsquo;s Pierce County Library system selection for <a href="http://www.blscourierherald.com/news/368092381.html">Pierce County Reads</a>. The library chose five of Alexie&rsquo;s books for everyone in Pierce County to read. They are: <em>The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven</em>, <em>Reservation Blues</em>, <em>Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em>, <em>Flight</em>, and <em>War Dances</em>. I wholeheartedly agree; everyone in Washington state should read all of those books.</p></li>

<li><p>Seattle Arts and Lectures is <a href="http://www.lectures.org/about_us/opportunities.php?id=26">hiring a Program Associate</a> for its Writers in the Schools program. If you support writing education for kids, this might be the job for you.</p></li>

<li><p>The lineup for the third Rainier Valley Lit Crawl <a href="http://gregbem.com/wordpress/2016/02/09/upcoming-event-rainier-valley-lit-crawl-3/">has been announced</a>. This one happens on March 5th. Start getting excited. One of the readings will happen at the Peruvian chicken joint Big Chickie, which surely represents some kind of a first in Seattle literary history.</p></li>

<li><p>Nationally, the book Twittersphere is very excited that Lisa Lucas, the former publisher of <em>Guernica</em>, <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/lisa-lucas-named-executive-director-of-national-book-foundation/?_r=0">has just been named the third Executive Director</a> of the National Book Foundation, which oversees the National Book Awards.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Selma</em> director Ava DuVernay is <a href="http://collider.com/ava-duvernay-a-wrinkle-in-time-movie-intelligent-life/">being pursued</a> to direct a film adaptation of <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em>. I would watch the hell out of that.</p></li>

<li><p>In the face of a consumer revolt, Amazon has <a href="http://www.teleread.com/amazon/amazon-rolling-back-evil-font-change-kindle-update-thanks/">changed the weight of a Helvetica font</a> on its Kindle e-readers. Readers weren&rsquo;t happy when Amazon swapped out the font for a lighter version.</p></li>
