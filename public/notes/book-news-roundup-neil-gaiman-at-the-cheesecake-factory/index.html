<li><p>Seattle&rsquo;s Office of Arts &amp; Culture is <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/arts/cityartist-projects">accepting applications for its CityArtist Projects grant</a>, which provides funds for artists seeking to complete a project. The grant changes disciplines every year, and literary artists are up for consideration this year. You have 55 days left to apply, so get to it.</p></li>

<li><p>Ted Closson&rsquo;s cartoon at The Nib titled &ldquo;<a href="https://thenib.com/a-gofundme-campaign-is-not-health-insurance">A GoFundMe Campaign Is Not Health Insurance</a>&rdquo; is required reading. It seems that every day I see another writer or musician or artist in medical distress whose lives depend on the outcome of a GoFundMe campaign. This, of course, is total bullshit.</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of crowdfunding, here&rsquo;s something: &ldquo;<a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/neil-gaiman-will-do-a-live-reading-of-the-cheesecake-factory-menu-if-we-raise-500000-for-refugees">Neil Gaiman Will Do a Live Reading of the Cheesecake Factory Menu If We Raise $500,000 for Refugees</a>.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>At <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/05/the-real-reasons-for-marvel-comics-woes/527127/#article-comments?utm_source=twb"><em>The Atlantic</em>, Asher Elbein writes</a> about the turbulence that Marvel Comics is experiencing at the moment. It turns out that Marvel isn&rsquo;t flailing due to an increased drive toward diversity (as some dipshit white men on the internet claim). In fact, Elbein argues, the company has fallen deep into a negative feedback loop of insularity and ego.</p></li>

<li><p>At <a href="http://www.comicsbeat.com/along-with-all-its-other-problems-marvel-also-has-a-library-problem/">The Beat</a>, Heidi MacDonald backs up Elbein&rsquo;s column with her own observation:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>...I came upon yet another problem for Marvel: working with libraries – another source of easy money for most publishers – isn’t much of a priority for them...As one prominent librarian put it to me, “People [in the library space] ask me is there a way to contact Marvel and I say, ‘nope it’s just impossible.’ Often, they’re people who want to buy 200 copies of something. I say ‘Good luck!'”</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>I just want to confirm MacDonald&rsquo;s experience and add that Marvel never supplies the media with review copies, a weird policy held by virtually no other publisher in the business. Additionally, I&rsquo;ve talked to multiple writers over the years who argue that, for a company that likes to brag about the high value of its intellectual property, Marvel pays its contributors very little. Maybe if they actually invested in their people, Marvel wouldn&rsquo;t be suffering from low sales?</p></li>

<li><p>Yesterday, Amazon opened its first Amazon Books brick-and-mortar store in New York City. <a href="https://qz.com/990164/amazons-first-bookstore-in-new-york-city-sucks-the-joy-out-of-buying-books/">Thu-Huong Ha from Quartz didn&rsquo;t enjoy the experience</a>:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>The store doesn’t let you escape the noise of shopping online: One section is for books with more than 10,000 reviews; another display is for “page-turners,” based on ebooks that customers have read in three or fewer days; with a few exceptions, books need a 4-star review to be in the store; to enter, you have to walk around a table showing books 4.8 star-rated or higher.</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Of course, the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/09/the-algorithm-method/">visited the very first Amazon Books store in University Village</a> when it opened two years ago. We were horrified.</p></li>

<li><p>We&rsquo;ve visited Amazon Books a few more times in the intervening years, too.</p></li>

<li><p>We&rsquo;re still horrified.</p></li>
</ul>
