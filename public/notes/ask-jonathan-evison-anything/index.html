<p>At 2 pm, Bainbridge Island author Jonathan Evison, author of novels like <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/heaven-is-a-place-on-earth/"><em>This Is Your Life, Harriet Chance!</em></a> and the excellent <a href="https://medium.com/@paulconstant/bringing-the-hurt-ae10a2311d55#.yhs1anyzw"><em>The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving</em></a> will be doing an Ask Me Anything on Reddit. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3v65p1/hi_im_jonathan_evison_author_of_this_is_your_life/">Follow this link</a> and, well, ask Evison anything. In my experience, he&rsquo;s always been <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/how-much-do-novelists-make/Content?oid=15445088">remarkably open</a> in interviews, from the business side of things to what he thinks of other writers. I can pretty much guarantee he&rsquo;ll be painfully honest, which makes this an interesting opportunity for those burning questions you&rsquo;ve always wanted to drop on a novelist.</p>
