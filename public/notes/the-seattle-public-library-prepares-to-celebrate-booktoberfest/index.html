<p><strong>Dear all literate adults of drinking age in Seattle</strong>: The Seattle Public Library is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1501246780167954/">hosting a happy hour at the Diller Room on Monday, October 19th</a>. Why more libraries don&rsquo;t encourage drinking, frankly, is beyond me. This happy hour is part of a new program that&rsquo;s running next month. I&rsquo;ll let SPL explain:</p>

<blockquote>Throughout October The Seattle Public Library brings you **Booktoberfest**, a celebration of books and beer at venues all over the city. Check out additional events, including Librarians’ Revenge Trivia Rounds, Bookish Happy Hours, ‘Ales from the Crypt: Spooky Stories ‘n Suds and more. Come join us, grab a pint, and get bookish!</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;d also encourage you to go and meet your librarians and tell them how much you love them and then buy them a beer because librarians are magic people who deserve all the beer you can throw in their general direction.

Please do and then tell your friends to do the same; this is important.)</p>
