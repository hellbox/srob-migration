<p>Last week, <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> cofounder Martin McClellan, associate editor Dawn McCarra Bass, and I attended the <a href="https://lectures.org/">Seattle Arts and Lectures</a> annual Words Matter fundraising dinner, where this website was honored with the 2018 Prowda Literary Champion Award. We had the privilege of sharing a table with the recipient of the individual 2018 Literary Champion Award, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawmakers-nra-money/story?id=53230001">Mary Ann Gwinn</a>.</p>

<p>At the dinner, SAL showed this video, made by the brilliant folks at <a href="http://www.goldenlasso.com/">Golden Lasso</a>:</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re humbled to be mentioned in the same breath with the other Prowda winners. But of course we didn&rsquo;t do any of this on our own. We would like to thank <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/">all our columnists and reviewers and poets and artists</a> for joining us on this adventure. (And an extra-special shout out to <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/cienna-madrid/">Cienna Madrid</a> and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/christine-marie-larsen/">Christine Marie Larsen</a> for being with us from the very beginning, back when the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> was just a pile of code on Martin&rsquo;s screen.) We love <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor">our sponsors</a> for making the site financially viable for the almost-three years we&rsquo;ve been in business.</p>

<p>And of course you, our readers, are the reason we do this. Your passion for Seattle as a world-class city of literature inspires us every day. Thanks for reading and for sharing the site with your friends and for sending us tips and corrections and words of encouragement. We&rsquo;re just getting started, and we&rsquo;re so thrilled to have you along for the ride. Thank you.</p>
