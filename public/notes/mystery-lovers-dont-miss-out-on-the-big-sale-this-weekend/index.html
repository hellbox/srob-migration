<p>If you&rsquo;re a mystery fan, you&rsquo;re likely still stinging from the loss of Pioneer Square&rsquo;s Seattle Mystery Bookshop. But you should know that this Saturday you&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to find some great deals on mystery novels while also supporting the Friends of the Seattle Public Library.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.friendsofspl.org/book-sales/">9 am to 5 pm at the North Seattle College, the Friends of the Library will host their holiday &ldquo;better&rdquo; book sale</a>, which features &ldquo;like-new&rdquo; books that make for great gift opportunities. The thing that makes this sale extra-special is that before they closed, Seattle Mystery Bookshop donated a significant part of their collection to the Friends. You&rsquo;ll find a lot of that collection at this sale.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling selfish and want to keep the books for yourself, that&rsquo;s okay, too. Books start at $3 a pop, and it benefits a great cause.</p>
