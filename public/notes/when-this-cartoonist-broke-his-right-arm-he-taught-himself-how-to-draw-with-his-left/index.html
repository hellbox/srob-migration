<p class="intro">From his [*Punch to Kill* comics](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/sex-and-violence-and-the-sex-of-violence/) to his work organizing the [dearly departed *Intruder* magazine](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/07/05/barging-right-on-in/), Marc Palm is one of the most active members of Seattle’s cartooning community. So when Palm announced on Facebook earlier this summer that he broke his right arm — his dominant arm, the arm that did all his drawing — the community responded with a visceral heartbreak: one of Seattle’s most prolific and enthusiastic cartoonists was going to be out of commission for the foreseeable future. But then Palm did something unexpected: he taught himself how to draw with his left hand. I talked to him in late August about his experiences.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Thank you for doing this. I’ve been following along on your journey on Facebook and I think it's really fascinating. Let me start with a couple of personal anecdotes. I want to get your impression of them.**</p>

<p><strong>First, I had a friend who was an artist in high school. His mother likes to tell the story that when he was a kid he used to walk around the house with his hands in oven mitts. He&rsquo;d hold his hands in the oven mitts right up to his chest because he was so terrified that anything would happen to his hands.</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Oh, wow.</p>

<p class="noindent">**He identified as an artist so much that it was like a fear for him. He felt like he’d have no identity without his art.**</p>

<p><strong>And then second, my grandmother was born a lefty. At her school they tied her left hand behind her back until she became right-handed, because they thought left-handedness was a weakness of character.</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Is she alive?</p>

<p class="noindent">**She died, a long-time ago. But she had Alzheimer's, and she actually reverted to left-handedness toward the end there. I thought those two stories might give you an idea of what I was thinking about when I heard about your story.**</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of which, I want to shut up and hear your story. So to start at the beginning, you bought a skateboard, right?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Well, no. For the last couple of years I've been getting more and more interested in skateboarding. When I was 12, my parents got me a skateboard — a big clunker. Then they got me pads and helmet and all this other stuff to be safe. And I tooled around in my driveway, which was the smoothest surface I had. But even then, I didn't wear gloves. I didn't wear oven mitts walking around or whatever, but I was a very careful child.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a very careful person my whole life, really. So when I was 12 I was like, ‘You know. I think I&rsquo;m gonna hurt myself. I don&rsquo;t really want to do this.’ Skateboarding was just cool to watch. I was gonna be a fanboy of it.</p>

<p>But then in the last couple years I was just getting more and more into watching it, and admiring it and thinking, ‘Wow, this is cool. Maybe I should give this a shot.’ So, [Seattle cartoonist] Ben Horak said, ‘I got this board I picked up from somebody. I&rsquo;m never gonna use it cause I&rsquo;m too scared to hurt myself, if you want it.’</p>

<p>He hands me off this skateboard. And whoever had it before, they actually were a skater. The thing was pretty well ground up, and it worked well. I was kind of tooling around wherever I could.</p>

<p>A couple of other cartoonists and started skating. They were very encouraging like, ‘You&rsquo;re not gonna hurt yourself. Don&rsquo;t worry about it.’ So we&rsquo;d go find flat surfaces — tennis courts or parking lots or whatever. We call it ‘skate dad parks.’</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where, inevitably, it happened.</p>

<p>It was the big Gotham Asylum up on Beacon Hill — the hospital up there. We found this great parking lot. No one bothered us. So I was off on one side, and they were on the other, and I just made this turn and there were some rocks, and I just stopped the board. And then I just landed directly down on my wrist, and that&rsquo;s when I eventually broke a chunk off the &hellip; I forget what that is. It&rsquo;s one of the long arm bones.</p>

<p>I had never broken a bone, and I tried my best to avoid it. Until picking up a skateboard.</p>

<p>It was the worst fear that I had. [When I started skating,] other people were like, ‘What if you break your drawing arm ?’ I’d say, ‘Yeah, I know, but it&rsquo;ll be fine.’ Then the worst case scenario happened.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Just to get some background: you're a fairly prolific artist. It seems like you must draw every day, right?**</p>

<p class="noindent">Yeah, I try to. It's definitely in my blood. And I've been doing it for thirty-plus years — just constantly producing and trying to do my best. But I'm not gonna kill myself over a broken arm. I just started going down the process of seeing if I could draw with my left.</p>

<p>My mom has a similar story to your grandmother’s. She was a lefty. She went to Catholic school, and they bound her left arm and forced her to go right. She eventually, grew out of it and went back to being a left-hander.</p>

<p>But while raising me she forced everything into my right hand. She was hoping that I wouldn&rsquo;t be a left-hander because she thinks it’s a curse. The world is right-handed, and she didn&rsquo;t want me to deal with the same problems she had. It&rsquo;s possible that I could have been a left-hander, had it just come naturally.</p>

<p class="noindent">**After you fell when did your thoughts turn to the fact that this was going to really screw up your drawing? How soon was it before you realized?**</p>

<p class="noindent">It wasn't like a big revelation, but it was definitely like, ‘Ugh, fuck. I broke my wrist. I can't draw.’ It was immediate and I tried not to be too bummed out about it. I was more annoyed that now I'm gonna be completely inconvenienced — I only have one hand. I work at the Fantagraphics warehouse and my job is lifting up packages and packing things and now I'm kind of wrecked on that.</p>

<p>I just thought I was gonna have to take a break. Which stinks, because I have a book that I&rsquo;m working on, and hoping to have done by Short Run. I immediately just realized I had to try to figure something out.</p>

<p class="noindent">**What did that process look like?**</p>

<p class="noindent">Oddly enough, months ago — maybe even a year ago — I was having a little paranoid fantasy, wondering what would happen if I couldn't use my right arm — if it got cut off or I broke it. I was just fascinated with the idea of what my left arm can do that my right can't.</p>

<p>So I tried buttering my bread with my left, and I realized that these two hands had no idea what to do when they&rsquo;re faced with something the other hand usually does. My right hand didn&rsquo;t know how to hold the bread properly, and my left hand didn&rsquo;t know the subtleties of spreading with a certain amount of pressure without stabbing through the bread.</p>

<p>I played around with that. I&rsquo;d started to be more efficient. I’d remind myself, ‘why don&rsquo;t I just grab the door handle with my left hand because that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s at instead of reaching all the way over from my right?’ I was already trying things with my left.’ I hadn&rsquo;t really tried to draw or anything, but I farted around and, like, tried to write my name with my left. It never went well.</p>

<p>So then, a couple days [after I broke my arm] I grabbed a big fat pencil, and I thought ‘maybe I can come up with a cute style,’ because normally my stuff&rsquo;s grotesque. I thought maybe I could actually draw cute things with my left hand.</p>

<p class="image">![](/webhook-uploads/1504670647291/DinosaurleftybyMarcPalm.jpg)</p>

<p>So I was drawing dinosaurs just to start out. They did look kind of childish, and it was hard to have the control that I wanted. But I saw that I could do <em>something</em>, so I just needed to focus a little harder.</p>

<p>So I changed tools. I went to the smallest micron pen I have. It&rsquo;s a .005. I started going really small and I found that when I was doing details with my left hand, I had a lot of control. But if I made big gestures, or made big strokes, it would get all wiggly and I didn&rsquo;t have the kind of control I wanted.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Wow, that is the exact opposite of what I would figure would happen.**</p>

<p class="noindent">I had a bunch of people encouraging me to try drawing with my left hand. At first, it kind of annoyed me. I was like, ‘You know, this is kind of a cute, fun thing to post online, but it kind of hurts.’</p>

<p>So after I did those dinosaur drawings I put one up right away. I was like, ‘All right, here you go. Everyone that says I should draw with my left, here&rsquo;s the drawings. Fifty bucks, let&rsquo;s go. If you want to support me, put your money where your mouth is.’</p>

<p class="noindent">**Yeah.**</p>

<p class="noindent">‘Or keep your cute little comments to yourself.’ All right, yeah, I could draw with my left hand. So then I just started working on it. As far as being an artist, you're basically dealing with like problem solving: ‘I've got a picture in my head. I need to get it on paper. How do I do that?’</p>

<p>And what was fascinating to me about doing this, was my way of working doesn&rsquo;t come from my right hand. It’s not the hand that does it — it&rsquo;s my brain. I can visualize where things have to go. I&rsquo;ve studied enough brush strokes and different techniques. I just needed to be able to get my left hand become a good tool, to get those lines to flow the way I want to.</p>

<p>So yeah, I took my time and really had to be patient and focus on the circle, where before, my right hand had been doing it for thirty close years. I was struggling to draw these little things. And I thought, ‘Wow, this is what it&rsquo;s like for like a normal person who doesn&rsquo;t know how to draw. I could see why they give up. This is hard!’</p>

<p>I realized that this is an enormous amount of work.</p>

<p>It basically was just working through it — figuring out how delicate I have to be, how hard do I want to press on this, what kind of style do I want?</p>

<p>Now I see it as really cool and fun. I&rsquo;m kind of addicted to it.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do you draw every day now with your left hand?**</p>

<p class="noindent">Yeah. I go to a coffee shop and sit there for an hour before work and just draw. And that was a great exercise. Every day, I sit there and pump out a new drawing.</p>

<p>And all the drawings I would be posting would take me two days or two mornings — an hour or less apiece. I even picked up speed as far as the amount of time I was working on them. I could do it faster and faster, and get more precise. It&rsquo;s interesting how it&rsquo;s an exponential growth of ability.</p>

<p>I feel my brain swelling.</p>

<p class="image">![](/webhook-uploads/1504670704674/VampirellabyMarcPalm.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">**Yeah, you really got good. I was following your story on Facebook and it seems like all of a sudden, you put up that drawing of of Vampirella, and I was like, ‘Holy shit.’ I don’t know how hard you are on your own work, but even you have to acknowledge that the difference is pretty impressive.**</p>

<p class="noindent">Oh no, that's the thing. It's weird because people come up and say, ‘Wow dude, you're drawing really well.’ And I share in their amazement: ‘Yeah, I know, right? These are really fucking good.’ And it's weird. I don't want to seem like I'm egotistical but I'm surprising the hell out of myself with this.</p>

<p>With that Vampirella one, I was sitting at home and just kind of sketching. I drew a different type of line. I had actually been trying to get to a point like that — I guess, like a looser style. It’s been hard to teach myself to get looser when I&rsquo;ve been trying to get tighter and tighter for years. And so my left hand had that looseness that I was looking for.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just been really weird and awesome to see it happen. The big drawing that blew my mind that I was able to complete it and make it look as good as what I would do with my right hand was the one with two witches brewing up the bongwater soup.</p>

<p>I use a brush pen usually, but I pulled out a nib pen I hadn&rsquo;t used in years and it worked out great. It was like this cool new toy to play with and get different effects.</p>

<p class="image">![](/webhook-uploads/1504670751017/BongWaterSoupbyMarcPalm.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">**There's still a difference between your left-hand and right-hand style, though, right? You've gotten better, but you haven't gotten the same.**</p>

<p class="noindent">No, but I'm definitely getting closer, which I'm not sure like.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating — I talked to one of my other cartoonist buddies, Kalen Knowles. He said, ‘What if I told you I like these [left-handed drawings] a little bit more than your other stuff?’ And my girlfriend was getting close to saying that to me too.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s weird to me because I&rsquo;ve been working so hard to get a style that I can be comfortable with, and can produce well with my right hand, for so long. And now I&rsquo;m coming up with this little bit more naïve, or raw, look with my left, and everybody&rsquo;s like, ‘Oh, I like that better.</p>

<p>It also looks more hand drawn. I guess that&rsquo;s what he was saying; it looks like it has a little bit more of a human hand to it.</p>

<p>And I think some people are drawn to that because it looks like something that they&rsquo;d be able to do. I&rsquo;ve had a couple of people say they like stuff that looks not too polished. If it&rsquo;s so polished and super hyper-realistic, they can&rsquo;t even understand it.</p>

<p>But if it looks like someone drew it, and there&rsquo;s mistakes and there&rsquo;s a wiggly line, then people get that. There must be something identifiable about it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to be cautious or kind of aware of how clean and how good my stuff looks, because I don&rsquo;t want it to look like it&rsquo;s made by a computer. I don&rsquo;t like a lot of digital art a lot of times. I see it as soulless. It&rsquo;s too clean, it&rsquo;s too nice.</p>

<p>So if [art drawn with my left hand is] a little rougher, or hand-drawn, or there&rsquo;s a mistake, that&rsquo;s cool. But I don&rsquo;t want my art to be full of mistakes. I look at a piece of my art and I see all my mistakes — I don&rsquo;t see how good it is. And I think that&rsquo;s the hardest thing for artists — liking your style, liking your little quirks, and all the strange things about it. Hopefully, your tastes match up with your audience.</p>

<p class="noindent">**So the cast is off, right?**</p>

<p class="noindent">Yeah, it came off yesterday. Thank God.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Have you been drawing a little bit? Have you had time to readjust to the right hand?**</p>

<p class="noindent">No, I’ve still got to go through some physical therapy. I have a new splint.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m going to have to [get back into drawing with the right hand] because I&rsquo;ve got to finish the vampire book I&rsquo;m working on. I&rsquo;m interested to see if my right hand has to learn to catch up now. Will I be able to jump back in? Or will my left hand now become the superior hand?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to using the left hand to sketch out things, or do my rough pencils, because it has that looseness. And then I&rsquo;ll ink it with my right hand so that I can get a tighter look.</p>

<p class="noindent">**So you’re looking to use both hands in the future? Like, at the same time?**</p>

<p class="noindent">I'm not a gecko. I can't spread my eyes and look at two different drawings at the same time. Not yet. I may well try.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Maybe you just need a head injury.**</p>

<p class="noindent">Be kicked in the head by a mule.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do you think you're going to finish the vampire book by the time [Short Run happens on November 4th](http://shortrun.org/)? Are people going to be able to see your latest stuff at your booth at Short Run?**</p>

<p class="noindent">Oh yeah, for sure. I have only a few pages left on the vampire book. It’s called *The Fang* and it's about a female vampire who has a job as an assassin of monsters.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also thinking about coming up with a left-handed publication of some sort. Like the closest thing I&rsquo;m ever going to do to an autobio comic, with photos, probably collages, and some sort of skate art. A photo of my skateboard, and x-rays from my hand, and then all my left-handed art. I think that&rsquo;s something I should definitely do.</p>

<p>I want to see if I can get, at the very least, a coffee shop to host a bunch of left-handed drawings.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do you have a book out right now that you think is a perfect example of your right-handedness at its apex, before the accident? So that readers can do a before and after comparison?**</p>

<p class="noindent">Oh yeah. The *Punch to Kill*s are the best I've done. And then, *The Fang* book is definitely the thing that I've been really excited about doing all this year. It definitely is looser than the *Punch to Kill*s, I think, and a little bit more fun.</p>

<p>So, yeah, there should definitely be stuff for sale at Short Run, so you can look at what I did this way and that way. Choose your poison. Pick your hand.</p>
