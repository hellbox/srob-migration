<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday, November 20th:  Columbia/Hillman Community Check-In**</h5></p>

<p>As part of their ongoing Inside/Out program, Town Hall asks the Columbia/Hillman City communities what they can be doing to assist inclusivity and togetherness in their events. This is worth attending even if you’re unfamiliar with Town Hall. This part of town has been changing for years, and it needs to reassess its cultural needs and desires before it moves into the future.
