<p>On Facebook, the founder of <a href="http://stackeddmagazine.com/">Seattle-area feminist magazine <em>Stackedd</em></a>, Maâ€™chell Duma Lavassar, made an exciting announcement: with the help of the good folks at Shunpike,  <em>Stackedd</em> has become a nonprofit:</p>

<blockquote>Beginning in January we will become an organization focused on what we do best &mdash; promoting women and non-binary folks in the fields of Art and Media. The Magazine will publish online bi-weekly and in print three times a year. In addition, we'll be teaching workshops, presenting forums and continuing and expanding our youth programs.</blockquote>

<p>Always great to see an ambitious player in the loca media landscape.</p>
