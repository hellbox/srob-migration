In the meanwhile, you can mosey over to the [Portrait Gallery archives](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/portrait-gallery/) to appreciate last weekâ€™s portrait of Carla Hayden and more. And if you have anyone in mind you think would make a good portrait, [let us know](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/about)!
