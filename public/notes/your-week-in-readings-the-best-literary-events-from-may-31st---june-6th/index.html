Scaachi Koul writes about culture for BuzzFeed. Her new, much-chatted-about collection of comic essays is about growing up in an Indian-Canadian family. Tonight, she’ll be in conversation with Seattle’s own Lindy West, who, as you may have heard, knows a thing or two about comedic essays.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Thursday June 1st: Interrupting Whiteness</strong></h5></p>
The whole idea of PechaKucha is that speakers simultaneously talk and show twenty slides for twenty seconds each. It’s a fun high-wire act of a public speaking spectacle. Tonight’s event is all about investigating the question of being white as it pertains to privilege, injustice, outreach, and responsibility.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Friday June 2nd: <em>Volcano</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Neil Matheson will discuss how geography affects the way we puny humans live our lives. We celebrate when we can see Mount Rainier on sunny days, for example, but beneath that celebration, there’s also an understanding that the mountain could, in theory, kill us all at any moment.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Saturday June 3rd: <em>The Inheritance of Shame</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
As a child, Peter Gajdics lived through six long years of a psychiatrist’s attempts to “convert” him from gay to straight. His memoir is about coming through so-called conversion therapy and learning how to love yourself after being exposed to so much rigorous, institutionalized hatred. (Reminder: Mike Pence still thinks conversion therapy is a good idea.)

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Monday June 5th: <em>Upstream</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Northwest author Langdon Cook has written at length about mushrooms. Now he’s turning his eye to another regional staple: salmon. (Press materials call salmon “perhaps the last great wild food.”) His new book is about the history of humanity’s relationship to salmon and the environmental impact that the salmon industry has had on the land.
