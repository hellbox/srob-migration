On the same weekend that Seattle Mystery Bookshop's GoFundMe campaign [draws to a close](https://www.gofundme.com/seattlemystery), Wallingford's delightful Wide World Travel & Maps — the oldest travel bookstore in the country — has [launched their own GoFundMe campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/wideworldbooks). They're looking to raise $30,000, and [according to Shelf Awareness](http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2698#m31577), Rick Steves' Europe has donated a compelling travel package if the store hits its goals.

As [I said when Seattle Mystery Bookshop announced their campaign](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/15/seattle-mystery-bookshop-launches-gofundme-campaign/), if crowd-funding isn’t your thing but you like to support independent bookstores, stop by Wide World Travel & Maps — they’re at 4411 Wallingford Ave N — and pick up a few books to prepare for an upcoming vacation, or a trip that you hope to one day make. What is a travel bookstore, after all, but a promise you make to yourself?
