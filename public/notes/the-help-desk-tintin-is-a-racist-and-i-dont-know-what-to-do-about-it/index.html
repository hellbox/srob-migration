<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

<p><strong>I absolutely love Tintin. I have since I was a kid, and still just fall for his outrageous antics. But oh my god, is it racist. So horrible! And, you know, all about white conquest. Do I have to give him up?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Minnie,</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not be histrionic. Lewis Carroll was a monogamous pedophile, Flannery O&rsquo;Connor was a devout Catholic and Ayn Rand claimed to be human. Even beloved children’s entertainer Ernest Hemingway believed that women have more holes for plugging than spiders have eyes, an old-fashioned but tenacious belief that has been empirically proven untrue without the aid of a high-powered drill.</p>

<p>My point is, if you start eliminating books, ideas, and people whose views make you uncomfortable, what&rsquo;s left? Whale sounds, cottage cheese, and more corpses than a bullfighting birthday party, that’s what.</p>

<p>Sure, Tintin is racist. It&rsquo;s certainly not the most racist thing to come out of 20th century entertainment, and even as it makes contemporary, less racist (fingers crossed) audiences uncomfortable, it&rsquo;s an important historical marker of the sentiment of the times. Ignoring our racist history doesn&rsquo;t erase racism, so feel free to keep cringing your way through <em>Tintin in the Congo</em>. And if you want to assuage your (presumably) white guilt, try tithing to a nonprofit group geared towards battling entrenched racism, groups like <a href="http://www.dreamdefenders.org/about">Dream Defenders</a> or <a href="http://byp100.org/about/">Black Youth Project 100</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
