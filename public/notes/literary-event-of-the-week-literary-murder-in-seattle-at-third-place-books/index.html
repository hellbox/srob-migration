<p>We look to novelists to inspire us, but we also look to them to tweak the ugliest parts of our imaginations, to invent the unimaginable, to speak the unsayable. It&rsquo;s not that humans are inherently bad, exactly. We&rsquo;re just inherently fascinated by bad behavior. That&rsquo;s why the Devil - with a little more than a glorified cameo - became the sleeper favorite character of the Bible. We like to think about terrible things, and then we like to put the book down and resume our ordinary lives.</p>

Tonight, Third Place Books in Lake Forest Park welcomes two local authors.  Mystery author Kevin O&rsquo;Brien, who has written thrillers with titles like <em>Hide Your Fear</em>, <em>You&rsquo;ll Miss Me When I&rsquo;m Gone</em>, and <em>No One Needs to Know</em>,  will be joined by Seattle expert David Williams, author of <em>Seattle Walks</em> and the excellent Seattle geographical survey <em>Too High &amp; Too Steep</em> in an onstage conversation. And you&rsquo;ve never seen an onstage conversation quite like this one.</p>

<p>According to Third Place Book&rsquo;s press materials, the two will take part in &ldquo;a fun and participatory conversation about the best REAL places in and around Seattle to kill someone (fictionally).&rdquo; Where in town would you be able to kill a person without someone else overhearing? Where would you be able to hide a body? Is there a spot around the Duck Tours route that would be better for murder than any other?</p>

<p>This is a great idea for an event: put two experts together - one Seattle geography expert, one fictional murder expert - and let them riff on the spot where their Venn diagrams mesh. I&rsquo;d love to see more bizarre literary pairings like this. Why not imagine all the fictional ways you can enjoy Seattle? Why not incorporate sci-fi authors, cookbook authors, historians, and juxtapose them in thrilling ways? I bet people all over Seattle are - forgive me - dying for an event like this.</p>
