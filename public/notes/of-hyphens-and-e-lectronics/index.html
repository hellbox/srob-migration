<p>We use a modified <a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html">Chicago</a> style here on the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>. Recently, editing a piece that used the term ‘ebook’ sparked a discussion over which was better: ‘e-book’ or ‘ebook’? To our eyes, ‘e-mail’ seems antiquated (we use ‘email’), but are electronic books different? They are more modern, after all. If we have to designated something as <em>electronic</em>, as opposed to analog, is the hyphen still necessary?</p>

<p>Help us decide. Take our first Twitter poll!</p>
