<p>We just got an invitation from Thomas Walton, the founder of <em>PageBoy Magazine</em>, which is one of the best print lit mags in the city. He&rsquo;s launching a new series of pop-up parties called, appropriately enough, &ldquo;Art Party.&rdquo; Because it&rsquo;s too late to get it into Your Week in Readings, I thought I&rsquo;d share it with you here:</p>

<blockquote><p>Please join *PageBoy Magazine* for the inaugural episode of Art Party.</p>

<p>**What it is**: an art party with visual art and video by Sara Long. Prose by Stacey Levine. Poetry by Paul Nelson. Comedy by Ryan Casey and Doug Gale. Plus: the world’s first ever Hanging Bookshop!</p>

<p>**What we want to do**: counteract the disappearance of art spaces, bookshops, galleries, etc. throughout the city, and their systematic replacement with sterile architecture, sterile businesses, and profiteering development.</p>

<p>**How we’re going to do it**: by holding art parties in temporary open spaces within apartment buildings, commercial buildings, donated spaces, etc.</p>

<p>**Why we want to do it**: art makes for healthy cities, and healthy citizens; aesthetics matter!</p>

<p>**Where**: this first event to be held at 729 10th Ave E #1 (Capitol Hill)</p>

<p>**When**: Sunday 12/13 at 7 p.m.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have no idea what the &ldquo;Hanging Bookshop&rdquo; bit means, but you bet I&rsquo;m curious. Paul Nelson is a great reader of his own work. And if you haven&rsquo;t seen her read, Stacey Levine is an absolute trip. She&rsquo;s perfectly warm and friendly in person, but when she&rsquo;s onstage she&rsquo;s a spectral voice from another, much cooler dimension than ours. This should be an interesting evening out. And really, what better plans do you have for a Sunday night in December? None. You have none better plans.</p>
