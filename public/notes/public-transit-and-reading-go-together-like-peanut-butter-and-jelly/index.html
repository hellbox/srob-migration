<blockquote>This summer, the Romanian city of Cluj-Napoca unveiled a new initiative designed to both promote literacy, and encourage residents to take advantage of municipal public transportation: From June 4-7, anyone reading on the cityâ€™s busses, trams or trolley, was be allowed to ride, entirely free of charge.</blockquote>

<p>What a great idea! I&rsquo;d love to see Seattle Public Library and King County Metro team up for something like this. The only downside to walking to work is that I miss the huge swaths of reading time that public transit offered me. I&rsquo;d read an extra book or two a week, back in the days when I rode the bus to work.</p>
