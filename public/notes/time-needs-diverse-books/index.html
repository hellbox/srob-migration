<p>People! Ask yourselves questions about your assumptions before you make best-of lists. Something like this, from <em>Time</em> magazine, is no longer acceptable in 2015:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/TIME">@TIME</a>&#39;s best books of the year so far is 100% white: <a href="http://t.co/kllUcxQtoP">http://t.co/kllUcxQtoP</a></p>&mdash; Amanda Nelson (@ImAmandaNelson) <a href="https://twitter.com/ImAmandaNelson/status/627193126382346240">July 31, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>Either <em>Time</em> is arguing that no person of color produced an amazing book this year, or they&rsquo;re admitting that they&rsquo;re only interested in books by white people. Neither option is good.</p>

<p>At the very least, this is a fine opportunity to remind you to check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/weneeddiversebooks?src=hash">#weneeddiversebooks hashtag on Twitter</a>, where we&rsquo;re reminded that good books are being published all around us. It&rsquo;s our responsibility to find them — especially for those of us who happen to work in the media.</p>
