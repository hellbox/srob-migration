<p><a href="http://design-milk.com/boutique-hotel-portland-maine-inspired-local-newspaper/">Design Milk published a photo-heavy tour of the Press Hotel</a>, a new boutique hotel constructed from the old <em>Portland Press Herald</em> newspaper building in Portland, Maine. It&rsquo;s a little too precious — my heart hurts to see perfectly good typewriters used as decoration — but on the whole it&rsquo;s a gorgeous, writerly space. Maybe they&rsquo;ll offer a writer-in-residence program? Those writing desks look particularly welcoming.</p>
