<p class="noindent">Northwest writer Jeffrey Warren &mdash; a long time Seattle resident &mdash; set his latest book _Justifiable Homicide_ largely in the city, amongst our high-tech firms. It covers investigative reporting, drug rings, computer _wunderkinds_, and most notably: encryption. A subject Warren knows well: he's an entrepreneur and engineer.</p>

We've run the <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">full first chapter from _Justifiable Homicide_ on our Sponsor's page</a>. If you like gripping thrillers, we think you'll like what you find there.
