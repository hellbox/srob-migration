Tomorrow night at Third Place Books Seward Park at 7 pm, I hope you'll join *Seattle Weekly* editor-in-chief Mark Baumgarten and myself and my *Seattle Review of Books* cofounder Martin McClellan in a discussion of Jonathan Haidt's amazing book *The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion*. 

The May installment of our Reading Through It book club is more theoretical and less interested in current events. It's more than just a way to understand the conservative perspective — it's about the many ways that we all seek to organize the world to suit our individual worldview. This could be the most important book we've discussed yet, and it's sure to be a fantastic conversation. I hope you'll join us.
