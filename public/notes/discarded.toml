Just because I can now trap a spider<br>
between cup and paper and set it free<br>
doesn’t mean I’m no longer afraid.<br>

Just because I sometimes believe<br>
in the divine doesn’t mean I don’t see <br>
emptiness every time I close my eyes.<br>

The man down the street<br>
has made a home out of things<br>
I’ve thrown out:

used retail bags, duck-taped and stretched, <br>
keep the rain at bay, old clothes<br>
insulate his walls and my empty wine bottles<br>
make wind chimes that echo through the night.

I call him homeless<br>
but the only difference between us<br>
is his walls aren’t built to code.

Just because I can spin a seductive line<br>
or two doesn’t mean I know<br>
how to talk to love. 

I can chatter all day,<br>
but what do I say when love<br>
stands naked in front of me

all hardness and need?<br>
What combination of letters<br>
could say anything other than

_Thank You?_

The man I call homeless,<br>
he talks to love. I hear him<br> 
when I walk to the bus stop in the mornings.

Sometimes they argue,<br>
but mostly I hear him cooing to love,<br>
wrapping love in my discarded wool sweater.
