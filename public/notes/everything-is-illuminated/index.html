<p>We love Greenwood&rsquo;s literary tutoring center <a href="http://fearlessideas.org/about/about-bfi/">The Bureau of Fearless Ideas</a> (formerly known as 826 Seattle) and we are big fans of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153508339199890.1073741869.53145114889&amp;type=3">this Facebook post demonstrating a recent student experiment in creating illuminated manuscripts</a>. It seems as though, with the general-interest acceptance of comic books, we&rsquo;re about due for an illuminated manuscript resurgence. Maybe one of these kids will lead the charge.</p>
