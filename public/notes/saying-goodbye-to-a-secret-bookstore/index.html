<p>Brazenhead Books in Manhattan has closed. Most of us never went there &mdash; it was an illegal store. Access, and the address, were shared amongst insiders. “The secret was known to a small number of discreet patrons and shared strictly by word of mouth,” says Brian Patrick Eha, in a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/saying-goodbye-to-a-secret-bookstore?mbid=rss">bittersweet New Yorker article</a> about the store, and its owner Michael Seidenberg.</p>

<p>I love the romantic idea of these secret hidden places — so long as I’m on the inside, of course (sucks to <em>not</em> know). But then the romance gives away to head scratching. Did Brazenhead take credit cards, or cash only? Did Seidenberg pay his taxes? How off-the-books was he, really? Did he have a business license? What about the assistant, mentioned in the article — were they paid under the table (he paid a fourteen year-old Jonathan Lethem in books for his work in a retail store)? The article conveniently skips the questions its very reporting begs.</p>

<p>Small businesses are hard work. The regulations and hoops you have to jump through — especially in New York City — are tremendous, and probably unreasonable. Which turns my thoughts to the indie bookstores who <em>do</em> jump through them to keep their doors open. At least they get some <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/bookstores-of-new-york">nice illustrations</a> from <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/endangered-bookstores-new-york">time-to-time</a>.</p>

<p>Not so long ago, Ken Kalfus <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-book-buyers-lament">lamented on these same storied (web)pages</a>: “Only a few of the city’s bookstores remain in business and they each need my patronage desperately.” I guess that goes for the secret illegal stores, as well as the ones anybody can walk into and browse to their hearts content.</p>
