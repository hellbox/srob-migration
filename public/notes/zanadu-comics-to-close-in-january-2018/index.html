<p>One of Seattle&rsquo;s oldest comics shops is set to close. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zanaducomics/posts/1438853082878733">Zanadu Comics posted on Facebook yesterday</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The good guys donâ€™t always win.

There are hundreds of reasons we could list, but the truth is that the money coming in does not equal the money going out.</blockquote>
