<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Friday June 3: <em>Sweetbitter</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Stephanie Danler’s debut novel is about a young woman who moves to New York City to make it big in the restaurant world. “Eating becomes a discipline language-obsessed,” Danler writes early in <em>Sweetbitter</em>. “You will never simply eat food again.” It’s a novel about senses and sensation, which is to say it’s about being alive.

<p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Sunday June 5: *King of the Worlds* Reading</strong></h5></p>
M. Thomas Gammarino’s new book from Seattle publisher Chin Music Press is a hyperactive science fiction road trip about an actor who loses the lead role in <em>Titanic</em> and then travels across time and space in the throes of a “trans-dimensional midlife crisis.” After his reading, I’ll be joining Gammarino for a talk. James Cameron will be discussed.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Alternate Sunday June 5: <em>The Face: A Time Code</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
<a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/open-faced/">Ruth Ozeki’s <em>A Time Code</em></a> is the best of three debut books in the new series <em>The Face</em>, in which authors write book-length essays about their own faces. (I <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/open-faced/">reviewed it a few months ago</a>.) In her outing, Ozeki stares at her own face in the mirror for hours at a time, and records her reaction. It’s a story about meditation, vanity, gender, and aging, from one of the best writers in the Northwest.

Jung Young Moon is a prominent experimental South Korean author who is finally debuting a translation of one of his novels in America. <em>Vaseline Buddha</em> is about the events surrounding the funeral of a goldfish named Kierkegaard. Moon’s publisher compares him to Kafka or Beckett, and this is an incredibly rare stateside appearance. <em>Seattle Asian Art Museum, 1400 E. Prospect, 624-6600, <a href="http://elliottbaybook.com">http://elliottbaybook.com</a>. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.</em></p>
