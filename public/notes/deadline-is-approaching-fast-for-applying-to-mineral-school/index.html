<p class="noindent">Time is running out to apply to Mineral School for their 2017 residencies. Especially of interest to parents is a new series funded by the <a href="http://www.sustainableartsfoundation.org"> Sustainable Arts Foundation</a>. Thanks to that support, they're offering funded weeks at Mineral School, including room, board, visiting author readings, and tons of privacy and workspace to get the ideas in your head out into the world. </p>
