<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_"China under the Covers" goes to press_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manaobooks/china-under-the-covers-goes-to-press?ref=category_recommended). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Margaret E. Davis](http://www.manaobooks.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
A bookbinding manual and an adventure tale, "China under the Covers" blends history, romance, and how-to as East and West connect.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    I'm a sucker for a book on how to bind books. It's that simple. That this one is from a Portland author, and the story has more than just how-to is a kind of bonus. It's a hybrid how-to-bind-books book, and that just seems like a great choice for this, our last Kickstarter Fund Project item. 
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
If you love bookbinding, China, the history of books and conservation, or just want to support a Northwest author, that's a good reason. But also, this is exactly the kind of book a large publisher would find a tremendous risk, but is perfect for Kickstarter. It proves there's a market, and it proves there's interest in stories this personal, interesting, and specific. 
</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    She's 144% funded, so it's obvious that there are many bookbinding nerds out there waiting for this book.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
