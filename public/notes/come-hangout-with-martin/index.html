<p>Last March, I ran <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hellbox/california-four-oclock-a-novel-about-the-lore-of-p">a successful Kickstarter to print my first novel, <em>California Four O&rsquo;Clock</em></a>. Kickstarter asked me if I&rsquo;d take part in their series &ldquo;Creator Hangouts&rdquo;, so today at 10 a.m. PST, I&rsquo;ll be doing just that.</p>

<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/c0d6cvie7bq46sl8idb933co408">Tune in at Google+ to take part</a>. I&rsquo;ll be taking questions on the Kickstarter, <em>The Seattle Review of Books</em>, and anything else people want to discuss. Come and join!</p>
