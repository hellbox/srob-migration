* The Short Run Festival [announced their latest special guest](http://shortrun.org/welcome-special-guest-hatem-imam/): Hatem Imam, a cartoonist and editor who was put on trial in Lebanon for the "crime" of publishing two supposedly controversial panels in anthology comics. [This *New Yorker* story has more information](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-fate-of-a-joke-in-lebanon) about the trial. Imam's appearance in Seattle this fall will undoubtedly kick off a citywide conversation about religion, censorship, and satire. Short Run is on November 5th this year.

* Starting on July 11th, Seattle-area fiction writers will [be able to apply](http://artisttrust.org/index.php/for-artists/money#gar_lasalle_storyteller_award) for the second annual Gar La Salle Storyteller award, "an unrestricted award of $10,000 given to a Washington State artist who is engaged in storytelling through their work in various artistic disciplines." That's some big money. The first winner of the Award was [local writer Anca Szilágyi](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/08/anca-szil%C3%A1gyi-wins-the-first-gar-lasalle-storyteller-award/).

* Over [at Comics Grinder](https://comicsgrinder.com/2016/07/03/interview-david-schmader-on-literacy-neighborhoods-lgbtq-and-cannabis/), Henry Chamberlain interviews David Schmader about the Bureau of Fearless Ideas, [*Weed: A User's Guide*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/27/an-interview-with-david-schmader-the-brand-new-creative-director-at-the-bureau-of-fearless-ideas/), and why pot isn't for everyone:

<blockquote>Yeah, and apparently gin turns some people into monsters. So, the idea is that not everyone is going to like weed; and don’t think there’s anything wrong with you if you don’t like weed. Because it’s all about your system and what kind of feelings you enjoy.</blockquote>
