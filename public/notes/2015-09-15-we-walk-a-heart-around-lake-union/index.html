        <p>and you point to buildings and streets<br>
that bear the scars around your own:<br>
the elementary school that taught you<br>
difference and its consequences; the law <br>
firm where twenty-five years later your daily<br>
prayer and <em>hijab</em> reinforced the lesson.<br>
There, the bus stop where you last saw<br>
your brother, out of his mind and out of your<br>
reach, his mouth an open sore.<br>
We’ve talked many times before about <br>
what it means to be noticed, to be<br>
threatening and invisible at the same time.<br>
In this way, we are sisters. We stay close,<br>
two brown women walking together.<br>
<em>This city’s always been very segregated</em><br>
and it’s true that when you walk north<br>
the prices rise and the faces pale.<br>
We touch the Scotch broom and lilacs <br>
erupted in spring, notice the renegade ferns <br>
growing upon the stumps of old docks.<br>
All along the water’s edge, we note the glorious blue<br>
made bluer by the hulls of gleaming white boats;<br>
upon a hillside suffuse in green, amid artifacts of rust,<br>
people fly kites, edging out over the skyline.<br>
<em>On your left!</em> Bikers zoom past us, their spandex, <br>
the shine of their helmets, rejoicing. <br>
It’s true that people here are different <br>
when exposed to the sun; they crowd <br>
the sidewalks with strollers and wagging dogs. <br>
Sunglasses, then. Smiles and hellos.<br>
We pass condo after condo, clustered houseboats, <br>
marinas of artisan sailboats, luxury yachts.<br>
<em>Who are these people</em>, we ask, looking in.<br>
All day you’ve spoken the landscape of your life<br>
as we walk among places that no longer exist &mdash;<br>
neighborhoods reconceptualized and fenced off.<br>
<em>This city does not want me.</em><br>
What do we do when the ground we claim<br>
as home changes beneath our feet?<br>
Landscape, layered. You can look back, <br>
remember the stories beneath all this shine.<br>
We part ways upon a freshly paved greenspace.<br>
In the shadow of History and Industry, people <br>
play bocce on gravel among orange café seating.<br>
Beneath an awning along the water, <br>
a man carves a canoe from salvaged cedar.</p>
