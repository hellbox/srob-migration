* Seattle-area writer Ted Chiang has long been one of the local sci-fi community's best-kept secrets. Just about every Seattle sci-fi writer worth their salt counts Chiang as one of their favorite writers, but his work has not garnered larger acclaim. That's all about to change: one of Chiang's short stories is about to be adapted into an upcoming film called *Arrival* starring Amy Adams that is attracting a lot of pre-release buzz.[The *Wall Street Journal* published](http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-story-in-sci-fi-writer-ted-chiangs-life-hollywood-1478015805) a great little profile of Chiang yesterday that you should read.

<blockquote>“He’s got a really good mix of humanity and science, unlike some writers,” said Ellen Datlow, the editor who acquired “Tower of Babylon,” the first story of Mr. Chiang’s to be published, for *Omni* magazine in 1990.</blockquote>

* While we're talking about Seattle-area writers, [*Electric Lit* published a long interview](https://electricliterature.com/native-voices-wont-be-silenced-aede8c2adc6b#.niuao1g71) with Elissa Washuta that you should read.

* So this is kind of creepy: [according to GeekWire](http://www.geekwire.com/2016/amazon-gives-prime-members-better-prices-physical-bookstores-hinting-new-retail-strategy/), at Amazon's brick-and-mortar bookstore, you're apparently only able to buy books on discount if you're an Amazon Prime customer. If you're not on Prime, you pay full list price.

* Greta Van Susteren has a bad opinion about the cost of colleges. Rather than cutting the ridiculously expensive stadiums or coaches' salaries, she seems to think libraries are making colleges too damn expensive:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Colleges should stop building vanity projects like huge libraries and billing students-full libraries are on our smartphones! <a href="https://t.co/QBeVKZvIKZ">https://t.co/QBeVKZvIKZ</a></p>&mdash; Greta Van Susteren (@greta) <a href="https://twitter.com/greta/status/793052011386265600">October 31, 2016</a></blockquote>

* On that last item, let's be clear: books are an investment in education, and they are non-negotiable. In fact, eliminating library books from a college would disproportionately harm low-income students who might not have the technology needed for ebooks. This is clearly an idea that was not at all thought through.
