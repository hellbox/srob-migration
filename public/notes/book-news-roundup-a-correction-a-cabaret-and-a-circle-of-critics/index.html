<li><p>First, let&rsquo;s begin with a correction. In this week&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2018/03/12/literary-event-of-the-week-dock-street-salon-at-phinney-books/">Event of the Week column</a>, I credited the Dock Street Salon solely to Dock Street Press publisher Dane Bahr. In fact, Bahr co-hosts the salon with Seattle author and publisher <a href="http://www.bigfictionmagazine.com/">Heather Jacobs</a>. And this week&rsquo;s edition of the Salon was entirely curated and coordinated by Jacobs, not Bahr. I sincerely apologize to Jacobs for getting that wrong, and I&rsquo;ve amended the listing to give her proper credit.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.therendezvous.rocks/event/bell-battery-cabaret-now-2018-03-18/">Here&rsquo;s a last-minute event</a> you ought to know about: The Bell &amp; Battery Cabaret is a variety show that&rsquo;s happening at the Rendezvous at 8 pm tonight, and twice on both Saturday and Sunday. Performers include Markeith Wiley and Ade, and the show also features Seattle poet Shin Yu Pai, who says she will &ldquo;read a commissioned poem about nightclub singer Pat Suzuki and also sing a song.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ve got five chances to see this one, so get to it.</p></li>

<li><p>Did you <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/08/nearly-one-in-five-americans-now-listen-to-audiobooks/">see the Pew poll about American reading habits</a>? Turns out one in five Americans regularly listen to audio books, almost 75 percent of Americans read a book last year, and print books aren&rsquo;t going anywhere:</p></li>

<blockquote>Some 39% of Americans say they read only print books, while 29% read in these digital formats and also read print books. Just 7% of Americans say they only read books in digital formats and have not read any print books in the past 12 months.</blockquote>
