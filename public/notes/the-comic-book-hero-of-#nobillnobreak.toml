You are hopefully already [watching #NoBillNoBreak](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoBillNoBreak?src=tren&data_id=tweet%3A745704163443675136), the Democratic Congressional sit-in to demand a vote on gun responsibility laws. It's a striking bit of political drama, and a battle over one of the most important issues of our time. 

I just wanted to remind you that Georgia Congressman John Lewis, the [originator of this sit-in](http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/22/politics/john-lewis-sit-in-gun-violence/index.html), has been at this kind of thing for a very long time, and he is the author of an amazing autobiographical comics series called *The March* about the fight for civil rights. There are two volumes out right now â€” here's [Volume One](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781603093002), and here's [Volume Two](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781603094009). The third and final book in the series will be published [this August](http://www.comicsbeat.com/march-book-3-cover-and-pub-date-revealed/). If you're looking for inspiration, if you're looking to learn how to win a political fight when seemingly every force in the world is lined up against you, you should read these books.
