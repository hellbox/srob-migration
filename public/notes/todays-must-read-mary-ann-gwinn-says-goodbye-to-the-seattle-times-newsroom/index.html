<p>You have to read <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/closing-the-book-on-34-years-in-the-seattle-times-newsroom/">Mary Ann Gwinn&rsquo;s final column in her role as the <em>Seattle Times</em> books editor</a>. It&rsquo;s a grand and generous tour of the last 34 years in Seattle literary history. I&rsquo;m not going to pull a single quote here, because you should read the whole thing. (Full disclosure: I choked up a little at the shoutout to the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>.)</p>

<p>But before we get too somber, let&rsquo;s note that Gwinn is not disappearing: she will contribute columns to the <em>Times</em>, she&rsquo;s writing about books for other outlets, and she&rsquo;ll <a href="http://kcts9.org/programs/well-read">continue to co-host <em>Well Read</em> on KCTS</a>. But a three-and-a-half decade long career as a book reviewer is a remarkable achievement, and it deserves our recognition.</p>

<p>Thanks for everything, Mary Ann. Here&rsquo;s to many more years of talking about books.</p>
