<p>As <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/11/15/zanadu-comics-to-close-in-january-2018/">I reported last month</a>, Zanadu Comics, the second-oldest comics store in Seattle, is closing in January. Tonight, you&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to come start saying your goodbyes to the store. Zanadu employee Casey is hosting the final edition of Discussions from the Longtable, a comics conversation group, tonight at 6:30 pm. It promises to be an emotional time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Customers and employees would sit around the table and rant and rave about this or that while verging on sugar overdose from all the free candy&hellip;I love connecting with customers on another level and sharing not only our mutual joy of comics, but the energy that lies behind the covers,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zanaducomics/posts/1464961986934509">Casey writes in a Facebook post</a>.</p>

<p>Casey concludes, &ldquo;So be there TONIGHT at 6:30 for one more chance to eat lots of candy and rant and rave about comics!! Bring a friend!&rdquo;</p>
