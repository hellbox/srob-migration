<p>The excellent local literary magazine <em>The James Franco Review</em>, which has a blind submission policy intended to &ldquo;publish works of prose and poetry as if we were all James Franco, as if our work was already worthy of an editor’s attention,&rdquo; published <a href="http://thejamesfrancoreview.com/2015/07/30/editorial-dear-white-editors/">an editorial today</a> that all white editors — <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/">ourselves included!</a> — should read and take to heart.</p>
