        <p class="intro">*Every Friday, Cienna Madrid offers solutions to life’s most vexing literary problems. Do you need a book recommendation to send your worst cousin on her birthday? Is it okay to read erotica on public transit? Cienna can help. Send your questions to* advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p>
 

<p class="noindent">**This is not strictly a NaNoWriMo question, but maybe it will apply to some of the folks writing their novels this month: When I'm writing fiction, I can't let go of a sentence until it's perfect. I'm physically unable to move on and fix something in edits. It sometimes takes me a month to write a paragraph. And it's always a spectacular paragraph, if I do say so myself.  But at this pace, I'm not going to finish my first novel until I'm 68, and I'd rather not do my first book tour as a retiree. Any tips on moving past the imperfect to get to the good?**</p>
 

<p><p class="noindent"><strong>Needs Perfection, Woodinville</strong></p></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Needs Perfection,</p>

<p class="noindent">I have the same problem when I'm penning therapeutic revenge limericks about my enemies – although in my defense, it is extremely difficult to capture the insult of a friend stealing Les Schwab tire coupons from your home in anapestic meter, especially when that friend's name is Verdiana. What the fuck rhymes with Verdiana? Nothing, that's what.</p>

<p>We are in a rut, you and I. A rut that in my case was caused by driving on bald tires (Verdiana, you cow). You can&rsquo;t let go of a paragraph until it&rsquo;s &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; and I can&rsquo;t let go of a limerick until it ends with someone being metaphorically beaten with a tire iron in perfect rhyme.</p>

<p>What we both need is a change of approach. I&rsquo;m assuming you typically write on a computer – try writing with pen and paper instead. I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s harder to fixate on words on a page because editing them is such a messy process. Writing on paper feels like more of a first draft; our brains have been conditioned through years of school to know that writing by hand is both spontaneous and incomplete.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another trick that will put your obsessive perfectionist tendencies to better use: Work on creating a detailed outline of your entire book instead of creating perfect paragraphs. You must realize that much will be cut in the editing process, so why waste your time ensuring they&rsquo;re perfect now? Get the structure in place and then spend your time filling in the details.</p>

<p>As for me, likely I will have to give up on my limerick and resort to an old-fashioned form of revenge: stripping Verdiana&rsquo;s car of everything of value and donating the pieces to Jalopy Jungle. Perhaps after that, I can find it in my heart to send her an &ldquo;I forgive you&rdquo; limerick, instead:</p>

<blockquote><p>You stole my coupons, you cow</p>
<p>An insult I cannot allow</p>
<p>In lieu of wishing you dead</p>
<p>I stripped your Ford Taurus instead</p>
<p>Great news: I forgive you now.</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
