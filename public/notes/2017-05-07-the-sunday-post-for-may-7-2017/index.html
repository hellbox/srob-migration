        <p class="intro">Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles good for slow consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-sunday-post/" title="Sunday Post archives">look through the archives.</a></p>

<h5><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/g-willow-wilsons-american-heroes" title="The Writer Behind a Muslim Marvel Superhero on Her Faith in Comics - The New Yorker">The Writer Behind a Muslim Marvel Superhero on Her Faith in Comics</a></h5>

<p>In case you missed the link in our <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/05/04/thursday-comics-hangover-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-free-comic-book-day/" title=" Thursday Comics Hangover: How to get the most out of your Free Comic Book Day - Seattle Review of Books">warm-up to Free Comic Book Day</a>, Jia Tolentino profiled Seattle&#8217;s G. Willow Wilson in a recent issue of <em>The New Yorker</em>. Wilson, author of the much-awarded Ms. Marvel reboot, is as likeable as her breakout superhero: gentle, direct, and taking absolutely no shit from anybody.</p>

<blockquote>
At the coffee shop, as a barista cleared our plates, we talked about how the stakes of every identity-politics debate feel heightened since November — and also about new alliances that seem to be forming in the election’s wake. Wilson spoke with some astonishment about the fact that she could include a gay secondary character in “Ms. Marvel” — the blond, popular Zoe — and still have mothers and daughters show up to her readings in hijabs. “It’s funny. Those right-wing bloggers who said my work was part of some socialist-Muslim-homosexual attack on American values, they really created the thing they feared. There wasn’t a socialist-Muslim-homosexual alliance before, but there sure as fuck is one now, and I love it."

<p>This week <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe">&#8220;Believe,&#8221;</a> by Matthew Inman of <em>The Oatmeal</em>, is making the rounds with a characteristically cutting and charming assessment of why it&#8217;s so hard to change anyone&#8217;s mind. Over at <em>The Intercept</em>, Sharon Lerner interviewed Jerry Taylor, a one-time climate change denier, about his conversion to climate activist and how he&#8217;s working to shift others the same way. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/opinion/climate-of-complete-certainty.html?_r=0" title="Climate of Complete Certainty - New York Times">Bret Stephens take note.</a>) </p>

<blockquote>
If you talk about the need to transform civilization and to engage in the functional equivalent of World War III, you may as well just forget it. To most conservatives, that’s just nails on a chalkboard. Or if you say, you’re corrupted and a shill and ignorant. That’s no way to convince anybody of anything. What are the chances they’re going to say, Gee, you’re right? All that does is entrench someone in their own position.

<h5><a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/bill-gates-who-most-powerful-doctor/" title="Meet the world’s most powerful doctor: Bill Gates - Politico">Meet the world’s most powerful doctor: Bill Gates</a></h5>

<p>Speaking of Seattle and superpowers &#8230; The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has a huge influence on global health, and their enormous philanthropic buying power put them on par with, and maybe above, international players like the World Health Organization. How does an 800-pound gorilla learn to throw its weight gently — and help prepare for its own exit?</p>

<blockquote>
Over the past decade, the world’s richest man has become the World Health Organization’s second biggest donor, second only to the United States and just above the United Kingdom. This largesse gives him outsized influence over its agenda, one that could grow as the U.S. and the U.K. threaten to cut funding if the agency doesn’t make a better investment case.

<p>A very short collection of tweets we wish Warren Ellis had posted.</p>

<blockquote>
Very excited about America these days. Really enjoyed the MAD MAX films, looking forward to the theme park
