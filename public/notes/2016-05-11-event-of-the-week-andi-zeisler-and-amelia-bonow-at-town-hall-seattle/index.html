        <p>In the 1990s, feminists drew lines between a pair of up-and-coming magazines: in many social circles, you could either be a fan of <em>Bitch</em> Magazine, or you could be into <em>Bust</em>. <em>Bitch</em> was uglier than <em>Bust</em>, less glossy. <em>Bitch</em> was interested in feminist theory and it reviled the concept of selling out; <em>Bust</em> was more fun, more inclusive. <em>Bitch</em> had way more words per page, and fewer celebrity interviews. <em>Bust</em> got a fancy book deal and great placement on Borders’ newsstands around the country; <em>Bitch</em> was often tucked in the back of the racks, with the philosophy magazines and some of the weirder subcultural signifiers like <em>The Comics Journal</em>.</p>

<p>If you had asked me to predict the future back then, I probably would have sworn that one of those magazines would be gone by 2016. Though as far as I can recall, the editors of <em>Bitch</em> never explicitly called out the editors of <em>Bust</em> or vice versa, the two seemed eternally at odds. Two magazines enter the feminist Thunderdome, and only one can leave. Right? Happily, no. Both <em>Bust</em> and <em>Bitch</em> are still around today. There’s room enough in the world, it seems, for two perspectives on feminism.</p>

<p>But even in 2016, you’ve just gotta pick a side. My feminist tastes always leaned more toward <em>Bitch</em>, because it was prickly and sarcastic and dedicated to its own unalloyed principles. I didn’t realize it back at the dawning of the <em>Bitch</em>/<em>Bust</em> days, but by siding with <em>Bitch</em> I was declaring my allegiance to Andi Zeisler, the cofounder of the magazine. Zeisler’s writing exemplified—and still exemplifies—<em>Bitch</em> at its best: she’s smart and funny and honest and more than a little condescending to her enemies. Zeisler wrote in the 20th anniversary issue of <em>Bitch</em> that she was somewhat disappointed to see that her magazine was still around: “when your mission is to respond to crappy, insulting representations of gender, race, and more, after all, the goal is to put yourself out of business.” But there will always be more idiots, and so we should be grateful that there are people like Zeisler who can call those idiots out.</p>

<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1462576884365/wewerefeministsonce.jpg" alt="" /></p>
Zeisler has a new book out, and it’s predictably <em>Bitch</em>-y. <em>We Were Feminist Once</em> is a call to arms for feminists, an insistent manifesto charging that the old feminist ideals are being lost in a haze of “marketplace feminism.” While many women applaud when Taylor Swift calls herself a feminist, Zeisler accuses Swift, basically, of diluting the brand. At some point over the last twenty years, the idea of “selling out” became passé; Zeisler didn’t get that memo. She is not afraid to call out and shame people she believes are hurting feminism.</p>

<p>On the Seattle stop of her book tour, Zeisler will be in an extended conversation with Seattle-area #shoutyourabortion founder Amelia Bonow. Whoever thought up this pairing deserves a raise; Bonow is loud and unapologetic and more than a decade younger than Zeisler, which means the two will have to navigate a slight generational gap in order to reconcile their views on feminism. This should be a hell of a talk: loud, angry, unapologetic, funny as hell.</p>
