<p>Our thanks to sponsor Darin Bradley for his support over the past week. One reviewer said this about his novel <em>Chimpanzee</em> “So if you took <em>Twelve Monkeys</em>, add <em>The Time Traveler’s Wife</em> but subtract the time-travel, multiply by 1984, factor in <em>Strange Days</em> and divide by <em>Fight Club</em>, you get <em>Chimpanzee</em>.”</p>
