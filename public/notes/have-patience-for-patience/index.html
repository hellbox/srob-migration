<p>Yesterday, Seattle&rsquo;s own Fantagraphics Books <a href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/patience">formally announced <em>Patience</em></a>, the new graphic novel by Dan Clowes. It&rsquo;s the biggest original comic he&rsquo;s ever produced, and the description sounds fantastic:</p>

<blockquote>*Patience* is an indescribable psychedelic science-fiction love story, veering with uncanny precision from violent destruction to deeply personal tenderness in a way that is both quintessentially “Clowesian,” and utterly unique in the author’s body of work.</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a Clowes fan, but I think his best work skims the surface of genre — <em>Ice Haven</em> was a cross-disciplinary mystery novel, <em>The Death Ray</em> was a superhero comic riff. The fact that he&rsquo;s flirting with sci-fi again, for the first time since <em>Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron</em>, is a big damn deal. <em>Patience</em> will be released in spring of next year.</p>
