<blockquote><p>Pepe the Frog creator Matt Furie has made good on his threat to "aggressively enforce his intellectual property."</p>

<p>The artist's lawyers have taken legal action against the alt-right. They have served cease and desist orders to several alt-right personalities and websites including Richard Spencer, Mike Cernovich, and the r/the_Donald subreddit. In addition, they have issued Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown requests to Reddit and Amazon, notifying them that use of Pepe by the alt-right on their platforms is copyright infringement. The message is to the alt-right is clearâ€”stop using Pepe the Frog or prepare for legal consequences.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, the alt-right is fighting back, citing free speech. Nazis love to use the free speech defense. We&rsquo;ll see how that works out for them. Hopefully, <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/iwRJ2OyBPjwkM/giphy.gif">it will look something like this</a>.</p>
