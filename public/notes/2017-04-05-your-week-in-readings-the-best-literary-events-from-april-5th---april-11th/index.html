See our Event of the Week column for more details.
*Third Place Books Seward Park, 5041 Wilson Ave S, 474-2200, http://thirdplacebooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *
 
<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday April 6th: *American Junkie* Reading**</h5></p> 
Tom Hansen’s grunge-era Seattle memoir *American Junkie* is finally being reissued. It’s a story about drugs and punk rock and a city on the precipice of something bigger. To celebrate his book’s second chance on life, Hansen’s being joined by Seattle authors Sean Beaudoin and Joshua Mohr for a group reading and a moderated discussion. 
*Third Place Books Ravenna, 6504 20th Ave NE, 525-2347 thirdplacebooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m* 
 
<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday April 7th: Hugo Literary Series: Betrayal**</h5></p> 
The Hugo House brings three writers and a musician together to produce new work on a theme. The final event of the 2016-2017 season is “Betrayal.” Readers include poet Anis Mojgani, celebrated slam poet Kaitlyn Greenidge, and poet Rick Barot, along with musician Maiah Manser.
*Fred Wildlife Refuge, 128 Belmont Ave. E., 322-7030. http://www.hugohouse.org. $10-25. All ages. 7:30 p.m.*  

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday April 8th: *The Songs of Trees* Reading**</h5></p> 
So it turns out that trees are a lot weirder than we ever guessed. They communicate using bizarre fungus webs and they cultivate “bacterial communities” that serve all kinds of functions that we’re only just now learning about. In his newest book, David Haskell discusses the cutting edge of tree research, which should probably be known as “treesearch.”
 *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m.*

 <p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday April 9th: *Truth Be Bold* Reading**</h5></p> 
Julene Tripp Weaver is a Seattle poet who worked in AIDS services for over two decades. Subtitled *Serenading Life & Death in the Age of AIDS*, her latest collection continues the themes of her work. This afternoon, she debuts her book with nine local poets and AIDS educators in a reading hosted by local writer David Schmader.
 *Hugo House, 1021 Columbia St., 322-7030, hugohouse.org. Free. All ages. 4 p.m.* 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday April 10th: Ask the Oracle**</h5></p> 
Suzanne Morrison joins Seattle experimental writer Doug Nufer and prolific Seattle poet Megan Snyder-Camp as part of Hugo House’s divination-based reading series. Authors will answer audience questions using answers pulled from their texts. All three writers are great, but Nufer in particular could be a standout; he does lots of performance-based routines and should be especially devoted to the schtick.
*Sorrento Hotel, 900 Madison St., 622-6400, http://hotelsorrento.com. Free. 21 and over. 7 p.m* 

<p class-"image">![](/webhook-uploads/1490931176670/Ghosts-launch-banner-part-2.jpg)</p>
