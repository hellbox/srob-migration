<p class="intro">This Thursday night is Lit Crawl, a bacchanalia of literary events spread over four courses across Capitol Hill, First Hill, and downtown. [You can find the full schedule here](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2017-schedule), but we wanted to provide a few possible itineraries for people who have a hard time making up their minds. Come back tomorrow for the next itnerary.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1</strong>: Our first itinerary starts with a choice: are you a dystopian fiction nut, or do you like your sci-fi to be a broader deal? If you like dystopia, head to the Sorrento Hotel for an evening of postapocalyptic stories with readers Apple Plotnick Jannotta, Lynn Adams, and Johanna Stoberock. Prefer a wider scope on your speculative fiction? Saint John&rsquo;s bar is hosting Cat Rambo, Camille Griep, and Caren Gussoff Sumption.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 2</strong>: Head to ZoÃ« Events on Union for Meredith Clark, Katie Ellison, Leslie Frank, and Molly Thornton for a brisk 45-minute exploration of what genre can do. The copy for the event promises an evening that &ldquo;traverses across memoir, essay, and less definable forms to create cross-genre and hybrid nonfiction.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Phase 3</strong>: It&rsquo;s October, so it&rsquo;s time for horror. Ramon Isao, J. Lincoln Fenn, and Evan J. Peterson haunt the house that is Ada&rsquo;s Technical Books with a reading of scary fiction.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 4</strong>: Your evening of readings ends at Hugo House with a mystery-themed event from Rosemarie and Vince Keenan (who publish pseudonymously as &ldquo;Renee Patrick&rdquo;) reading from their novels of Hollywood, fashion, and murder starring iconic costume designer Edith Head.</p>
