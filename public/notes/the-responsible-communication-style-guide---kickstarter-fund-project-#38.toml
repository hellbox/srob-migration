<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_The Responsible Communication Style Guide_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/961164339/the-responsible-communication-style-guide?ref=category_featured). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Audrey Eschright](http://recompilermag.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
The Responsible Communication Style Guide is a stylebook for writers and other media creators
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	<a href="https://recompilermag.com/" title="The Recompiler | building better technology, together">Recompiler Mag</a> is a feminist hacker magazine, and like many publications, they run into a myriad of style issues. Specifically, they are concerned with proper inclusive language, and the cases where language may exclude or diminish. 
</p>

<p>
	So why not write their own style guide? They're focusing on five areas: race, gender, sexuality, religion, and health and well-being. Each aspect of open communication, and how to present topics in ways that don't exclude people, are considered. 
</p>


<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	Style guides are suggestions (unless you're a language absolutist), and reading suggestions about ways you can be more aware in your writing and tone, especially if you're going for a neutral voice, is never a bad thing. Knowing what language may offend or alienate people you've never thought about can make your work reach a larger audience. And, with the exception of certain politicians, writers, and narrow-minded charlatans, limiting your audience is generally a bad idea. 
	</p>



<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	Ouch! Only 45% there and five days to go. They need help. If you get behind this project, help spread the word!
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
