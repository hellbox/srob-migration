<p>Did you make it to the Seattle Antiquarian Bookfair yesterday? If not, head on down today! They&rsquo;ll be open through 4pm today. Go see rare book and ephemera dealers from around the country, and even from overseas. Lots of amazing finds for book lovers, collectors, and even for looky-loos.</p>

<p>Our thanks to them for their sponsorship over the past three weeks. Partnering with events like this is exactly why we&rsquo;re so excited about our sponsorship model. Go tell them you saw about the fair on the Seattle Review of Books.</p>
