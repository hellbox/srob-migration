<p>We here at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> are incredibly excited for Link Light Rail to open to Capitol Hill and the University District. (Fun fact: light rail opens on the exact same weekend as the <a href="http://www.aprilfestival.com/2016-festival/">APRIL Festival&rsquo;s big book fair at the Hugo House</a>! That&rsquo;s your Sunday, March 20th all sorted for you.) And this video from Sound Transit profiling Seattle cartoonist Ellen Forney is only getting us more excited about launch-day, especially because it&rsquo;s got plenty of footage of the installation of Forney&rsquo;s beautiful illustrations of giant hands in the Capitol Hill station.</p>
