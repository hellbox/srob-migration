* News broke yesterday that author William Trevor passed away. [Literary Hub has a wonderful roundup](http://lithub.com/remembering-william-trevor/) of audio and visual files of Trevor appearances and remembrances of Trevor by other authors.

* Sadly appropriate for our time: [Umberto Eco's list](http://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html) of 14 common features of fascism. Here's number seven:

<blockquote>The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”</blockquote>

* Barnes &  Noble is [opening a smaller concept store in New York](http://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/westchester/eastchester/2016/11/21/barnes-noble-opening-5-things-know/94220606/). It has a large upscale restaurant and books that were "chosen by the store's staff." This is not a rare thing if you shop at independent bookstores, but it's new for Barnes & Noble. Hopefully they'll give their employees more agency in buying for their sections around the chain in the future. This is how you get a bookstore that's actually attuned to its surroundings, rather than airlifted in from a home office.

* This list of comedy cliches that must be retired is great advice for writers:
