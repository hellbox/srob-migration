<p>Human fiction-factory James Patterson has announced that his November title, a mystery titled <em>The Murder of Stephen King</em>, has been canceled. <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2016/09/james-patterson-calls-off-murder-of-stephen-king.html">Jackson McHenry at Vulture writes</a> that Patterson announced the cancellation &ldquo;after deciding that he did not want to cause King and his family &lsquo;any discomfort&rsquo; given that fans have reportedly &lsquo;disrupted the King household in the past.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true; considering that <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,627076,00.html">King has had several stalkers through the years</a>, Patterson&rsquo;s novel, in which a would-be murderer combines the techniques and characteristics of various King antagonists, seems in exceptionally poor taste. I first heard of this book last month, and I naturally assumed that Patterson had gotten permission from King before writing it. That certainly seems like it would have been a wise thing to do.</p>
