<blockquote>The WITS Program Director is responsible for establishing and maintaining high quality writer residencies, creating and managing the program budget, leading development of program strategy, supporting classroom teachers and writers-in-residence throughout the year, stewarding relationships with schools and other program partners, recruiting new schools and writers, program assessment, and collaborating with staff and board members on fundraising, public relations, and marketing as well as general SAL administration.</blockquote>
