<li><p>Next Tuesday, outstanding sci-fi writing organization Clarion West is <a href="https://www.clarionwest.org/brewing-other-worlds/">hosting a reading and open mic at Naked City in Greenwood</a>. First, the open mic will encourage people to share short works, and then local sci-fi authors Randy Henderson, Seanan McGuire, Evan Peterson, and E. Lily Yu take over the stage. Tickets are ten bucks, and it benefits the Clarion West Writers Workshop. I hope you&rsquo;ll consider coming out and supporting emerging sci-fi writers.</p></li>

<li><p>At <a href="http://seattlemag.com/news-and-features/seattle-library-employee-was-stuck-needle-should-branches-make-changes-deal-opioid"><em>Seattle Magazine</em>, Erica C. Barnett wrote</a> about a Seattle Public Library employee who was stuck with a needle in a library bathroom. Unlike other library systems, SPL doesn&rsquo;t provide sharps containers — and for the most maddening reason in the world:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>[SPL Spokesperson Andra] Addison says there’s a simple reason that the library doesn’t provide sharps containers for drug users: “We don’t allow illegal drug use in the library. It’s against our rules of conduct.” Providing sharps containers would be a tacit acknowledgement that people are using drugs at the library in violation of those rules.</blockquote>

<li><p>Okay, look. In a perfect world, nobody would suffer from opioid addiction. But we do not live in a perfect world. This dumb head-in-the-sand policy is endangering our librarians, and SPL needs to reassess their responsibility to their employees immediately. Thanks to Barnett for the great reporting.</p></li>

<li><p>Great news! We <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2018/01/17/tonights-words-west-reading-benefits-one-of-seattles-best-neighborhood-independent-coffee-shops/">told you a couple months back</a> that West Seattle coffeeshop C&amp;P Coffee, home to the Words West readings series, was in danger of closing unless they could raise the funds to save the site from development. <a href="http://westseattleblog.com/2018/03/it-is-a-home-it-is-your-home-c-p-coffee-announces-its-raised-the-money-to-purchase-and-preserve-the-coffee-house/">They have successfully raised the money</a>, which means C&amp;P isn&rsquo;t going anywhere. Thanks to all who helped.</p></li>
