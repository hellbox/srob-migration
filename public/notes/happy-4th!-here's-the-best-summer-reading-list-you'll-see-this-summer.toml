First of all: we at the *Seattle Review of Books* would like to wish you a happy 4th of July! Here's some Sousa for you:

Now: we're taking the day off, but we don't want to leave you in the lurch for summer reading, so we thought we'd share [Queen Anne Book Company's page for the McClure Middle School's summer reading program](http://www.qabookco.com/mcclure-summer-reading). We wish [this was our required reading in 6th grade](http://www.qabookco.com/6th-grade-mcclure-summer-reading). Nothing against *Johnny Tremain*, but the kids at McClure have an amazing mix of comics, sci-fi, and socially engaged literature to choose from. A reading list like this gives us hope for our country's future.
