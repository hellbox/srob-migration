<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>Flipping through my high school yearbook, I was confronted with the uncomfortable reminder that my favorite book in senior year — the book I told everyone they *had* to read — was *Fight Club*.</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>My reading actually got worse after that. In college, I fell hard for Ayn Rand for a semester. And I’m still embarrassed about the way I got suckered into thinking *House of Leaves* was deep.</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>So how do I know that the books I like now are any better? Will I one day be as embarrassed by my love of Jonathan Lethem and Mary Gaitskill as I’m already embarrassed by my teenage admiration for Charles Bukowski? Why is everything I liked ten years ago so awful, and is there a way to shame-proof my next ten years of reading?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Dawson, Bitter Lake</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Dawson,</p>

<p class="noindent">Thank you for bringing up many cringeful memories for me – I still have a few Bukowski poems memorized; I became a nihilist when I first learned the word "nihilist" and put a copy of Nietzsche's *The Antichrist* in my bathroom; it was eventually replaced with a copy of *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* and then the Tom Robbins opus, *Word Porridge Nostalgia*. I should be embarrassed about at least half of those things but I'm not.</p>

<p>The only time I am genuinely embarrassed is when I&rsquo;m wrong and no one has the right to tell either of us our taste in books is wrong, just as my medical school friends don&rsquo;t have the right to tell me a witch doctor is not a real doctor and the pompous OshKoshBGosh-wearing motherfuckers on the message boards at Farmers-Only-Dot-Com don&rsquo;t have the right to tell me a spider farm is not a real farm when SPIDER FARMS EAT ANT FARMS FOR BREAKFAST.</p>

<p>Just because YOU&rsquo;VE never milked a spider doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t be done.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already devoted many words in this column to how much I love judging other people&rsquo;s taste in books. You can turn a timeline of someone&rsquo;s favorite books into a topographical map of how they&rsquo;ve evolved as a person.</p>

<p>If anyone views their own taste in books (or anything else) as perpetually on point, it&rsquo;s a good indication of their personal stagnation – they&rsquo;ve crawled so far up their own ass that they&rsquo;ve gotten lost in the small intestine&rsquo;s labyrinth of bullshit, pitched a tent and are listlessly calling for help with only a well-worn copy of <em>On the Road</em> for company – a book they still refer to as The Great American Novel.</p>

<p>So to answer your question: No, there is no way to shame-proof your reading list other than to stop feeling shame about the things you&rsquo;re interested in reading. So stop it.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
