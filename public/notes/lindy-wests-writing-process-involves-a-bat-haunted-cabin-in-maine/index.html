&ldquo;This is <strong>the weirdest thing that ever happened to me</strong>,&rdquo; Lindy West said from the stage at Town Hall last night after being welcomed by a beyond sold-out room — 1200 people — with thunderous applause. West began by talking a little about the writing of her memoir, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/05/18/talking-with-lindy-west-about-fantasy-novels-deadlines-and-why-seattle-is-her-home/"><em>Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman</em></a>. &ldquo;A book, FYI, is eighty thousand words,&rdquo; she told the room. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of words.&rdquo; And it took months to write, many of which she spent &ldquo;in a bat-haunted cabin in Maine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>West said she was proud of <em>Shrill</em>, that she finds the book to be &ldquo;very, very vulnerable and very personal,&rdquo; and also &ldquo;full of butts and periods.&rdquo; What she wanted in the book, she said, was to represent a woman&rsquo;s life as literature, &ldquo;the way men&rsquo;s lives are presented.&rdquo; She said she&rsquo;s read plenty of &ldquo;day-to-day experiences of men in literature, and it&rsquo;s been great,&rdquo; but women should be afforded that same kind of representation. Later in the evening, she added that a lot of men online seem to be very upset about the idea of women wanting to be represented, that they argue the fight for representation was pointless. &ldquo;If representation doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; West responded, &ldquo;<strong>why won&rsquo;t you fucking let go of it?</strong>&ldquo;</p>

<p>After West read the first chapter of <em>Shrill</em>, the question and answer session mostly involved people seeking advice. How do we convince men to read the stories of women? West replied that everyone should &ldquo;raise your young baby sons to read books about girls.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s the best way to fight back against trolls? West said she used to believe that it was important to &ldquo;talk back on Twitter,&rdquo; but lately she&rsquo;s been feeling less inclined to enagage with them. She added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really into the trend of [sites with] no comments sections.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When asked about how she came to share some of the most personal parts of <em>Shrill</em>, West was clear about the fact that she still has boundaries. And she wanted young writers to know that it&rsquo;s okay to have boundaries of their own. &ldquo;There is a writing culture that encourages, especially, young women to <strong>sell their deepest traumas for fifty dollars</strong> and I would encourage them to not do that.&rdquo; Almost as soon as West said that, she said she regretted saying it, because she didn&rsquo;t want to tell young writers what to do. If they <em>wanted</em> to share their story, that&rsquo;s fine, she said, but if they felt alarm bells going off as they turned their memories into writing, they should pay attention to the internal warning. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to give everything away to be a good writer, or even a good confessional writer,&rdquo; West said.</p>

<p>A lot of the questions had to do with her writing process. West&rsquo;s answers were decidedly not practiced, which seemed to make them more meaningful for the crowd. She said she still pores through <em>Shrill</em> wondering, &ldquo;was that the best sentence I&rsquo;ve ever written or the worst sentence anyone has ever written?&rdquo; She also said that it took a long time to acknowledge that &ldquo;me in my underwear at five AM eating Swedish fish and crying&rdquo; was a natural part of the writing process. But once she accepted that, things got a lot easier. Her words seemed to encourage the aspiring authors who came to see her, and they all offered words of praise before their questions — &rdquo;I read the book and I fucking loved it,&rdquo; someone said. It was the kind of hometown crowd reading that every author should hope for: a giant, loving room full of people who came not out of obligation, but out of love. That crowd left with the sense that West loved them back. Readings don&rsquo;t get any more meaningful than that.</p>
