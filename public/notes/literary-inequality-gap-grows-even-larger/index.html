<p><a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/01/slow-death-literary-novel-sales-crisis-afflicting-fiction"><em>The New Statesman</em> reports</a> that it&rsquo;s getting harder than ever to make a living as a novelist in Great Britain:</p>

<blockquote>In today’s market, selling 3,000 copies of your novel is not unrespectable – but factor in the average hardback price of £10.12 and the retailer’s 50 per cent cut, and just £15,000 remains to share between publisher, agent and author. No wonder that the percentage of authors earning a full-time living solely from writing dropped from 40 per cent in 2005 to 11.5 per cent in 2013.</blockquote>

<p>Barring the few true literary superstars, writers have always needed a side hustle just to get by. But an abundance of publishing options has left most writers with a smaller share of the pie, and money doesn&rsquo;t go as far anymore.</p>

<p>The truth is, this is less of a publishing story and more of an economic inequality story. A true and just society would allow more citizens to follow their dreams — and not just if their dreams involve making some shitty app that sells advertising on the back of a huge user base. Until we fix these problems, it&rsquo;s not going to get any easier to make a living through following your dreams.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, we&rsquo;re talking about economic inequality in next month&rsquo;s Reading Through It Book Club at Third Place Books Seward Park. We&rsquo;ll be discussing Robert Reich&rsquo;s cartoon guidebook to economics, <em>Economics in Wonderland</em>, which is published by Seattle&rsquo;s own Fantagraphics Books. If you want to get a basic understanding of the forces that are making everything shittier for everyone, you should <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/382566692170310/">RSVP on Facebook</a> and then drop by.</p>
