<p><strong>Podcast #1</strong>: <a href="http://www.0s-1s.com/the-art-of-commerce-xxxiii">The Art of Commerce</a> talked with Third Place Books managing partner Robert Sindelar about the pleasures and problems of running a bookstore. (If you&rsquo;re wondering, the Seward Park Third Place Books is still scheduled to open early in 2016.)</p>

<p><strong>Podcast #2</strong> I talked with Brad Craft and Nick DiMartino for <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ubookstore/breakfast-at-the-bookstore-50">the 50th episode of their delightful Breakfast at the Bookstore podcast</a>. We discussed the importance of criticism, what we&rsquo;ve been reading lately, and why Martin McClellan and I started the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>.</p>
