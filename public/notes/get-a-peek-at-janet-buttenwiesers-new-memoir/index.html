<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1521243372974/GUTS_150.jpeg" alt="" /></p>Published barely a month ago, local writer Janet Buttenwieser&rsquo;s memoir <em>GUTS</em> is perfectly in season. The story of her double loss — a significant hit to her health, the devastating loss of a friend — <em>GUTS</em> is about persistence, resilience, and renewal, a few things we all need right now. It&rsquo;s also about that most Seattle-y sport possible, the triathlon, and using physical endurance to endure emotional challenges. And it&rsquo;s a delight to read: clear, funny, self-reflective.</p>

<p>Hop over to <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/">our sponsorship page</a> and check out the prologue, which Janet has generously shared with our readers this week. And join her <strong>at Elliott Bay Books on March 31</strong>, when she takes the stage with fellow Seattle7Writers Sorting Room Residents.
