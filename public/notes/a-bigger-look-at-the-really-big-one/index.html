<p>While everyone in Seattle is currently freaking out about <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one">Kathryn Schulz&rsquo;s excellent <em>New Yorker</em> article</a> detailing how we we&rsquo;re overdue for an impossibly bad earthquake, I&rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to remind you to read Sandi Doughton&rsquo;s excellent <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781570619427"><em>Full-Rip 9.0: The Next Big Earthquake in the Pacific Northwest</em></a>. Doughton gets into detail that the <em>New Yorker</em> simply doesn&rsquo;t have room for, explaining all the various fault lines and different kinds of earthquakes that could strike Seattle in specific and the Pacific Northwest in general. It&rsquo;s an excellent book that will leave Seattleites stricken with insomnia for days.</p>
