<p>Long shot prairie<br>
Long shot wolf</p>

<p>Long shot girl<br>
Long shot deer</p>

<p>Long shot dog<br>
Close-up shot little monkey</p>

<p>My dear sweetheart,<br>
Where does the North begin?</p>

<p>Wolfang, Fang, Flash and Flame</p>

<p>My darling cotton wooly hotel<br>
A tiny house is expensive<br>
At the edge of the sea</p>

<p>What is happiness, Love?</p>

<p>My dear sweetheart&mdash;<br>
HUNGRY WOLVES SURROUND THE CAMP</p>
