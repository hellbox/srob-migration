<p>November is fast approaching, which means it&rsquo;s time for <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a>. Our own advice columnist, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/cienna-madrid/">Cienna Madrid</a>, is no novice when it comes to NaNoWriMo, and so she&rsquo;d like to offer up her column for writing advice for the entire month of November.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask Cienna any questions about the process of writing (Do you have a character who&rsquo;s just not doing what she&rsquo;s supposed to do? Does your dialogue sound like it&rsquo;s been crafted out of cheap tin?) and about the etiquette of writing. (Should your loved ones be jealous that you&rsquo;re reserving a couple hours a day to write all November long?) She&rsquo;s looking forward to helping you write 50,000 pain-free words in the month of November. Send your questions to <strong>advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com</strong>.</p>
