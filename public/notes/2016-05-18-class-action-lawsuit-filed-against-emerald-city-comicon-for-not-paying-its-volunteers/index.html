        <p>Our friends at <a href="http://seattlish.com/post/144561926396/someone-is-suing-emerald-city-comicon-for-not">Seattlish just broke the story</a> of a class-action lawsuit filed against the owners of Emerald City Comicon for not paying their volunteers. (ECCC officially calls its volunteers &ldquo;minions,&rdquo; which is not a very good look; ECCC vendors and talent have complained to us about how &ldquo;demeaning&rdquo; that title is on multiple occasions.) Seattlish explains:</p>

<blockquote>According to the suit, the volunteers are expected to work essentially as paid workers would — performing functions necessary to the operation of the convention — but aren’t required to be paid for their labor or their overtime due to their volunteer status.</blockquote>

<p>Seattlish notes that minions &ldquo;willingly enter into an agreement stating that they’ll work for free,&rdquo; but, as ECCC is a for-profit business, this means the volunteer status could legally be interpreted as nebulous. It&rsquo;s a stretch, but these volunteer positions might be perceived as similar enough to unpaid internships to make things tricky for ECCC; in recent years the federal government has been (rightfully) cracking down on abuse of unpaid internships by for-profit businesses. This story is a very big deal, and Seattlish will be all over the suit as it progresses. We&rsquo;ll keep you posted.</p>
