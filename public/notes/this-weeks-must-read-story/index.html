<p>Everybody&rsquo;s talking about Mira Jacob&rsquo;s BuzzFeed story &ldquo;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mirajacob/you-will-ignore-us-at-your-own-peril#.qbMn2g022">I Gave A Speech About Race To The Publishing Industry And No One Heard Me</a>,&rdquo; and for good reason: it&rsquo;s a substantial look at one of the publishing industry&rsquo;s biggest problems. Jacob was invited to be the keynote speaker at a <em>Publisher&rsquo;s Weekly</em> gathering:</p>

<blockquote>My last year has been intense. My book *The Sleepwalker’s Guide to Dancing* came out, I spent a few months touring internationally, and from a distance, it looked like one big party. Up close, it looked a bit different. This was something I really wanted to get into, as sometimes when we talk about the [sad statistics](http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/176705/why-88-of-books-reviewed-by-the-new-york-times-are-written-by-white-authors/) facing writers of color in publishing, they become just that: statistics. I wanted to back that up by talking about what it actually looks like.</blockquote>

<p>The speech did not go well; the sound system rolled over and died, so Jacob had to stand on a chair and shout her speech. Most people in the room — especially most white people in the room — didn&rsquo;t hear her. And this was a room that really needed to hear what Jacob had to say. If you haven&rsquo;t already, you <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mirajacob/you-will-ignore-us-at-your-own-peril#.qbMn2g022">must read this piece</a>.</p>
