<p>A singular talent, a life-saving artist who constructed a brilliant career, and <a href="http://electricliterature.com/david-bowies-100-favorite-books/">a passionate reader</a>: to call David Bowie one-in-a-million would be to seriously devalue his uniqueness. Maybe he was one-in-a-species, but he made us all feel like we could be better people. There&rsquo;s not a single dud on his top-100 book list, which was found and shared this morning by Lincoln Michel at <a href="http://electricliterature.com/david-bowies-100-favorite-books/">Electric Literature</a>. Also, <a href="https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/list/share/72535308_rainy_day_librarian/571420248_david_bowie_book_list">the Seattle Public Library has put together a list of Bowie-related books</a> for you.
