<p>and sink into her smooth white hollow<br>
run the pads of my hands along<br>
her cool slopes admire the curves<br>
that cradle my naked skin<br>
as the water runs Iâ€™ll stick my toe<br>
into that brass faucet and accept<br>
a spray of water sifting<br>
over my thighs and shins like sugar<br>
the heat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a rising redemption<br>
misty and heaven-bound as water<br>
folds over my hips my belly<br>
the rising and falling of my chest<br>
buoyant with each exhalation this rest<br>
quiet above a porcelain body</p>
