<p>Australian comic and TV writer Tom Taylor <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TomTaylorWriter/posts/1471859196157810">announced last night on Facebook</a> that he&rsquo;s not going to attend Emerald City Comicon this week in Seattle. In fact, he&rsquo;s not coming to the United States at all this year. Why? Well, I&rsquo;ll let him speak for himself:</p>

<blockquote><p>...America, through no fault of most of its citizens, doesn’t feel like a safe or welcoming travel destination at this moment.</p>

<p>There have been reports of interrogation, phone data downloads, requests for social media accounts, returns and five-year travel bans and everyone from children to the elderly being detained. All of this has many people I’ve spoken to reconsidering or cancelling their US travel plans.</p>

<p>I’ve had friends and people I work with suggest I leave my phone at home, or delete my twitter account for a month before I come.</p>

<p>I refuse those terms.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is bad news for Seattle comics fans, but Taylor is doing the right thing here by making his decision public. Remember when Mike Pence promoted a batshit anti-LGBT law in Indiana and then <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3044548/fast-feed/the-companies-that-are-actually-boycotting-indiana-not-just-tweeting-about-it">businesses and performers announced that they were boycotting Indiana</a>? Remember how Pence <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/237471-pence-calls-for-immediate-fix-to-controversial-law">backed down</a>? Boycotts might suck for fans, but sometimes boycotts work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d advise comics fans to get used to this kind of post; I bet we&rsquo;ll be seeing more of them in the months and years to come.</p>
