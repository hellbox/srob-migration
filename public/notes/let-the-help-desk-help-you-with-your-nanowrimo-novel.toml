November is fast approaching, which means it's time for [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/). Our own advice columnist, [Cienna Madrid](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/cienna-madrid/), is no novice when it comes to NaNoWriMo, and so she'd like to offer up her column for writing advice for the entire month of November.

Feel free to ask Cienna any questions about the process of writing (Do you have a character who's just not doing what she's supposed to do? Does your dialogue sound like it's been crafted out of cheap tin?) and about the etiquette of writing. (Should your loved ones be jealous that you're reserving a couple hours a day to write all November long?) She's looking forward to helping you write 50,000 pain-free words in the month of November. Send your questions to **advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com**.
