We love Greenwood's literary tutoring center [The Bureau of Fearless Ideas](http://fearlessideas.org/about/about-bfi/) (formerly known as 826 Seattle) and we are big fans of [this Facebook post demonstrating a recent student experiment in creating illuminated manuscripts](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153508339199890.1073741869.53145114889&type=3). It seems as though, with the general-interest acceptance of comic books, we're about due for an illuminated manuscript resurgence. Maybe one of these kids will lead the charge.
