<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday, January 9: *The Doomsday Machine* Reading**</h5></p>
Daniel Ellsberg is, flat-out, one of the greatest American heroes of the last hundred years. His bravery in exposing the Pentagon Papers should have earned him a monument in Washington DC, but perhaps he is just supposed to feel grateful for the fact that he hasn’t spent his entire adult life rotting in prison. In any case, Ellsberg is in town reading from his new book, *The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner*. Given that our president tweets unhinged things about our nuclear arsenal at weird hours of the day, this seems like an especially relevant book right now. *University Temple,  1415 NE 43rd St,634-3400, http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/, 7 pm, $5*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday, January 11: *The Immortalists* Reading**</h5></p>
Author Chloe Benjamin’s latest novel, *The Immortalists*, is about a mystical prophecy that foretells death. It’s a clever addition to the genre of fiction based around the primal thought experiment centered around what you would do if you knew the exact date and time of your death.
