<p>KING 5&rsquo;s <em>New Day NW</em> interviewed local writers Anca Szilagyi and Erin Malone about the very worthy <a href="http://www.jackstraw.org/programs/writers/WritersForum/">Jack Straw Writers Program</a>. (I&rsquo;d embed the video here, but in my experience KING 5&rsquo;s video viewer tends to make websites shiver, roll over, and die. You&rsquo;re better off just <a href="http://www.king5.com/story/entertainment/television/programs/new-day-northwest/2015/08/05/jack-straw-writers-program-fellowships/31157987/">clicking through and viewing it on their own site</a>.) The interview also discusses Hugo House, and it promotes a Jack Straw reading that happens tonight at <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/jack-straw-writers-group-reading-emily-bedard-laura-da%E2%80%99-erin-malone-matthew-schnirman">Elliott Bay Book Company</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll admit to being happily flabbergasted; I can&rsquo;t recall the last time a local TV news show has focused on a writing program. <strong>Fine work, KING 5!</strong> More like this please.</p>
