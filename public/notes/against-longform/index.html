<p>Alex Balk <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2016/02/words-bad-2">at The Awl published a brief post</a> against longform nonfiction storytelling. Here&rsquo;s a quote from the piece, which I think gets the point across with even more brevity: &ldquo;Are there some stories so intricate that they actually demand tens of thousands of words to tell them? Sure. Maybe six or seven a year. Everything else you read is padding or awards-bait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s purposefully incendiary stuff, and obviously a broad generalization. Personally, I tend to prize pieces of a certain length; here at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>, we rarely publish reviews that are shorter than a thousand words, because we think anything less tends to fully fail to develop an idea. I recently wrote a piece for the site that was over three thousand words, but I hope to cut it down a little bit in the editing process.</p>

<p>But in general, I tend to agree with Balk; I&rsquo;ve read a lot of longform pieces that have wasted my time. I&rsquo;m fine with digressions and taking your time to tell a story, but a story should be exactly as long as it needs to be. We&rsquo;ve all read magazine articles that have been puffed out to book-length; we all agree that those are terrible. When that happens, we feel manipulated, and it sours the reading experience. Same with longform. That said, I am always in favor of more writers writing more, and if longform is the vessel that gets readers in front of writing, that&rsquo;s a-okay with me.</p>

<p>But rather than arguing about a nonexistent perfect metric for exactly how long a piece should be, I&rsquo;d rather everyone read <a href="http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2016/02/18/scream-it-until-their-ears-bleed-pay-the-fucking-writers/">this great post by Chuck Wendig</a> about why paying writers is so important. It&rsquo;s titled &ldquo;<a href="http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2016/02/18/scream-it-until-their-ears-bleed-pay-the-fucking-writers/">Scream It Until Their Ears Bleed: Pay the Fucking Writers</a>,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s in response to an idiotic Huffington Post editor&rsquo;s bullshit claims that paying writers is &ldquo;not a real authentic way of presenting copy,&rdquo; that because Huffington Post bloggers write out of passion, their writing somehow has more merit. I don&rsquo;t know how many words Wendig&rsquo;s post is, but I can tell you it&rsquo;s exactly as long as it should be.</p>
