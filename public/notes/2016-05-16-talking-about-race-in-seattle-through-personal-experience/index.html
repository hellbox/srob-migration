        <p>Sponsor Lisa Richesson has an incredible story to tell in her book <em>White Lady, Black Sons</em>, one that explains Seattle&rsquo;s racist past through her direct experience. Lisa, a white woman, had two children with a black man. One, when she was a teenager, was put up for adoption.</p>

<p>The first chapter of the book, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">which you can read on our Sponsor&rsquo;s page</a>, goes back even earlier to the first time she became aware of race, and just what happened in her cloistered white Catholic community when she became friends with a young black girl. It&rsquo;s a gripping story &mdash; read that chapter, and we think you&rsquo;ll agree, and want to know more.</p>

<p>We have only <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">four sponsor slots left</a>, before August. If you&rsquo;re a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">take a look at our open dates</a>. We&rsquo;d love to talk to you about opportunities to sponsor us. It&rsquo;s our way of making internet advertising something to look forward to.</p>
