<p>Over <a href="https://thesmartset.com/always-a-critic/">at The Smart Set</a>, Paula Marantz Cohen wrote a terrific piece about how one negative book review — written by Norman Mailer — changed the course of a friendship and a career.</p>

<blockquote>If the personal is political, as the ’60s activists used to say, the political is, even more, inherently personal.
