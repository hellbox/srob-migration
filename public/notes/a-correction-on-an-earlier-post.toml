Due to a filing error, we mistakenly attributed a poem by a different poet to Jane Wong. The mistake was entirely ours, and we have deleted the post from the site and social media. We apologize to Jane Wong for the egregious mistake, and to our readers, and we’ll put procedures in place to ensure it won’t happen again.
