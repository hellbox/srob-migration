<p>The APRIL Festival — it stands for Authors, Publishers, and Readers of Independent Literature — just <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/april-2016#/">launched a fundraising drive</a> for their 2016 festival. A tremendous cast of local literary all-stars has put together a video for the project:</p>

<p>This is a worthy cause. APRIL puts on a number of events — most of which are free — featuring a diverse array of artists. You should think about donating what you can. Even ten bucks would help, although if you can spring for $25, APRIL co-founder Willie Fitzgerald will make you your very own literary meme. Really, who wouldn&rsquo;t want one of these bad boys?</p>
