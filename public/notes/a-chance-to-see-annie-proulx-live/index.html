<p class="noindent">The UW Libraries' "Literary Voices" celebration is a great event on May 3rd — a dinner where every table is filled with local authors, and the amazing Annie Proulx, author of _The Shipping News_, _Barkskins_, and the short story "Brokeback Mountain", will be delivering the keynote.</p>

<p>Best of all, it&rsquo;s a fundraiser, so your money goes directly into paying for student employee scholarships. As any library nerd knows, UW&rsquo;s library system is vast, comprehensive, and unparalleled. <a href="http://events.uw.edu/events/literary-voices/event-summary-307553ee6d7c4f30b873748baef64f51.aspx" title="Literary Voices - Event Summary | Online Registration by Cvent">Tickets are easy to get, both for individual tickets, and for buying a table to invite all your friends</a> to come support the amazing work done in this vital cultural and educational institutions.
