<p>April is National Poetry Month. While for many readers and lovers of poetry this means a bit more time than normal looking through the pages of your favorite chapbook, and lingering in the well-stocked poetry sections of Seattle&rsquo;s many indie bookstores (the best-stocked, of course, being the <a href="http://www.openpoetrybooks.com">store that is made up entirely of poetry</a>), if you&rsquo;re a poet (or would like to become a poet), April offers you a compelling challenge: it&rsquo;s also National Poetry Writing Month.</p>

<p>National Poetry Writing Month, or <a href="http://www.napowrimo.net/">NaPoWriMo</a> (after the better known National Novel Writing Month, <a href="https://nanowrimo.org" title="National Novel Writing Month">NaNoWriMo</a>), has a simple idea: write one poem each day in April. Some participants choose to post their daily output on their blogs, but there&rsquo;s no requirement to share. Just write a poem each day, and you&rsquo;re participating. Even if you never tell anybody. Even if you keep it close to your chest.</p>

<p>Today being April 3rd may be a convenient excuse to not start, after all, you&rsquo;ve already missed two days. But consider writing anyway: if you end the month with 28 poems, you&rsquo;re 28 poems ahead of where you were at the start of April. During the month, you may just find the inspiration to write two extra, in any case.</p>

<p>Kelli Russell Agodon, local poet, and <a href="http://www.twosylviaspress.com/" title="Home">cofounder/editor of Two Sylvias Press</a>, had some sage advice for NaPoWriMo participants on her Twitter feed (make sure to click through and <a href="https://twitter.com/KelliAgodon/status/980542399469334528">read the whole thread</a>).</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1) Set a timer for 15 minutes.  Tell yourself, <em>This is ALL the time I get and I have to write something.</em> Even if it&#39;s not good or long, you have 15 minutes. I&#39;m always amused how I write some of my best poems because I know I need to get somewhere.</p>&mdash; Kelli Russell Agodon (@KelliAgodon) <a href="https://twitter.com/KelliAgodon/status/980542399469334528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 1, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that we here at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> are poetry lovers. We&rsquo;ve been publishing poetry each week since our launch, first individual poems in a chain of poets recommending other poets, then starting in 2017 with a Poet in Residence project. If you&rsquo;re looking for inspiration, or good reading, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/tuesday-poem/" title="The Seattle Review of Books">look at our archives</a>.</p>

<p>There are a million topics worth writing about in our bustling and growing city. Someday, maybe we&rsquo;ll get to read a poem that started during this April. We can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
