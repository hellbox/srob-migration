<p>The tulle veil<br>
was bone china<br>
white and thin.<br>
A breakable wisp.</p>

<p>It was fleeting.<br>
Mother snapped<br>
shots of it<br>
on Sundays.</p>

<p>I sat in the family<br>
rocking chair<br>
in the unused room<br>
with ankles crossed.</p>

<p>Swirl feel<br>
under the skirt<br>
of my church dress.<br>
It lived there.</p>

<p>A lace sash<br>
tied off<br>
access to<br>
the pure me.</p>

<p>My holiness<br>
sewn<br>
delicate<br>
as an eyelet.</p>
