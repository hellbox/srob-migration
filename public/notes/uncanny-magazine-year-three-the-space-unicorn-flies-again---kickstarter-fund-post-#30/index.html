<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Uncanny Magazine Year Three: The Space Unicorn Flies Again!_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lynnemthomas/uncanny-magazine-year-three-the-space-unicorn-flie/description). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Lynne M. Thomas](http://lynnemthomas.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>A Professional Magazine of Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Good anthologies make the SF world go round, and with two successful years behind them &mdash; including a Hugo Award Finalist nod for best semi-pro zine &mdash; Lynne M. Thomas and Michael Damian Thomas put together a good planet spin. 
</p>

<p>The list of authors, short stories, nonfiction, poetry, and art, is impressive, and includes Seattle alumni Maria Dahvana Headley, among the many others.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Because there's something remarkably unique about a SF anthology. Finding new authors to love, exploring ideas where writers are willing to take big chances, finding out the power of good editing in situ. Back it because the odds are, you'll find something you love in there, and isn't that worth the price of admission?
</p>
