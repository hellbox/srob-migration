        <p>David Ferguson at <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2017/01/harper-collins-pulling-plagiarist-trump-nominee-monica-crowleys-book-from-shelves/">Raw Story</a> writes:</p>

<blockquote>Andrew Kaczynski of CNN’s KFiles announced Tuesday on Twitter that [Trump transition team member Monica] Crowley’s 2012 book — an anti-Obama screed titled *What the (Bleep) Just Happened?: The Happy Warrior’s Guide to the Great American Comeback* — has “reached the end of its natural sales cycle,” according to Harper Collins, “and will no longer be available for purchase until such time as the author has the opportunity to source and revise the material.”</blockquote>

<p>Crowley found her fame as an associate of Richard Nixon at the very end of his life. She wrote two interesting books about Nixon — <em>Nixon Off the Record</em> being the better of the two — but her writing career is probably finished for the forseeable future. She&rsquo;s still a part of Trump&rsquo;s incoming team, though, because none of the standard rules of civility and morality seem to matter anymore. Happy Tuesday!</p>
