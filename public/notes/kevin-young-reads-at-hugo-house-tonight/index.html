<p>I just want to call your attention to what should be a magnificent book event tonight. Poet Kevin Young is <a href="https://hugohouse.org/event/kevin-young-on-throwing-your-voice/">giving a craft talk at the Hugo House</a> starting at 7 pm. Young is one of the very best American poets; his last collection, <em>Book of Hours</em>, destroyed me with its raw depiction of grief. It&rsquo;s one of the best collections I&rsquo;ve read in recent memory. (You can <a href="https://medium.com/@paulconstant/a-total-loss-f46831d8dece#.khy2ukre5">read my review here</a>.) In addition, Young is being interviewed by Jane Wong, the excellent local poet whose <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/29/apology-in-the-age-of-construction/">work has appeared</a> on the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> on <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/13/spoiled/">more than one occasion</a>. This should be a night to remember.</p>
