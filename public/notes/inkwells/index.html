<p>From the first day, the teacher wrote as she spoke. An inkwell was a hole<br>
without words, on the desk, which was like a pasture, leaving me free to think.<br>
I could not repair my cursive with my pen or with my breath on the window pane. <br>
The inkwells were filled from a large bottle of ink kept in the teacher’s closet.<br>
My mother was disgusted by the inkwells, and by how I was forbidden to write<br>
a letter to a friend. Was I the only one who found inkwells in the picture book?<br>
The older boys sanded wood into serpents with claws, and filled the inkwells.<br>
To my surprise, the words were more brown than black in my notebook.<br>
Birds are called quills, when used. I could see the globe and the squares of Palmer<br>
Method, encircling the room like wallpaper. The rustlings under my pen traveled far,<br>
the faintest murmur. The word “recess” was next. In his lunch pail, the boy beside me<br>
discovered a meal of cold potatoes. I felt the embarrassment of hooking the lunch pail<br>
through my fingers. Weird tether. To make a ball, each of us brought some string<br>
from home. We tried to dip the string into our inkwells. The teacher called out<br>
positions to get into, such as a hawk. I saw my score. Woebegone, so much to do.<br>
I positioned myself like a startled hare. Our desks sloped, and there was a groove<br>
for our pencils and pens. The serpent of our script crawled off the page.</p>
