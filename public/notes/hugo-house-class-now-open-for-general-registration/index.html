<p>As <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/11/putting-the-you-in-book-review/">Paul previously mentioned</a>, we&rsquo;re teaching a class at Hugo House about book reviewing. We&rsquo;ve already met a few nice folks who have signed up, and we&rsquo;d love it if you were there as well.</p>

<p>Registration for Hugo House members was open a week ago, but <a href="https://hugohouse.org/store/class/the-you-review-of-books-paul-constant-and-martin-mcclellan/">now anybody can sign up</a>. We&rsquo;re going to have a lot of fun in this class &mdash; you&rsquo;ll walk away with a deep understanding of reviewing, and with a number of finished reviews on books you feel passionately about.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re making no secret of the fact that we&rsquo;re hoping to find future reviewers for this site, and what better way than to teach you everything we know? Please join us.</p>
