Judge Neil Gorsuch, in his Supreme Court nomination hearings today, [quoted David Foster Wallace's most famous commencement speech](http://blog.acton.org/archives/92657-judge-gorsuch-the-rule-of-law-and-david-foster-wallaces-fish.html) to explain the ubiquity of law. (It's kind of a dumb and basic interpretation of the speech, if you ask me, but whatever.) Justice Antonin Scalia was [also a DFW fan](http://www.businessinsider.com/scalia-likes-david-foster-wallace-2012-11). What's the connection between conservative judges and the work of David Foster Wallace? It must the tennis, right? Yeah, it's gotta be the tennis.

UPDATE: Oh my God. Is nothing sacred?
