<p>Patti Smith talks about her new book <em>M Train</em> <a href="https://townhallseattle.org/event/patti-smith/">this Sunday at Town Hall</a>. It’s sold out. If you didn’t get tickets, perhaps you could listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7xg7u99lilTCPbaRfnYuy6"><em>Horses</em></a> on repeat while watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0256342/"><em>Robert Having His Nipple Pierced</em></a>. We do love Patti Smith.</p>
