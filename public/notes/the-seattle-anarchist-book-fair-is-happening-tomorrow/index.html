<p>Tomorrow, the Vera Project hosts <a href="http://seattleanarchistbookfair.net/">the Seattle Anarchist Book Fair</a> from 10 am to 5 pm. You&rsquo;ll find over 30 tables of publishers, bookstores, magazines, and more, featuring novels and zines and cookbooks and probably board games, too. (Right? Everyone has board games nowadays.)
