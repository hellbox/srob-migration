We're always happy to see Seattle writers doing great things and spreading the Northwest gospel elsewhere, but, boy, this stings a little bit:

Congratulations, Elissa Washuta! We hope you'll sit with us for an Exit Interview to talk about what you'll miss (and what you won't miss) about Seattle. (And if you don't know Washuta's work, you can find her author page — including everything we've ever written about her — [right here](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/authors/elissa-washuta/).)
