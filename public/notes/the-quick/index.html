<p>Taking my knife to the sharpener</p>

<p>I had to ask my brother</p>

<p>how do I take a knife</p>

<p>to the sharpener</p>

<p>one chance not to ruin</p>

<p>the flesh of this tuna I wanted</p>

<p>to separate the head</p>

<p>and dissolve the eye into</p>

<p>powder on my tongue I said</p>

<p>something about a fire worried</p>

<p>about dying in a fire in this club</p>

<p>with these people she said</p>

<p>“Where I come from that isn’t funny”</p>

<p>meaning Rhode Island</p>

<p>but we were in a rented house</p>

<p>on the Oregon Coast</p>

<p>my teeth coated in the dark</p>

<p>with anti-fungal ointment</p>

<p>the label warned CALL</p>

<p>POISON CONTROL and I</p>

<p>did I was redirected</p>

<p>to the nearest call center</p>

<p>the operator asked</p>

<p>where I was in Maine</p>

<p>outside the Pacific recycled</p>

<p>its emergency she said</p>

<p>“Be calm, hon, you’re not</p>

<p>even the first one today</p>

<p>if you die today</p>

<p>it won’t be from this”</p>

<p>was her promise</p>

<p>breaking over a marsh</p>

<p>where cranes showed off</p>

<p>standing on one leg to touch</p>

<p>their toes or talons or whatever</p>

<p>a man walked by reeking</p>

<p>of gasoline and as he passed</p>

<p>the gasoline stayed</p>

<p>a woman stepped backwards</p>

<p>from her porch seeking</p>

<p>a stable place to lean the ladder</p>

<p>she climbed swinging</p>

<p>one leg over the gutter</p>

<p>to disappear</p>

<p>think of it this way:</p>

<p>throughout history the horse</p>

<p>has been an emblem of speed</p>

<p>even on occasion an emblem</p>

<p>of flight and to travel</p>

<p>with any quickness at all</p>

<p>meant trust in an animal</p>

<p>velocity which always arrives</p>

<p>with its cousin</p>

<p>a vision of sudden death</p>

<p>though when it comes to that</p>

<p>all anyone will talk about is the bees.</p>
