<p class="noindent">Well, you rendered [Northwest Associated Arts'](http://nwassociatedarts.org/) sponsorship useless by buying all the tickets to their Neil Gaiman event, so they kindly donated this week's sponsorship to a good cause: [Gay City](https://www.gaycity.org).</p>

<p>Did you know that Gay City has a <a href="https://www.gaycity.org/library/">7,000 volume library</a> centered around LGBT interest and focus? Please consider <a href="https://www.gaycity.org/donate/">donating to Gay City</a> to support their important mandate for supporting LGBT culture and health in our city.</p>

<p>Sponsors like Northwest Associated Arts make the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> possible. Did you know you could sponsor us, as well? Get your stories, or novel, or event in front of our passionate audience. Take a glance at <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/">our sponsorship information page</a> for dates and details.</p>
