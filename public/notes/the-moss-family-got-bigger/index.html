<p>The introductory letter in <a href="http://www.mosslit.com/vol02/issue05.html">the brand-new 5th issue of the online literary magazine <em>Moss</em></a> begins, &ldquo;our team has grown substantially since our last release,&rdquo; welcoming &ldquo;five new contributing editors.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not readily apparent when reading the issue, which feels like the issues that have come before, but that&rsquo;s what you want in a staff expansion: unless your publication is suffering an existential crisis, editorial shifts are generally best felt only subtly.</p>

<p>So the format of this issue of <em>Moss</em> is very familiar: an interview with Portland writer Mitchell S. Jackson about regionalism and gentrification, fiction from Leyna Krow and Sonya Chung, non-fiction from Tiffany Midge and Leah Sottile â€” the latter of whom contributed a moving meditation on love and death. All for the impossibly low price of free. <a href="http://www.mosslit.com/vol02/issue05.html">Go spend some time with the new issue</a>.</p>
