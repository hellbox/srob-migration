<p>Alan LaMont, the owner of Ballard&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LaMontArtsLLC/">The Grumpy Old Man&rsquo;s Comics, Art, and Collectibles</a> doesn&rsquo;t come across as a grumpy old man. He&rsquo;s downright chipper, in fact, and he&rsquo;s got the youthful vigor and charm of someone who&rsquo;s finally living a life he&rsquo;s been dreaming about for decades.</p>

<p>After years &ldquo;working in corporate America&rdquo; in Rochester New York and dreaming of the Pacific Northwest, LaMont finally moved to Seattle on Labor Day of 2017. He brought his enormous, high-quality comics collection - about 200 boxes - along with him, and he set about fulfilling another longtime dream: opening a comic shop/art gallery. LaMont has some experience working in a gallery, and he&rsquo;s attended comics conventions his whole life, but he&rsquo;d never owned a space before. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to work for a company anymore,&rdquo; LaMont says, &ldquo;so I thought I&rsquo;d combine the two things that I love.&rdquo; The store officially opened on the day after Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>LaMont is an artist. He paints as a hobby, but he has primarily worked in linocut art since he was 12. (A whole wall at Grumpy Old Man&rsquo;s Comics displays his work for sale.) He likes the way linocut changes his thought process: in order to create good prints &ldquo;you have to think mirrored and positive-to-negative.&rdquo; It took him a long time to get into the mindset of a linocut artist, but now &ldquo;I have a clear thought process.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That explains the gallery part, but why a comic book store? &ldquo;I learned how to read on comics,&rdquo; LaMont explains. His grandmother was a teacher, and when she noticed his love of superhero cartoons, she bought him a batch of comics and helped him work through them. &ldquo;She had me reading at four years of age,&rdquo; LaMont says. He&rsquo;s been reading comics ever since.</p>

<p>Grumpy Old Man&rsquo;s Comics is located right off Market Street. The shop is split into three distinct rooms. When you walk in, you&rsquo;re standing in the middle of the room with new and recent comics. To your left is a room of classic and collectible comics, ranging all the way back to the 1960s. And to the right is the gallery, with affordable prints and a rotating display of artists. The shop is an eager participant in both <a href="http://www.visitballard.com/artwalk/">Ballard Art Walk</a>, on the second Saturday of the month, and  <a href="https://www.ballardnightout.com/">Ballard Night Out</a> every third Thursday.</p>

<p>LaMont is thrilled with the response the comics side of the business has seen since he opened. When he started the shop, LaMont says, &ldquo;I was thinking that probably the artwork side of it would be the easier sell of the two, and that it would take a while to get my comic book business built up. It&rsquo;s proven to be the opposite,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The comics are already on the verge of carrying the business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grumpy Old Man&rsquo;s offers discounts of up to 30 percent for subscribers, and LaMont is developing a regular clientele. Some of the new subscribers are likely orphans of Seattle comics-shop attrition: Ballard hasn&rsquo;t had a comics shop since Arcane Comics moved to Shoreline a couple years ago, and downtown&rsquo;s Zanadu Comics closed last month.</p>

<p>LaMont wants curious Seattleites to know that Grumpy Old Man&rsquo;s is &ldquo;a rather eclectic mix of things, not a typical comics store and not a typical art gallery.&rdquo; To draw in more new customers, the store is having a sizable back issue sale on Saturday, March 31st from 10 am to 6 pm. There&rsquo;s something for everyone in the shop: LaMont is creating a space where different styles of art - disparate styles that fifty years ago would have been dismissed as &ldquo;low&rdquo; and lauded as &ldquo;high&rdquo; - can live under the same roof.</p>
