Our thanks to this week's sponsor Entre Ríos Books. Their first release _Twelve Saints_ is a beautifully done collaboration between poet Knox Gardner and artist Nia Michaels. 

[On our sponsor page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships "The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships"), we're featuring the "Saint Catherine of Alexandria" with her matching image. It's a real treat, and we think you're going to love it. 

They're throwing a book release party this Thursday &mdash; [look at the sponsor page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships "The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships") for more information. 

Entre Ríos Books is part of the solution &mdash; they're partnering with us to make i[nternet advertising 100% less terrible](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/). You could get your work in front of our readers, too. [We'd love to have you](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/ "The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books").
