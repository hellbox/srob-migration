<p>We&rsquo;re sponsored this week by a very unique book, by a very unique Seattle writer. Esther Altshul Helfgott kept a journal full of insight and poetry, as Alzheimer&rsquo;s first showed its affects in her husband Abe. Her book <em>Dear Alzheimer&rsquo;s</em> is a startling, humane, and insightful look into a difficult time.</p>

<p>You may know Helfgott from her long standing (25 years!) writers reading series <em>It&rsquo;s About Time</em>, held <a href="http://itsaboutimewriters.homestead.com">every second Thursday at the Seattle Public Library&rsquo;s Ballard Branch</a>. The list of past readers is a who&rsquo;s-who of Seattle poets and writers, and exactly the sort of Library we&rsquo;re advocating for: one that works with the community to make reading and writing more vibrant.</p>

<p>Of course, sponsors like Helfgott are what allow us to report on issues like the Library, and keep reviews and updates coming your way. It&rsquo;s part of our <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">campaign to make internet advertising 100 percent less terrible</a>.
