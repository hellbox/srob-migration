<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1522977274777/Lindy%20West_150.jpeg" alt="" /></p>Here&rsquo;s what Lindy West had to say on Facebook about her April 15 show at Benaroya Hall: <em>Huge news! I&rsquo;m speaking at Benaroya Hall! All by myself! For a long time! WITH A HUMOROUS SLIDESHOW!</em></p>

<p>Frankly, she had us at &ldquo;I&rsquo;m speaking&rdquo;; by the end of that string of phrases, we were ready to see her twice. These are trying times, and they deserve to be skewered, as only Lindy West can.
