Artist Trust just spread the word today:

<blockquote>
Artist Trust is excited to announce that writer Peter Mountford is receiving the 2016 Gar LaSalle Storyteller Award. The Gar LaSalle Storyteller Award is an unrestricted award of $10,000 given to a Washington State fiction writer whose work demonstrates excellence in storytelling. This is the second year the award has been given. Last year’s recipient was Anca Szilágyi.
</blockquote>

A name known all around Seattle's writing community, <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMountford" title="Peter Mountford (@PeterMountford) | Twitter">Peter Mountford</a> is the author of the novels _A Young Man's Guide to Late Capitalism_, which won the 2012 Washington State Book Award for fiction, and _The Dismal Science_, which in 2014 was a _New York Times_ Editor's Choice. He's been published widely, from the _Atlantic_, to _New York Times Magazine_, to the _Sun_. Plus, if you've seen a heroically amazing writer talk at Hugo House in the last few years, odds are that they appeared because Mountford asked them, in his capacity as events curator. 

But of course, this recognition comes because of his phenomenal writing, which was the word Paul Constant used to sum up _The Dismal Science_. Mountford is a fine writer, and there is no doubt he'll put the time that money will buy him to very good use. Congratulations to him; he now joins the fine company of <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/08/anca-szil%C3%A1gyi-wins-the-first-gar-lasalle-storyteller-award/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Anca Szilágyi wins the first Gar LaSalle Storyteller Award">Anca Szilágyi</a> as the two recipients of this still-new, exciting prize.
