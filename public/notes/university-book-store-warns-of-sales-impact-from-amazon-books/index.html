<p>University Book Store manager Pam Cady is quoted extensively in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/21/amazon-books-opens-seattle-independent-bookstores">a piece by Julia Carrie Wong  in the <em>Guardian</em></a> today. Cady says <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/09/the-algorithm-method/">Amazon&rsquo;s brick-and-mortar store</a> is having a serious effect on U Book Store&rsquo;s sales:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Everyone’s had to adjust to Amazon online,” she says, “but having a store just down the street is a little different. We’re at ground zero. We’re in the blast.” University Book Store is less than a mile away from Amazon Books.</p>

<p>Cady wouldn’t provide specific numbers on how Amazon Books has affected University Book Store’s sales, but she says that she’s definitely noticed “different spending patterns”.</p>

<p>“It scares me what could happen not just to us, but to everyone,” Cady said.</p></blockquote>

<p>A hopeful side of me believes that this rush to Amazon Books is a fad, a novelty. A slightly more cynical side of me believes that the customers you&rsquo;d find in Amazon Books are not the same customers you&rsquo;d find at one of Seattle&rsquo;s many independent bookstores.</p>

<p>But if you do visit Amazon Books to check out how an algorithmically obsessed bookstore works, the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> would like to gently remind you to <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/06/independent-bookstore-fan-showrooms-amazon-books/">reverse-showroom the hell out of the store</a>: browse at Amazon Books all you want, but please buy the books from an independent bookstore. Our local bookstores bring authors to town for free readings; they carry a stock many multiples larger than what is carried at Amazon Books; and they encourage a broader, more exciting browsing experience bolstered by tons of recommendations from the humans who work there. We believe this is something of value, something that should be supported.</p>
