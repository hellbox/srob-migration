<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to hear that the great Spokane alternative weekly the <em>Inlander</em> — which, full disclosure, <a href="http://www.inlander.com/spokane/ArticleArchives?author=2523577">publishes my writing</a> sometimes — is <a href="http://www.inlander.com/Bloglander/archives/2016/10/05/submit-your-creative-verses-for-the-inlanders-first-poetry-issue">planning a poetry issue</a>. And if you live in eastern Washington, they want you to send your poetry to them sometime before November 20th. They will publish roughly a dozen poems, with each poet receiving $40 for their work. Many thanks to the <em>Inlander</em> for supporting local poetry; I can&rsquo;t wait to read this issue.</p>
