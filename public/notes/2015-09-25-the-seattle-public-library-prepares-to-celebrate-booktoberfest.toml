**Dear all literate adults of drinking age in Seattle**: The Seattle Public Library is [hosting a happy hour at the Diller Room on Monday, October 19th](https://www.facebook.com/events/1501246780167954/). Why more libraries don't encourage drinking, frankly, is beyond me. This happy hour is part of a new program that's running next month. I'll let SPL explain:

<blockquote>Throughout October The Seattle Public Library brings you **Booktoberfest**, a celebration of books and beer at venues all over the city. Check out additional events, including Librarians’ Revenge Trivia Rounds, Bookish Happy Hours, ‘Ales from the Crypt: Spooky Stories ‘n Suds and more. Come join us, grab a pint, and get bookish!</blockquote>

I'd also encourage you to go and meet your librarians and tell them how much you love them and then buy them a beer because librarians are magic people who deserve all the beer you can throw in their general direction. (Related: Have you commented on [SPL's brand survey yet](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/21/help-seattle-public-library-remember-that-books-and-librarians-are-what-matter-most/)? Please do and then tell your friends to do the same; this is important.)
