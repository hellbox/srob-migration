<p>Nancy Pearl at Town Hall is our <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/07/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-december-7th-to-13th/">official Sunday pick</a>, but before you head there you should drop by Fantagraphics and say hey to Laura Knetzger, from 1-3pm. She&rsquo;s throwing a release party for <em>Bug Boys</em>.</p>

<p><em>Bug Boys</em> is a compendium of the comic of the same name, and it is <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/short-run-i-second-that/">really marvelous</a>. Head down for her official release party, pick up the book and give a local hard-working comic artist some love and sales.</p>
