<blockquote><p>Leon Wieseltier, a prominent editor at *The New Republic* for three decades who was preparing to debut a magazine this fall, apologized on Tuesday for “offenses against some of my colleagues in the past” after several women accused him of sexual harassment and inappropriate advances.</p>

<p>As those allegations came to light, Laurene Powell Jobs, a leading philanthropist whose for-profit organization, Emerson Collective, was backing Mr. Wieseltier’s endeavor, decided to pull the plug on it.</p></blockquote>

<p>We&rsquo;ll likely be hearing a lot more about men behaving badly in the literary world in the near future. It&rsquo;s important that we don&rsquo;t make apologies for these men, or allow them to remain in positions of power. It&rsquo;s important that we let the world know that we don&rsquo;t approve of this kind of behavior. It&rsquo;s got to stop. The first step toward a more safe, more inclusive future: women need to be in more positions of power in the literary world, starting right now.</p>
