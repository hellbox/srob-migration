Yesterday, Hugo House published the lineup of their 2016-2016 Word Works and Literary Series events. 

The [Literary Series](https://hugohouse.org/upcoming-events/hugo-literary-series/), which pairs writers and musicians to produce new work on a theme includes authors like Téa Obrecht, Alexander Chee, [Megan Kruse](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/tolstoys-unhappy-family-moves-to-the-northwest/), and Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore and musicians including beautiful Seattle-based electronic act [Crater](https://soundcloud.com/crater). [Word Works](https://hugohouse.org/upcoming-events/word-works/) is bringing authors like Patricia Smith (who kicked ass the last time she read at Hugo House,) Lidia Yuknavitch, and — perhaps most excitingly — Mary Gaitskill, who is one of the most underrated literary novelists in America today. 

[Non-series events presented by Hugo House this fall](https://hugohouse.org/upcoming-events/listing/) include a much-anticipated reading by Colson Whitehead, a new book from Michelle Tea, the launch of Seattle author Steven Barker's debut non-fiction collection *Now for the Disappointing Part*, Ed Skoog's latest poetry collection, and Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore's Contagious Exchanges series, featuring discussions between queer artists (such as Rebecca Brown and C. Davida Ingram) moderated by Sycamore. This is just a sampling of what was announced; [go check out the House's site](https://hugohouse.org/upcoming-events/listing/) for more details.
