<p class="intro">Tomorrow night is Lit Crawl, a bacchanalia of literary events spread over four courses across Capitol Hill, First Hill, and downtown. [You can find the full schedule here](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2017-schedule), but we wanted to provide a few possible itineraries for people who have a hard time making up their minds. Come back tomorrow for the next itnerary. [Here's yesterday's itinerary.](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/10/17/lit-crawl-itinerary-2-no-white-dudes/)</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1</strong>: Your night begins at the new Ollie Quinn eyewear shop on Capitol Hill with the best possible way to start a poetic journey through Lit Crawl: a reading from <em>Poetry Northwest</em>, the longest-running poetry publication in the region. Readers including Sarah Mar√≠a Medina, JM Miller, and Ellen Welcker will share their work and celebrate the continuation of the tradition of poetry in the Northwest.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 2</strong>: Weirdly, there&rsquo;s no poetry-only reading in the second phase of the evening. But that&rsquo;s okay. If you go to Barca, you&rsquo;ll find a celebration of graduates of the Hugo House&rsquo;s Made at Hugo program, which provides resources and networking for young Seattle writers. Former made at Hugo fellows Anca Szilagyi and Ross McMeekin, will be joined by two of Seattle&rsquo;s very best poets: Laura Da&rsquo; and Quenton Baker.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 3</strong>: At Still Liquor, Seattle-based poetry collective Margin Shift will present a lineup of poets including Adriana Nodal-Tarafa, Anne Tardos, Jennifer Firestone, and the fabulous Jamaica Baldwin</p>

<p><strong>Phase 4</strong>: Your poetry Lit Crawl will come to an end at Vermillion, where former Civic Poet Claudia Castro Luna will present a reading celebration of her Seattle Poetry Grid. Readers who have contributed to the online poetry map of the city including Lynn Miller, Brian Roth, and Shin Yu Pai will share their geographically oriented poems.</p>
