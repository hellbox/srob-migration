<blockquote>On Friday night, a "mysterious benefactor" purchased 50 copies of [*1984*] to be given away free at Booksmith in Haight-Ashbury. According to store owner Christin Evans, the generous citizen lives in the neighborhood ... Copies of the novel were snatched up within a couple of hours, but another benefactor soon stepped up to purchase copies of Margaret Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale" and Erik Larson's "In the Garden of Beasts" for the public. </blockquote>
