<p>Today would have been Octavia Butler&rsquo;s 70th birthday. Butler is considered one of the most influential and important Science Fiction writers of the late 20th century. She came up through the Clarion Workshop, where there is now a <a href="http://carlbrandon.org/butler-scholarship/">scholarship in her honor</a> to support writers of color. From there she went on to write <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/search/book?searchfor=Butler%2C+Octavia&amp;aff=hellbox">several novels</a>, publishing her last book in 2005. She was the first science fiction writer to be awarded a MacArthur Genius Award.</p>

<p>The Huntington Library is home to Butler&rsquo;s literary archive, the <a href="http://www.huntington.org/octaviabutler/">Octavia E. Butler Collection</a>, now on display in Pasadena, California.</p>
