<p>Many of the Girl Scout songs<br>
extorted a smile, our servile mugging &mdash;<br>
but this one we loved best.<br>
Starring a calf being hauled in a minor key,<br>
its refrain two mournful syllables: <em>dona</em>.<br>
First came the long <em>o</em> &mdash; in induction/seduction<br>
to join the animal&rsquo;s cargo cult, then came<br>
the short <em>a</em>, when the calf turned to beef<br>
with no last meal and no reprieve.<br>
The gist of the lyric: that we could choose<br>
to be the calf in the cart or the bird in the sky;<br>
the idea was simple, but also a lie: <em>dona</em>.<br>
Bird is small and can fly where it wants<br>
but it&rsquo;ll never be Miss Teen USA,<br>
whereas the word <em>abattoir</em> was a chic French Kiss<br>
our tongues would enter willingly.<br>
Let that bird flitter off<br>
like a dry dead leaf: this was a hymn<br>
that we sang on our knees<br>
on the dais by the flag, dressed in our sashes<br>
and green berets like irregulars planning<br>
a suicide mission: there was glory ahead<br>
when we signed on, clambered into the wagon,<br>
and let the future hitch up its horse.</p>
