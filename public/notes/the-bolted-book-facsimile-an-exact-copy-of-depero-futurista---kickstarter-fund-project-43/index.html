<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_The Bolted Book Facsimile: An Exact Copy of Depero Futurista_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1204158310/the-bolted-book-facsimile-an-exact-copy-of-depero). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Designers &amp; Books](http://www.designersandbooks.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
Help us publish the first exact copy of Fortunato Depero’s 1927 iconic work of avant-garde graphic design and book-making.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>
    

<p class="noindent">
One of the great things about the age we live in, and tools like Kickstarter, is the new market for specifically targeted campaigns for things that might not otherwise see the light of day. 
</p>

<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s a facsimile copy of Fortunato Depero&rsquo;s famous 1927 artist&rsquo;s book, a piece of high experimental design, typography, and playful artistry from one of the writers of the Futurist manifesto. This book is one of those sought-after artifacts that only wealthy collectors can afford — only 1000 were made, and who knows how many have survived to this day?</p>

<p>If you love art history, design history, and book history, then this project is the junction point where all three collide, but it&rsquo;s worth backing even if you only like one.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    This is Designer &amp; Books third Kickstarter. I personally backed their first, the reproduction of Ladislav Sutnar's _Visual Design in Action_, and earlier this year, [we recommended their publication](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/30/new-seymour-chwast-book-protests-5000-years-of-war-kickstarter-fund-project-17/) of Seymour Chwast's book on war paintings. 
</p>

<p>In short, they are experienced at delivering a high quality product, and so this exciting, and complicated, undertaking is in good hands.</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    At $249,000, this is the biggest ask they've made yet, but at over half-way there, and 33 days to go, looks like they have a shot. Get your copy now!

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
