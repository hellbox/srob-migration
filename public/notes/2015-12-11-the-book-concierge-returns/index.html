        <p>I&rsquo;ve said many times that I&rsquo;m not fond of year-end best-of book lists. Year-end lists, so far as I&rsquo;m concerned, are like junk food: they&rsquo;re enjoyable, but they&rsquo;re probably not worth the time you put into reading (or writing) them. If you&rsquo;re looking for what the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> believes to be the books of the year, I&rsquo;d encourage you to <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/page-5/">look back through our Reviews section</a>. Our co-founder Martin McClellan ingeniously constructed the Reviews pages to be something like browsing a bookstore. You can flip through the pages and browse the covers and see if something looks appealing to you.</p>

<p>But sometimes I have to acknowledge a particularly great year-in-review feature, and that is the case with <a href="http://apps.npr.org/best-books-2015/">NPR&rsquo;s Book Concierge</a>. I love it because it&rsquo;s not constructed around the artificial list structure that so many other reviews are. In fact, it&rsquo;s less a review and more <strong>a recommendation engine</strong>: choose from a selection of filter tabs on the side to help you find a book to suit any interest. Rather than focusing on what some critic believes to be the best book of the year, it&rsquo;s focused on what books you might find interesting. That distinction, to me, makes all the difference. If you haven&rsquo;t, <a href="http://apps.npr.org/best-books-2015/">go check it out</a>.</p>
