<p class="intro">On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our second suggested itinerary:</p>

<p>You could attend a whole evening&rsquo;s worth of poetry readings at Lit Crawl with a nice mix of new, up-and-coming, and established names, providing an excellent cross-section of where Northwest poetry is right now.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong>. Up at the Sorrento Hotel, Rebekah Anderson hosts a curiosity-themed evening of poetry with readers <a href="https://twitter.com/LLHitz?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Lucy Hitz</a>, <a href="https://jourdankeith.wordpress.com/about/">Jourdan Keith</a>, and <a href="http://dearmrpostman.com/i-already-love-you-come-party-with-me/">Maggie Hess</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>. Chances are good you&rsquo;ve already attended Cheap Wine &amp; Poetry. It&rsquo;s just probability in action: Hugo House is always packed full of people during CW&amp;P, and the series has been going on for years so it&rsquo;s likely you were in that crowd at some point. This special Lit Crawl edition of CW&amp;P features wine at a buck a glass and readings from <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/22/ten-thousand-saw-i-at-a-glance/">Arlene Kim</a>, <a href="http://www.mattgano.com/">Matt Gano</a>, and Seattle Civic Poet <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/03/claudia-castro-luna-is-seattles-new-civic-poet/">Claudia Castro Luna</a>, with host Jeanine Walker.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>. Storied poetry journal <em>Poetry Northwest</em> caps your poetry adventure at Sole Repair, with readings from <a href="http://www.clarejohnson.com/biography.php">Clare Johnson</a>, <a href="http://kathleenflenniken.com/blog/?p=1527">Suzanne Bottelli</a>, and <a href="http://kathleenflenniken.com/blog/?tag=emily-bedard">Emily Bedard</a>. <em>Poetry Northwest</em> editor Kevin Craft will host the evening.</p>
