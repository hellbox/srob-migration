        <p class="intro">Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles good for slow consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-sunday-post/" title="Sunday Post archives">look through the archives.</a></p>

<h5><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/taibbi-on-trump-the-destroyer-w473144" title="Trump the Destroyer - Rolling Stone">Trump the Destroyer</a></h5>

<p>Olivia Nuzzi published a <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/kellyanne-conway-trumps-first-lady.html" title="Kellyanne Conway Is a Star - New York Magazine">long and detailed profile of Kellyanne Conway</a> this week. It&#8217;s a can&#8217;t-look-away article, somewhere between trainwreck and victory march. (Side note: Like a lot of other people, I&#8217;m pretty sure I could manage to dislike Conway in person. Her particular brand of fact-bending makes my teeth itch.)</p>

<p>You should read the profile, which is crazy fascinating, but then follow up with <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/taibbi-on-trump-the-destroyer-w473144" title="Trump the Destroyer - Rolling Stone">this awesomely sardonic essay by Matt Taibbi</a> on how neatly we&#8217;ve been suckered into co-creating, with Trump, a &#8220;WWE future where government is a for-profit television program.&#8221; Ahem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump leans over and pauses to soak in the love, his trademark red tie hanging like the tongue of a sled dog. Finally he turns and flashes a triumphant thumbs-up. A chant breaks out:</p>

<p>"U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!"</p>

<p>Reporters stare at one another in shock. They were mute bystanders seconds ago; now they're the 1980 Soviet hockey team. One turns to a colleague and silently mouths: "U-S-A? What the f ... "</p></blockquote>

<p>A friendship forged in the kitchen — superstar chef Mario Batali on eating and cooking with superstar writer Jim Harrison. Would love to have been at a quiet corner table to observe these giants at dinner.</p>

<blockquote>
We once shared a slightly overlong supper at the Michelin three-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park, in New York, where he fidgeted through most of the complex meal, announcing early on in his loud baritone to the entire dining room, “Maaaario, you know I am much more of a trattoria kind of guy,” and finally sending his chicken back to the kitchen, because the chef had somehow denied him “THE FUCKING LEGS . . . where are THE FUCKING LEGS . . . ?”

<p>Game designer/developer Ed Fries went searching for the ultimate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/02/12-greatest-video-game-easter-eggs" title="The 12 greatest video game 'Easter eggs' - The Guardian">Easter egg</a>: an inside joke hidden so deeply in a vintage game that even its creator had forgotten how to trigger it. Fries scoured code, jury-built an emulator, and rebuilt a classic arcade machine to find it. (via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/the-arcade-worlds-first-easter-egg-discovered-after-fraught-journey/" title="The arcade world’s first Easter egg discovered after fraught journey - Ars Technica">Ars Technica</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p>I was kind of stunned. If this was true it would certainly predate the earliest video game Easter egg that I knew of and the one that is most often cited as being the first: “Adventure” for the Atari 2600 from 1979. I did a little searching online and found that there was an even earlier Easter egg in the game “Video Whizball” which was released in 1978 for the Fairchild Channel F game console.</p>

<p>But there was a problem. Ron didn’t remember exactly how to bring up the Easter egg. He remembered showing it off to some buddies at a county fair when the game first came out, but that was 40 years ago!</p></blockquote>

<p>Malware is sort of like an Easter egg — if you cracked open the pastel treat and found a rotting yolk that emptied your bank account electronically. Or, in this case, helped tilt an election and change the shape of a country.</p>

<p>Garrett Graff traces the hunt for Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, or &#8220;Slavik,&#8221; the malware artist who designed the &#8220;the Microsoft Office of online fraud.&#8221; Great story of a breathtaking cat-and-mouse battle between Slavik and the investigators that tracked the elusive hacker from petty online theft to potentially influencing the US presidential outcome.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Tillman] Werner, as it happened, knew quite a bit about Evgeniy Bogachev. He knew in precise, technical detail how Bogachev had managed to loot and terrorize the world’s financial systems with impunity for years. He knew what it was like to do battle with him.</p>

<p>But Werner had no idea what role Bogachev might have played in the US election hack. Bogachev wasn’t like the other targets—he was a bank robber. Maybe the most prolific bank robber in the world. </p></blockquote>
