        <p>Oh, hey — <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/business/media/barnes-noble-wants-to-become-more-than-books.html?_r=0">here&rsquo;s a terrible idea</a>:</p>

<blockquote>To that end, [Barnes & Noble Chief Executive Ron] Boire is leading a push to rebrand Barnes & Noble as more than just a bookstore by expanding its offerings of toys, games, gadgets and other gifts and reshaping the nation’s largest bookstore chain into a “lifestyle brand.”</blockquote>

<p>You might argue that Barnes &amp; Noble won&rsquo;t be able to survive by just selling books. I would refute your argument by pointing out that Barnes &amp; Noble stores are already stuffed to the rafters with cheap plastic crap. The last Barnes &amp; Noble I went to was painfully light on stock and crammed full of junk that nobody needs.</p>

<p>Here are some observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>People go to bookstores to browse. Online retailers suck at replicating the act of browsing.</p></li>

<li><p>If you&rsquo;re only going to carry bestsellers and the most popular books of the moment, you&rsquo;d better be an airport bookstore <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/09/the-algorithm-method/">or Amazon Books</a>. People browse because they expect to find something they didn&rsquo;t know that they wanted. If your bookstore looks like it doesn&rsquo;t have any books on the shelves, people won&rsquo;t browse there.</p></li>

<li><p>Nobody in the history of the world has said &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go to the lifestyle brand and buy some things.&rdquo; Nobody cares about your &ldquo;lifestyle brand&rdquo; except the people you&rsquo;re paying to create your lifestyle brand.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When Barnes &amp; Noble eventually goes out of business — which, after reading this story, may be sooner rather than later — a bunch of writers will vomit up some think-pieces about the death of the book as a reason for Barnes &amp; Noble&rsquo;s demise when, in fact, they should link to this rebranding story. Lack of focus is how businesses die; this is what killed Borders, and it&rsquo;s what will kill Barnes &amp; Noble, too.</p>
