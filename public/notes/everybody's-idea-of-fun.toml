Sponsor Floating Bridge Press is back to present 2015 Chapbook Award finalist Brian Cooney, and his book _My Idea of Fun_. As always, Floating Bridge's Chapbook Award brings out the best in local poetry, and in Cooney they found a poet who is direct, funny, and connected to pop culture in an expressive way.
