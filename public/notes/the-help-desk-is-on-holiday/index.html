<p>Even advice columnists need to take some time to recharge. Our Help Desk columnist, Cienna Madrid, will be taking this week and next week off. She&rsquo;ll return on the first Friday of 2017. You can <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-help-desk/">read the full archive of her columns right here</a> and, as always, if you need any literary advice, please do send an email to advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.</p>
