<p>We&rsquo;re big fans of Seattle poet <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/06/korean-war/">EJ Koh</a>, and we think you should be big fans of EJ Koh, too. If you need an introduction, you should read <a href="http://www.hoctok.com/ej-koh.html">this interview with Koh published in Hoctok</a>. I especially like that the interview is broken up with Koh&rsquo;s poetry; it&rsquo;s surprising that more literary interview outlets don&rsquo;t liberally intersperse their interviews with actual examples of the writers&rsquo; work. Seeing an author&rsquo;s thoughts and words in such close proximity to each other provides a more immersive experience for the reader.</p>
