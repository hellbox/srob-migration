<p>Now: we&rsquo;re taking the day off, but we don&rsquo;t want to leave you in the lurch for summer reading, so we thought we&rsquo;d share <a href="http://www.qabookco.com/mcclure-summer-reading">Queen Anne Book Company&rsquo;s page for the McClure Middle School&rsquo;s summer reading program</a>. We wish <a href="http://www.qabookco.com/6th-grade-mcclure-summer-reading">this was our required reading in 6th grade</a>. Nothing against <em>Johnny Tremain</em>, but the kids at McClure have an amazing mix of comics, sci-fi, and socially engaged literature to choose from. A reading list like this gives us hope for our country&rsquo;s future.</p>
