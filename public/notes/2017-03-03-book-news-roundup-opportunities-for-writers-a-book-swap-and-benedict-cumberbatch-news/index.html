        <p><strong>Today&rsquo;s Book News Roundup begins with three neat local opportunities</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are you a poet? Do you want to be Seattle&rsquo;s next Civic Poet? The position, as pioneered by our first Civic Poet <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-poet-says-what-the-politician-cannot/">Claudia Castro Luna</a>, is about advocacy — about reading poetry at City Hall meetings and teaching classes about interpreting the city through poetry. She&rsquo;s done a stellar job and the next Civic Poet has a lot to live up to. It&rsquo;s a two-year program, and the winner receives $10,000 budgeted over that time. Deadlines are due on April 24th. <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/arts/seattle-is-seeking-the-next-civic-poet-x70875">Find everything you need to know right here</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Are you a cartoonist who&rsquo;s just starting out? You should apply for <a href="http://shortrun.org/category/dash-grant/">Short Run&rsquo;s Dash Grant</a>, which provides the winner with &ldquo;$250 to complete and premiere their comic at the festival [which this year happens on November 4th in Seattle Center], mentorship by a special guest, access and instruction to local screenprint shop Fogland Studios, a free half table at the festival, and a spot in our annual gallery show. This is a terrific grant that provides up-and-coming cartoonists with a chance to make a big splash in a major Seattle comics and independent literature festival. Deadline for this is April 22.</p></li>

<li><p>Do you know a writer, cartoonist, or other literary artist who deserves special recognition? <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Courage2017">Nominate them for the Courage in Culture Award</a>, which is part of Crosscut&rsquo;s annual Courage Awards. The deadline for nominations is March 13th.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>And in other news</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Congratulations to the Seattle Public Library&rsquo;s ace Readers&rsquo; Service Librarian David Wright, who <a href="http://rusa.ala.org/update/2017/03/david-wright-wins-novelists-margaret-e-monroe-award-for-library-adult-services/">just won</a> the Margaret E. Monroe Library Adult Services Award winner for &ldquo;outstanding contributions to readers’ advisory and adult services.&rdquo; Wright is one of the best librarians in town.</p></li>

<li><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something to do tomorrow, the Phinney Neighborhood Association is <a href="https://www.phinneycenter.org/events/bookxchange.html">hosting a book exchange</a>. Bring in your beloved cookbooks, sci fi/fantasy, mystery, and kids&rsquo; books and swap them out for some new-to-you finds! If you have no books to swap, they&rsquo;re also selling books at $1 per paperback and $2 per hardcover. It&rsquo;s happening from 11 am to 2 pm at the Neighborhood Center, and it&rsquo;s free to enter.</p></li>

<li><p>Barnes &amp; Noble&rsquo;s third quarter sales <a href="http://investors.barnesandnobleinc.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1015498">declined 8 percent</a> year-over-year. It&rsquo;s been a long, long time since we&rsquo;ve seen unabashedly good news coming from Barnes &amp; Noble.</p></li>

<li><p>Patrick Melrose&rsquo;s exquisite Edward St. Aubyn novels are <a href="https://electricliterature.com/benedict-cumberbatch-will-star-in-tv-adaptation-of-edward-st-aubyn-books-f55f00c2dfe0#.858hvym62">being adapted into a TV miniseries</a>, and Benedict Cumberbatch is set to star. When I read the St. Aubyn books a few years ago, I actually pictured Cumberbatch as the protagonist. I don&rsquo;t know if that means Cumberbatch is a good choice or a bad choice. No air date has been announced, which means it&rsquo;s unclear when we&rsquo;ll discover if the TV show can sustain the book&rsquo;s bitter sense of humor and louche-but-opulent weariness for five full episodes.</p></li>
