        <p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/29/gay-romance-novelist-accused-of-plagiarizing-straight-romance-novelist/?postshare=2941446146929937">Gay-romance novelist accused of plagiarizing straight-romance novelist</a>.&rdquo; I mention this story in part because plagiarism is always fascinating â€” in part because it&rsquo;s always unnecessary. Why steal someone else&rsquo;s words when there are all these free words floating around our heads all day?</p>

<p>But this story is especially interesting: who was the person who reads both straight and gay romance who uncovered this plagiarism in the first place? I know they exist, and I think that&rsquo;s great, but what is the reading process like? Were they drawn to these books specifically because they sounded similar? What was it like, telling the alleged victim of plagiarism about your discovery? Will these questions ever be answered? I want this story to be a TV movie of the week so, so badly.</p>
