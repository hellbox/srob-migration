        <p>Today, local literary magazine <em>The James Franco Review</em>, which treats every submission as though it was written by James Franco, <a href="http://thejamesfrancoreview.com/2015/09/02/an-emergency-issue-art-and-engagement/">started rolling out an &ldquo;Emergency Issue&rdquo;</a> on art and engagment. What does that mean?</p>

<blockquote>Writers, editors, and artists around the country explored what it meant for them to be politically or consciously engaged in their work and to also examine literature’s relationship to safety.</blockquote>

<p>The first piece, by Nancy Jooyoun Kim, is <a href="http://thejamesfrancoreview.com/2015/09/15/safe-and-sound-by-nancy-jooyoun-kim/">live now</a>, and it&rsquo;s powerful stuff, about her own experience with a white writer who workshopped a story with a black protagonist.</p>

<blockquote> Someone “hinted” at the “potential” problem of the protagonist’s race.

That was enough for the writer to decide to make the character white. It’d be easier.

A wave of relief washed over the room.</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m so excited for this &ldquo;Emergency Issue.&rdquo; And I love the idea of an Emergency Issue, too. It makes the act of publication so urgent and relevant. Go <a href="http://thejamesfrancoreview.com/2015/09/15/safe-and-sound-by-nancy-jooyoun-kim/">give the <em>JF Review</em> your attention</a>.</p>

<p>And while we&rsquo;re talking about awesome local literary magazines, the <em>Moss</em> Kickstarter has already met its goal with 21 days left to go. If you&rsquo;re interested in owning an attractive print anthology of Northwest writing, you can <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ajdl/moss-volume-one-a-print-anthology-of-northwest-wri?ref=category">go buy a copy for $10 and up</a>. <em>Moss</em> <a href="http://www.mosslit.com/vol01/issue03_kickstart.html">generously makes their magazine available for free online</a>, and this is a way to invest in the magazine&rsquo;s future.</p>
