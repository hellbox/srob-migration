<p>Our sincerest thanks to Janine A. Southard for sponsoring <em>The Seattle Review of Books</em> this week. Sponsorships are very important to us. Why? <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">Because internet advertising is horrible and we&rsquo;re trying to do something about it</a>.</p>

<p>So, instead, we offer a full chapter from Southard&rsquo;s hilarious, and well-loved <em>Cracked! A Magic iPhone Story</em> (four stars on Amazon!) book. The award-winning Southard (a Seattle denizen) shows you how the geeks of Seattle live, provides a running and often-hilarious social commentary on todayâ€™s world, and reminds you that, so long as you have friends, you are never alone.</p>

<p>Help support The <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> by <a href="/sponsorships/">reading her excerpt</a> and ordering the novel if you like what you read.</p>

<p>Thanks to Janine for her support, and thank you for taking a look.</p>
