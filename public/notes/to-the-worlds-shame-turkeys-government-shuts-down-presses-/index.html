<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/03/free-speech-groups-condemn-turkeys-closure-of-29-publishers-after-failed-coup">this <em>Guardian</em> story by Alison Flood</a> about the situation in Turkey, please do so:</p>

<blockquote>President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government used a state of emergency law to close the 29 publishing houses last week, along with a swath of newspapers, television channels, magazines and news agencies. According to the Turkish Publishers Association, the decree means that all goods, assets, rights, documents and papers belonging to the publishers will be transferred free of charge to the Turkish treasury, with no appeal to be made, and the prospect of further publishers being shut down in the future.</blockquote>

<p>It is the 21st century and governments are still shutting down publishers. This is an embarrassment for the international community, and a chilling reminder that Donald Trump&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/interrogation/2016/03/donald_trump_vs_the_media_how_he_could_curtail_freedom_of_the_press_as_president.html">calls to curtail freedom of the press</a> are not fanciful. Weak leaders will always attack the written word.</p>
