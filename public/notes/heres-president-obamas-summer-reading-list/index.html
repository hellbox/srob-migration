<p>David Nakamura at the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/13/here-are-the-6-books-on-president-obamas-summer-reading-list/"><em>Washington Post</em></a> reports the six books President Obama is taking on his 16-day summer vacation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Washington: A Life</em> by Ron Chernow</p></li>

<li><p><em>Between the World and Me</em> by Ta-Nehisi Coates</p></li>

<li><p><em>All The Light We Cannot See</em> by Anthony Doerr</p></li>

<li><p><em>The Sixth Extinction</em> by Elizabeth Kolbert</p></li>

<li><p><em>The Lowland</em> by Jhumpa Lahiri</p></li>

<li><p><em>All That Is</em> by James Salter</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty impressive summer reading list. The Lahiri novel is an underrated work, the Doerr is unanimously beloved, and the Coates is beautiful and challenging and heartbreaking.</p>
