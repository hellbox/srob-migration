<p>If you have gone, or can&rsquo;t go, to <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/19/your-week-in-readings-the-best-events-from-october-19th-to-26th/">our recommended reading in Bellevue today</a>, come tonight and see Johanna Sinisalo at Elliott Bay Bookstore! She&rsquo;ll be introduced by Lola Rogers, who just wrote about <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/that-is-so-weird/">Sinisalo for us earlier this week</a>.</p>

<p>Sinisalo is truly remarkable &mdash; a writer of the strange and wonderful. Modern spec fic fans will love her work, and her travelling to Seattle from her home in Finland is a rare occasion worth celebrating. Hope to see you tonight!</p>
