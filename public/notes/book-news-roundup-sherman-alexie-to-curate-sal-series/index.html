He talked with <em>Daily Show</em> host Trevor Noah about the problems of being a Junior, Crazy Horse&rsquo;s childhood name, Andrew Jackson, and the name of Washington DC&rsquo;s football team.</li>

<li><p>Over at the <a href="https://thejamesfrancoreview.com/2016/05/09/editorial-note-in-response-to-the-sacred-androgen/"><em>James Franco Review</em></a>, editor Corinne Manning wrote an insightful response to the <em>Antioch Review</em>&rsquo;s <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/05/05/antioch-review-publishes-transphobic-essay/">horrendous transphobic essay</a>, accusing the editors of the <em>Antioch</em> of laziness and a lack of discernment.

<li><p>As part of her ongoing series of delightful exit interviews, Bookslut founder <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/09/jessa-crispin-bookslut-publishing-new-york-literature">Jessa Crispin told <em>The Guardian</em></a> that literature had become dull lately because “We all have to be in job-interview mode all of the time.

Say what you will about Barnes &amp; Noble, but Riggio has kept it afloat for decades, sometimes seemingly through sheer force of will. The future of the chain is definitely in question now that he&rsquo;s moving on.</li>
