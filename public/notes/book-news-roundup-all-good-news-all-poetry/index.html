<li><p>It has been, to say the least, a crazy week. Locally, everybody is running for mayor. Nationally, our president&rsquo;s brain seems to be degrading at an alarming rate. So let&rsquo;s end the week with a piece of unabashed good news and a pair of excellent poems by Seattle poets, okay? Be good to yourself — and the moms in your life — this weekend. Spend a few hours at a bookstore. Read a book. Don&rsquo;t go on the internet on Mother&rsquo;s Day.</p></li>

<li><p>Seattle poet Jane Wong recorded part of her poem &ldquo;Pastoral Power&rdquo; with KUOW. It&rsquo;s lovely and <a href="http://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=528028469:528028485">you can listen to it here</a>.</p></li>
