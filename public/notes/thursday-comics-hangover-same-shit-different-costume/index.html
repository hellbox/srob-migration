<p>Most modern superhero comics feel like action figure catalogs. Every story involves a new costume, or an alternate-reality version of a character, or a new character taking over the title temporarily. It just feels like the creators are stewards of an IP, adding value to the original concept by spinning a variant into existence that will one day be molded into plastic and sold.</p>

<p>The first issue of artist Greg Capullo and writer Scott Snyder&rsquo;s DC crossover comic <em>Dark Nights: Metal</em> is basically everything modern audiences want in superhero comics: wall-to-wall action, decorated with a bunch of Easter eggs that call back to decades of convoluted continuity. It opens with the Justice League in outer space, being forced into gladiatoral combat, and it expands into a secret society revealing the imminent invasion of a grave threat that might destroy the universe or whatever.</p>

<p>Snyder and Capullo create at least two sets of likely profitable action figures in the first ten pages of this book: Gladiator Justice League and Voltron Justice League. Later, we see silhouettes indicating yet another variant: Evil Alternate Universe Batman Justice League. Plus, Batman rides a dinosaur and he almost says the word &ldquo;ass,&rdquo; both of which are sure to wind up in some listicle on some zombie comics news site as one of the Top 15 Most Awesome Moments In Comics This Year. (You can practically read the breathless copy now: &ldquo;Four words: Batman. Riding. A. Dinosaur. &lsquo;Nuff said.&ldquo;)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an obvious high level of competency in the actual craft of the comic. Snyder is very good at getting information across in a very small space, and Capullo is better than most superhero comics artists at designing a page. They seem to work well together, and the book is technically very proficient.</p>

<p>But the last page involves a character who simply shouldn&rsquo;t be there. I won&rsquo;t spoil the big surprise, but let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s akin to the revelation that DC Comics is incorporating Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&rsquo;s Watchmen comics into mainstream DC continuity. It feels like another pointless violation of another barrier, and it cheapens a much-loved comics property by turning it into a plot point. But hey â€” at least it&rsquo;ll make a really cool action figure line one day.</p>
