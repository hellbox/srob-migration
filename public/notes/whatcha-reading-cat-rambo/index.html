<p class="noindent">**What are you reading now?**</p>

<p class="noindent">Right now I am reading [Louisa Morgan's](https://www.facebook.com/CatholicWitch/) [_A Secret History of Witches_](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316508551). Morgan's the pen name for local author Louise Marley, whose work I enjoy under any name.

<p class="noindent">**What did you read last?**</p>

<p class="noindent">I just finished up [John Hornor Jacob's](http://www.johnhornorjacobs.com/) [_Incorruptibles_](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780575123465) trilogy, a wild mash-up of weird Western steampunky stuff with an alternate history where Roman never fell. Highly recommended!</p>

<p class="noindent">**What are you reading next?**</p>

<p class="noindent">Next up is [M. Suddain's](https://twitter.com/suddain) [_Theatre of the Gods_](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780099575641), which the [Guardian described](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/18/science-fiction-roundup-reviews) as "like Douglas Adams channeling William Burroughs channeling Ionesco, spiced with the comic brio of Vonnegut." How could I resist something like that?</p>
