<p>Caleb Crain&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/jonathan-franzen-strikes-again/399329/">piece for the <em>Atlantic</em> on <em>Purity</em></a> bears a salacious headline — &ldquo;Jonathan Franzen Strikes Again:
His latest targets: web sleuths and feminists&rdquo; — but it&rsquo;s really just one of those pre-publication book reviews that kind of gives out way too much information about the book. You can expect all kinds of clickbait-y headlines in the next few weeks, now that Franzen&rsquo;s back in town.</p>

<p>Honestly, I haven&rsquo;t decided whether I&rsquo;m going to read <em>Purity</em> or not; there are so many great books by non-Franzens out there just waiting to be read, and I was <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/past-master/Content?oid=4939383">underwhelmed both by <em>Freedom</em></a> and by Franzen&rsquo;s last Seattle appearance.</p>

<p>And for the record, the best thing ever written about Franzen is this microfiction by Patricia Lockwood, which she read the last time she appeared in Seattle:</p>
