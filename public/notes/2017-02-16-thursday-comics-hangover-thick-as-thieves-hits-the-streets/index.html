        <p>I couldn&rsquo;t make it out to the <em>Thick as Thieves</em> launch party last Sunday night at Brainfreeze in the old Lusty Lady building, but copies of the first official issue of <em>Thick as Thieves</em> have started to make their way through the city. You should pick one up.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/11/03/can-the-intruder-community-remain-as-thick-as-thieves/">told you about the proof-of-concept issue of <em>Thick as Thieves</em> back in November</a>. Basically, it&rsquo;s a free comic newspaper in the vein of <em>Intruder</em>, featuring Seattle-area cartoonists doing whatever they want for one full page per cartoonist. The issue just hitting stands this week is end-to-end entertaining.</p>

<p>The MVP of <em>Thick as Thieves</em> issue one is Seattle cartoonist Marie Hausauer, who recently published <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/12/08/thursday-comics-hangover-the-dead-mammal/">a terrific comic book about a dead raccoon</a>. Hausauer contributes the cover for the issue, a beautifully rendered piece that resembles the work of Jason Lutes, and she illustrates the best, funniest strip in the issue, about a woman whose boyfriend undergoes a horrific transformation. (I don&rsquo;t want to tell you any more than that because the joke is too good.)</p>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1487226148326/NoelKat.jpg)</p>

<p>Other standout comics in the issue include an ode to skirts by Whitney Stephens, a great and gory comic strip offering a cathartic Donald Trump moment by Katie Wheeler, a great gag about a seemingly indefatigable customer service rep by Ben Horak, and a fantastic action strip by Marc Palm that has to be a contender for the (nonexistent) 2017 Award for Best Final Panel in a One-Page Strip.</p>

<p>A couple of pages in <em>Thick as Thieves</em> are uneven, but that&rsquo;s to be expected in an anthology. But the good far outranks the bad, and the increase in quality between the first test-run issue and this first official issue indicates that <em>Thick as Thieves</em> could eventually outstrip <em>Intruder</em> if editors Simon Lazarus Vasta and Ryan Tiszai continue on this learning curve.</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p>Warren Ellis&rsquo;s later comics work hasn&rsquo;t done it for me. Even the stuff that most people dig, like <em>Trees</em> and <em>Injection</em>, have just felt like late-stage Ellis to me, which is to say it feels kind of like self-parody: people behave like bastards; they say outrageous things in a condescending tone; some giant threat vaguely makes itself known; finally, everything collapses into a highly unsatisfying ending. Nothing of Ellis&rsquo;s since <em>Planetary</em> has really worked.</p>

<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m not sure why I gave the first issue of <em>The Wild Storm</em> the time of day. It&rsquo;s a reboot of Jim Lee&rsquo;s awful Wildstorm superhero universe, which has never really interested me. But the only good Wildstorm comics were Ellis&rsquo;s — particularly his <em>Authority</em> and <em>Planetary</em>, which are the source code for pretty much every superhero comic published in the last decade and a half. The thought of Ellis returning to these comics to restart them with a clean slate seemed like a mammoth mistake. I guess I wanted to gawk at a car crash.</p>

<p>The car crash didn&rsquo;t happen. <em>The Wild Storm</em> is easily Ellis&rsquo;s best mainstream work in a while. It&rsquo;s dialogue-heavy, and a few of the characters aren&rsquo;t immediately unlikeable, which is a refreshing change of pace. You won&rsquo;t find any of Jim Lee&rsquo;s ludicrous costume designs here, and the characters are barely recognizeable; only their awkward insistence on being called by their superhero names — Zealot, Voodoo, etc. — ties them back to the old Image Comics days.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if <em>The Wild Storm</em> will hold up. It&rsquo;s scheduled to run for 24 issues over two years, and Ellis has proven that he&rsquo;s pretty bad at marathons, to say nothing of his inability to end a damn project in a satisfying way. But it&rsquo;s a promising start, at least.</p>
