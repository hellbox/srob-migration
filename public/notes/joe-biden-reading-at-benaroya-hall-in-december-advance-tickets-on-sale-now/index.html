<p>Joe Biden is coming to Benaroya Hall on December 3rd to read from his upcoming book <em>Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose</em>. Elliott Bay Book Company is selling advance tickets. You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/elliottbaybookcompany/posts/10155592131924637">get all the information you need from their Facebook page</a>. (But be warned that you <em>will</em> experience sticker-shock; tickets are in the three figures, for the most part. It costs a lot to bring these bigwigs to town in a venue large enough to support them. I assure you no greedy booksellers are getting rich off your ticket sales.)</p>
