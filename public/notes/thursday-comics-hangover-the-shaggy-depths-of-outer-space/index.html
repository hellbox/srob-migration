When I was a kid, I loved poring over the old cosmic superhero comics of the 1970s. Something about those books — their shaggy-haired heroes pondering the self and free will, against a trippy backdrop of stars and cosmic energy — appealed to my sense of self-indulgence.</p>

<p>One of my favorites from that time was Jim Starlin&rsquo;s <em>Adam Warlock</em> series, a blessedly self-contained adventure of a space messiah who ultimately had to confront his twisted mature self. (In the 1970s, the Warlock story had a beginning, middle, and end, which was a rarity in serialized superhero comics. In the 1990s, Starlin revived Warlock and put him back on the intellectual property merry-go-round. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the character stayed dead.) The book was visually wild, conceptually bold, and as cerebral as it was fun.</p>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t know when I first read those cosmic superhero stories was that in 1970s France, an artist named Phillippe Druillet was creating a line of wild cosmic adventures that made its American counterparts seem as pedestrian as a <em>Garfield</em> comic strip.</p>

Now, Titan Comics is reprinting Druillet&rsquo;s <em>Lone Sloane</em> comics in a gorgeous series of slim oversized albums. The latest, <em>Gail</em>, is out later this month, and it&rsquo;s astounding. <em>Gail</em> is the story of an evil alien race, &ldquo;made of metal and hate,&rdquo; whose &ldquo;only pleasure was to kill, their only ambition to kill more.&ldquo;The beginning of <em>Gail</em> depicts their empire in enormous double-page spreads showing vessels more gigantic and malevolent in scope than that Star Destroyer scene in the first <em>Star Wars</em> film.</p>

<p><em>Gail</em> is a sexy, vivid fever dream, a story of pure evil trying to exert its will on the universe. The panels are angular and detailed down to the very last millimeter: a dimension of fractal skeletons; an emperor languishing on a throne in the aftermath of an orgy; a foreboding castle that stretches miles into the stratosphere, with a real photograph of a woman&rsquo;s face embedded into the front of it.</p>

<p>Our hero, Sloane, is not as grandiloquent as some of Marvel&rsquo;s more pompous cosmic heroes (&ldquo;Go fuck yourselves!&rdquo; he roars at the bad guys at one point.) But he&rsquo;s every bit as tenacious, venturing to the land of the dead to confront his opponents and upend the evil empire using just his wits and existential angst as weapons.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what&rsquo;s happening at every point in the story, but that&rsquo;s not a strike against <em>Gail</em>. These cosmic books don&rsquo;t always follow the simple rules of cause and effect. Instead, they&rsquo;re examinations of what it means to be alive, to make moral choices in the universe, to carry the resonsiblity of existing. And <em>Gail</em> commits to the airy spirituality in a way that its American cousins could never manage. You&rsquo;ll never look at Adam Warlock the same way again after you read the adventures of his bonkers French cousin.</p>
