<p class="intro">On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our final suggested itinerary:</p>

<p>Today we&rsquo;re focusing on some Lit Crawl events featuring excellent local writers you really ought to know by now.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong>. Start your night out at Vermillion Art Gallery &amp; Bar, where local chapbook publisher Shotgun Wedding hosts a reading from Stephen Danos, Sarah Gallien, Graham Isaac, and Anca Szilagyi, who is one of our favorite up-and-coming authors.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> The Mineral School hosts an event at Still Liquor featuring Stephanie Kuehnert, Susan Meyers, and Kirsten Lunstrum. This one also features Jane Wong, who is a local poet that everyone is falling in love with. Wong&rsquo;s got a collection coming out early next year, and you&rsquo;ll want to see her before then so you can say you saw her way back when.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>. Back to Vermillion for the last reading of the night featuring the very funny John Osebold, the very intelligent John Olson, and the very intense Ellie Belew. Also reading tonight is Stacey Levine, who I think is maybe the best short story writer in Seattle, and a wonderful reader of her own work. If you&rsquo;ve lived in Seattle for more than six months, you&rsquo;ve probably seen Levine read. If you haven&rsquo;t, you need to fix that immediately. She&rsquo;s indescribably good, a rock star reader unlike any other.</p>
