<p>Port Townsend&rsquo;s Copper Canyon Press, which Sherman Alexie once declared at a reading was the best poetry publisher in America, <a href="http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/copper-canyon-press-to-publish-the-english-edition-of-a-new-pablo-neruda-collection/108209">broke a little book news yesterday at GalleyCat</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Copper Canyon Press will publish the English edition of a **new poetry collection by Nobel Prize-winning writer Pablo Neruda**. The Pablo Neruda Foundation announced the discovery of these 20 previously unknown pieces earlier this year.</blockquote>

<p>The book will be titled <em>Then Come Back: The Lost Neruda</em>.</p>

<p>Related: if you&rsquo;re looking to spice up your love life, the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> heartily recommends that you and your partner read Neruda poems to each other, preferably in a breathy whisper. Works every time.</p>
