          Fantagraphics Books is publishing a new comics anthology, titled Now. And Fantagraphics associate publisher Eric Reynolds explained to the Comics Reporter&rsquo;s Tom Spurgeon that the idea for Now came straight out of Seattle:  The idea really coalesced after last year's Short Run festival. I went to that show with a plan to really canvas the show and see what was there. I don't get to actually shop extensively at shows very often, and I ended up dropping close to a couple of hundred bucks, buying anything that looked even remotely interesting.

        <div class="content">
          The future of comic books is not superheroes; it’s young adult fiction. If you look back on the last fifteen years or so of popular comics bestsellers, it’s pretty easy to track the direction of reader and creator interest, from Mark Millar to Bryan Lee O’Malley to Faith Erin Hicks. It’s not as big a shift as, say, the death of the western novel, but it’s definitely there: whereas comics used to be serialized monthly to large and eager audiences, we’re seeing more and more trilogies starring young characters (mostly girls) released in large chunks once a year or so.

Wednesday May 31st: One Day We’ll All Be Dead and None of This Will Matter Reading
Scaachi Koul writes about culture for BuzzFeed. Her new, much-chatted-about collection of comic essays is about growing up in an Indian-Canadian family. Tonight, she’ll be in conversation with Seattle’s own Lindy West, who, as you may have heard, knows a thing or two about comedic essays. Seattle Public Library, 1000 4th Ave., 386-4636, http://spl.

Love him or hate him, Ronald Reagan was always a storyteller. As an actor, he wasn&rsquo;t especially gifted, but he devoted himself to the schmaltzy stories as best he could. Reagan really found his storytelling gift when he became a politician — when he headed the Screen Actor&rsquo;s Guild and then went on a speaking tour to promote political values. And then, in 1980, he took on the role of a lifetime.

          Seattle nonprofit Shout Your Abortion really hit a nerve with its name. Founder Amelia Bonow took a lot of flack from self-described progressives when she started the organization: they supported the organization&rsquo;s calling, they would say, but then they would hem and haw for a second before getting to the point: isn’t it in bad taste, they’d stammer, to “shout” abortions?
They have it entirely wrong, of course. They think the name Shout Your Abortion is aimed at right-wing religious conservatives, when in fact the name has more to do with them.

Sponsor Anne Mendel delivered us a full chapter from her comically twisted dark novel _Etiquette for an Apocalypse_. Set in Portland in 2020, Mendel gives us a future when humanity is falling apart, people are fending for themselves, but the protagonist's mother still insists on dressing for dinner. What standards should we hold as society collapses around us?
Read the first full chapter on our sponsor&rsquo;s page &mdash; we think you&rsquo;ll really enjoy it.

          This past Saturday, I walked around Lake Washington. It was 52 miles — the longest I’ve ever walked, or, likely, will ever walk, in a single day — and it took from 4 in the morning until 9:30 at night.
If you ever wanted to understand the great economic disparities in King County, I’d urge you to circle Lake Washington. The Loop Trail, which at times doesn’t hew very closely to the contours of the lake, will take you near some of the poorest neighborhoods in the region and through some of the wealthiest.

          The workers hum to wile away
the afternoon and tenants chide
their sons to sweep from room to room
last night&rsquo;s dust motes &mdash; stirred dreams
entangled in wide streaks of light
that, in the daytime, bloom,
unsparing, bright &mdash; like operatic
high notes. Pierced and round,
the clouds of sleep fill us with
sound. A loss. A tune so deep within
the brain we cannot help but weep
as sons push brushes past door after door

          Our May poet-in-residence, [Oliver de la Paz](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/oliver-de-la-paz/), is the first *Seattle Review of Books*-published poet who does not currently live in the Pacific Northwest. We wanted to spotlight him because for well over a decade, he was one of the best-respected writers in town — one of those rare selfless authors who would show up as a sign of support at book launch parties even when he wasn’t scheduled to read.

The Beleaguered Tenants of ‘Kushnerville’ Withholding maintenance as a power play, hardcore debt collection, and public shaming for late rent — sounds like a classic slumlord. Or, maybe, Jared Kushner.
