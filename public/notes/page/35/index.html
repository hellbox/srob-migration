        <div class="content">
          Australian comic and TV writer Tom Taylor announced last night on Facebook that he&rsquo;s not going to attend Emerald City Comicon this week in Seattle. In fact, he&rsquo;s not coming to the United States at all this year. Why? Well, I&rsquo;ll let him speak for himself:
...America, through no fault of most of its citizens, doesn’t feel like a safe or welcoming travel destination at this moment.
There have been reports of interrogation, phone data downloads, requests for social media accounts, returns and five-year travel bans and everyone from children to the elderly being detained.

Sponsor Sagging Meniscus is back to show a remarkable work by Stephen Moles, called _The Most Wretched Thing Imaginable_. We've got a nice sample of his sparkling prose on our sponsor's page, but there's also two videos of Moles reading from the work, as an added treat.
Read about how Moles got started in this work by translating the song of birds into messages, and how it all relates to his Dark Meaning Research Institute.

Laurie Penny has spent solid time with Milo Yiannopoulis and his young male entourage, and her account from the tour bus during the Berkeley riot is mesmerizing and exceptionally well written.

        <div class="content">
          A piece for the Millions titled &ldquo;Against Readability&rdquo; by Harvard College Writing Program professor Ben Roth has been circling the lit-o-sphere this week. It&rsquo;s a classic finger-wagging routine about serious literature from an establishment male:
“Readable” has become the chosen term of praise in our times precisely because so many of us find ourselves unable to concentrate as we once could or still aspire to. But to praise readability is to embrace the vicious feedback loop that our culture now finds itself in.

          By now, you&rsquo;ve undoubtedly gotten into the practice of contacting your local representatives about issues that concern you. That&rsquo;s great! Now, our friends at Hugo House are asking that you momentarily set aside your Trump-related concerns so you can advocate for them.
As you know, developers are right now constructing a fancy new building where Hugo House once stood, and Hugo House will have a home in that building. And the House is in the running for a state grant to pay for their new home.
