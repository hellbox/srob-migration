Dear Cienna,
If one more douchey techbro tells me that TV shows are the new novels, I’m going to lose my mind. It’s become the stock response when I tell my coworkers that I enjoy reading.

          Every month, Nisi Shawl presents us with news and updates from her perch overlooking the world of science-fiction, fantasy, and horror. Read past columns here
Not what it used to be The future science fiction depicts has never been the future. So-called Golden Age SFFH of the late 1930s to mid-1940s projected its times’ values and aesthetics onto imaginary eras flung far over the event horizon. Robert A. Heinlein’s literal space cadets, like his juvenile hero Matt Dodson, are all heterosexual men, though daringly cosmopolitan in their inclusion of differing nationalities &mdash; one of them even speaks French!

What We Do Now: Standing Up for Your Values in Trump&rsquo;s America was announced right after Election Day last year. It was published right before Inauguration Day this year. A two-month window is incredibly small for the wholesale creation of a book — particularly one like What We Do Now, which anthologizes recent writing by big-name authors like Dave Eggers, George Saunders, Gloria Steinem, Robert Reich, and Elizabeth Warren. Ordinarily a work like this would span at least a year from inception to publication date.

        <div class="content">
          Regular readers of this column know that on the first Wednesday of every month, the Seattle Review of Books and the Seattle Weekly host a book club called Reading Through It at Third Place Books Seward Park. The response has been incredibly strong — anywhere between 60 and 100 attendees every month — because books are the perfect response to the historical moment.
It just makes sense that in a time when too many voters are low-information or low-empathy, we should turn to books for help.

          Faith Erin Hicks debuts her new comic The Stone Heart at Elliott Bay Book Company in conversation with G. Willow Wilson. They&#39;re getting deeply, delightfully nerdy right now.
A post shared by The Seatttle Review of Books (@seattlereviewof) on Apr 4, 2017 at 7:43pm PDT
 
I&rsquo;ve attended a lot of author events that have been billed as the author appearing &ldquo;in conversation with&rdquo; an interviewer. But those events are never actually conversations; they&rsquo;re just interviews.

          When the doctor holds my upper arm in his two hands,
he bows his head and listens as if he were waiting to hear
the song of a rare endemic bird no one has seen for centuries.
I start to speak, but he shakes his head, does not loosen his grip
on my arm, turns his fingers around the curve
of my skin and listens again.
I am afraid to clear my throat.

        <div class="content">
          Every year, the Hugo Awards announcement arrives with some dumb intercenine politics. Every year a small number of alt-right self-publishers try to game the ballot. Every year, they lose the awards. Every year, people call for the Hugos to change the way nominees are chosen. Every year the Hugos don&rsquo;t really change a thing.
This year, there are fewer of the alt-right on the nominee slate, but they&rsquo;re still there. Let&rsquo;s not let those jackasses obscure the fact that some great books are on this list, including Charlie Jane Anders&rsquo;s terrific debut novel All the Birds in the Sky.

Sponsor Eric Andrews-Katz's newly released novel Tartarus is a great romp through time, mythology, epic battles, and gay romance. Two siblings, descendants of Olympus, are dragged into ancient battles they didn't know they were responsible for.
It&rsquo;s a bold, entertaining work with an engaging story that bridges the old and the very new. We&rsquo;ve got a full chapter on our Sponsor&rsquo;s page for you to read, and find yourself gripped by this story.
