          People! Ask yourselves questions about your assumptions before you make best-of lists. Something like this, from Time magazine, is no longer acceptable in 2015:
.@TIME&#39;s best books of the year so far is 100% white: http://t.co/kllUcxQtoP
&mdash; Amanda Nelson (@ImAmandaNelson) July 31, 2015 Either Time is arguing that no person of color produced an amazing book this year, or they&rsquo;re admitting that they&rsquo;re only interested in books by white people. Neither option is good.

**Dear Cienna,**
My boyfriend and I are moving in together next week. I&rsquo;m very excited about this, and I&rsquo;m confident it&rsquo;s the right move. But we just had our first fight over a moving issue, and it&rsquo;s something I feel very strongly about: he wants to merge our book collections together.

          The excellent local literary magazine The James Franco Review, which has a blind submission policy intended to &ldquo;publish works of prose and poetry as if we were all James Franco, as if our work was already worthy of an editor’s attention,&rdquo; published an editorial today that all white editors — ourselves included! — should read and take to heart.

          The editors behind the excellent 33 1&frasl;3 series of books about albums have published all the information collected during their recent open submission process. It&rsquo;s a fascinating look at why the new-arrivals tables at your local bookstore are still dominated by books by and about men.
Of 605 book proposals received, 18.3 percent were written by female authors and 81.7 percent were by male authors. Not even twenty percent of submissions were from women!

          Short Run, the great small-press festival that local author Kelly Froh co-founded, is running a comics summer school every Monday night in August, with classes including how to computerize your art, screen printing, inking, watercolor, and drawing perspective. Each class is very affordable (Short Run is charging anywhere on a sliding scale from five to 20 dollars per class) and hosted by local cartooning greats including Eroyn Franklin, Robyn Jordan, and Max Clotfelter.

Friend of SRoB Rahawa Haile puts it best:
I mean do y&#39;all know how many lit mags have black women as publishers?

          Ask any writer: the two most difficult parts of the writing process are **1)** sitting down in the seat to write and **2)** figuring out what to write about. We *can't* help you focus on your work, but we *can* try to help you find inspiration in the city around you. That's what Seattle Writing Prompts is all about. These prompts are offered free to anyone who needs them; all the *Seattle Review of Books* asks in return is that you thank us in the acknowledgements when you turn it into a book.
