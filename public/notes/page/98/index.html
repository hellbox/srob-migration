        <div class="content">
          Samantha Pak at the Seattle Globalist has written a great report on diversity in Seattle&rsquo;s bookstore scene. It&rsquo;s a must-read.
 Seattle cartoonist Seth Goodkind discovered that someone plagiarized his artwork in order to win a contest put on by a music festival. When confronted, the artist apologized, but Goodkind wrote a wonderful letter explaining why plagiarism and contests for &ldquo;exposure&rdquo; harm artists. It&rsquo;s publicly posted on his Facebook wall and it&rsquo;s worth your time to read the whole thing.

          **Wednesday June 29: *Know the Mother* Reading **
Desiree Cooper’s short story collection *Know the Mother* examines motherhood in all its complicated variations — mothers of unborn children, mothers of adults, unhappy mothers. Seattle author Tara Conklin’s novel *The House Girl* is a novel about a runaway slave’s legacy. These two should deliver a fascinating conversation about race and gender. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free.

          **UPDATE**: Due to illness, the event celebrating author Dorthe Nors that was originally scheduled for this week has been canceled.
Headlines used to be an art form. Newspapers once hired people specifically to condense all the drama and nuance and vitality of a news story into five or six words that could grab readers at twenty paces.
Now the headline has become the domain of the social media expert, and their goals are much more modest: to divert you, however momentarily, from your Facebook news feed.

        <div class="content">
          When we started the Seattle Review of Books we had two options for trying to fund our content: put ugly ads on every page, or try something experimental with a sponsorship program. There were three points that made this an easy choice:
 Ad rates are falling across the internet. Many sites need to place more and more ad slots just to make the same amount of money they used to.

          Bruise: A Study
I. The bruise begs
in purple tones
for you to think
with your tongue,
for you to listen
with your hands
to the tremulous
voice of my skin.
II. I:
pressed it into my skin, ran into the corner of the counter on my way to make dinner, opened a door in to my shin, let you too close, slammed my finger in the car door, dropped a book on my toe, pushed the baby on the swing and didn’t watch her swing back, had surgery, pinched myself over and over like a pulse, slammed my head against a wall, ignored the warning signs, fell down stairs, fell into you, fell away from you when you pushed, found myself under something heavy.

          Sponsor SJ Watson is coming to Seattle! You probably know him from his thriller Before I Go to Sleep, which was made into a major motion picture by Rowan Joffee, starrting Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth. His latest book Second Life is out in paperback.
He&rsquo;s going to be at University Book Store in conversation with local writer Sonya Lea. If for some reason, you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with his work, a good place to start is our sponsors page, which has the entire first chapter from Second Life.

          We're thrilled to announce that our new Public Diversity Editor is (_drum roll!_): Vannessa Willoughby. Vanessa will be checking in with us twice a year or so, and reporting back on what we've done well, and where we can improve, in terms of diversity. If her name sounds familiar to you, perhaps it's because you've read her work at _The Toast_, _Bitch Media_, _Vice_, or _The Establishment_ (just to name a few).

          You can have the best-stocked bookstore in the world, but without booksellers it would be nearly useless. In fact, a bookstore exists in that space where the booksellers and literature intersect. We need them to direct us to books — classics, rarities, backlist, brand-new bestsellers — and explain why we should be interested in them.
The new team of booksellers at Seward Park’s Third Place Books bring decades of bookselling experience to the neighborhood, along with a few new booksellers.

          Road Tripping While Female Road trips have been a fascination for decades. They are trips with endless possibilities, a chance to venture into the unfamiliar to find yourself. But as Bernadette Murphy points out, the presence of female road-trippers in literature is severely lacking. Jack Kerouacs fill the niche of road narratives, and always with exciting adventures. With women, however, the narratives focus more on the dangers of the road.
