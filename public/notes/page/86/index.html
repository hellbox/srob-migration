        <div class="content">
          If you’ve published a kids’ book and you live in Seattle, the odds are good that you’ve been to Secret Garden Books. Either you’ve stopped by and introduced yourself because you know they have a rapt audience of children who pay close attention to their recommendations, or they’ve hosted your book launch party. The fact is, though Seattle is home to many terrific bookstore sections for young readers — Elliott Bay Book Company’s children’s section improved exponentially when the store moved from Pioneer Square to Capitol Hill; University Book Store has always had an incredibly diverse selection of titles and an adoring staff — Secret Garden is the city’s headquarters for children’s literature.

          The world’s first website went online 25 years ago 25 years and a week ago, Sir Tim Berners-Lee created a basic text page with some hyperlinks. It was a simple description of his “WorldWideWeb (W3)&rdquo; project. Cara McGoogan describes how he imagined the possibility of sharing information across the world. Here we are a quarter of a century later with over a billion websites online, using Google as a verb, and lamenting how many email accounts we have.

Near the beginning of a speech at the end of July, Donald Trump asked a hall full of people at the Air &amp; Space Museum in Denver: “Now, you know, should we read ‘The Snake?’” The room erupted with cheers. Trump, playing coy, asked again: “Should we? Does anyone know ‘The Snake?’” This was met with more cheers. Ever shameless, Trump asked again, “should we do it?” Still more cheers.

Dear Cienna,
**Recently, when I was watching the so-so *Pride and Prejudice and Zombies* movie, I was reminded of that fad when authors were inserting genre elements into works of classic fiction, like *Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters*.

          What a terrific email to get on a Thursday afternoon: Fantagraphics Books just announced that they&rsquo;re publishing the next book from Seattle cartoonist Ellen Forney. With her debut full-length graphic novel, Marbles, Forney eloquently shared her story as a bipolar artist. Rock Steady: Brilliant Advice From My Bipolar Life will offer autobiographical anecdotes and observations about &ldquo;how to overcome the hassle of meds, recognize red flags, and other tools from her own experience of 14 years of stability - all in comics form.

        <div class="content">
          Yes. God, yes.
Question-based headlines prompt a more negative response from readers as well as a more negative expectation of the story that follows compared to traditional news headlines, showed a report published on 9 August by the Engaging News Project. Remember the rule of thumb: if the headline is a question, the answer is almost always &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Headline writing has, in recent years, transformed from an art form — a good headline is a piece of writing that communicates with the piece as well as promoting the piece — into an impossibly dry chunk of information.

        <div class="content">
          Midway through the first issue of The Black Monday Murders, a master of finance lectures a class full of eager young geniuses who are about to enter the stock market. He asks them, “you want real advice? Here it is. The first million dollars you make is self-financed. You earn it with your blood. The cost is your health, your family, your friends. You pay, understand?” It’s not quite as splashy as Gordon Gekko’s “greed is good” monologue from Wall Street, but it’s a speech that resonates with the same kind of honesty.
