Political conventions are stories. Every four years, the two major political parties come together in conventions to tell us stories about America. These stories are almost always told in three parts: where we came from as a nation, what’s happening to us now, and finally, where we’re going.
The interesting part of collaborative storytelling is that when more than one person gathers to tell a story, that story becomes a living force, with its own agenda.

Dear Cienna,
**I’m friends with my local used bookseller. She recommends books to me, and I recommend books to her, and I sell books back to her, and everything is pretty great, for the most part.

Carla Hayden is the 14th Librarian of Congress! But, more importantly, she&rsquo;s the first female and first black Librarian of Congress &mdash; the thirteen before her have all been white men. Also, she&rsquo;s actually a librarian (with a doctorate in library science from U Chicago), which hasn&rsquo;t been the case since the 70s.

          One of my favorite things about Seattle novelist Matt Ruff is how his fans seem to be evenly split on their favorite book of his. Each of his books are so different from all the others that his fans have split into fiefdoms. Some prefer Fool on the Hill. Others have fallen hard for his newest, Lovecraft Country. The one that&rsquo;s most satisfying for me is Set This House in Order.

          We use a modified Chicago style here on the Seattle Review of Books. Recently, editing a piece that used the term ‘ebook’ sparked a discussion over which was better: ‘e-book’ or ‘ebook’? To our eyes, ‘e-mail’ seems antiquated (we use ‘email’), but are electronic books different? They are more modern, after all. If we have to designated something as electronic, as opposed to analog, is the hyphen still necessary?
Help us decide.

          Sam Henderson’s Magic Whistle comic recently transitioned from a one-cartoonist show to a humor anthology comic, and it’s very much been a delight. But you should know that the latest issue, number 3.2 — no, I have no idea what kind of numbering system he’s working on — opens with a comic that every Seattleite should read.
Seattle cartoonist Tom Van Deusen’s six-page strip “Bezos” opens with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos pouring himself a coffee in a nice-but-not-extravagant kitchen.

          This morning, APRIL Festival co-founder Willie Fitzgerald introduced us to the idea of Poetweet, a website that searches your Twitter feed and turns it into a poem. (The site is a very clever promotion for the B_arco Cultural Center in Brazil.) I ran the Seattle Review of Books Twitter feed through, and here&rsquo;s what happened:

          **Wednesday July 20: *Remembering Healing Celebrating* **
Five Seattle-area poets — Priscilla Long, Jack Remick, Holly Hughes, John Wright, and Bethany Reid — read new work about “the past, lost poets, extinct birds, lost loves, and extending and expanding the meanings of elegy.” One of the top three best uses of poetry is remembering.

        <div class="content">
          You can pinpoint the origins of Donald Ray Pollock’s literary genius directly to a town in Ohio called Knockemstiff. Pollock was born and raised there, and he worked in a nearby paper mill for three decades. With a population just under 60,000, Knockemstiff is the kind of town that you don’t typically find in contemporary American literary fiction; half-rotten by meth, starved for hope, and entirely broke, it’s about as far away from the world presented in Jonathan Franzen’s novels as you can imagine.
