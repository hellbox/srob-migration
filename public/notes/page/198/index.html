        <div class="content">
          You may have noticed that we published a wonderful poem by Kelli Russell Agodon this morning. It&rsquo;s the debut of a new SRoB feature: every Tuesday, we&rsquo;ll present a poem by a local poet.
Here&rsquo;s the way it works: we reach out to a poet and ask for a selection of poems to look over. We work with the poet to select the poem that&rsquo;s right for SRoB. We then publish the poem and pay the poet for their work.

          After I try to give you happiness

nettles, and jellyjars filled with broken glass.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not for the cottonhearted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is for the man who holds fire
between his fingers and calls it love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;We are burnt
&nbsp;&nbsp;toast and prism jam.
We are rubbing ourselves

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trying to make the stinging stop.
There are remedies everywhere—

          Seattle writer and editor Jaimee Garbacik has put out a call for writers and artists to contribute to The Ghosts of Seattle Past, an &ldquo;interactive art installation&rdquo; about remembering the disappearing landmarks of Seattle:
Share your memories of our lost spaces, whether from last week or the last century. Send your photographs, drawings, and memorabilia. Write just a few lines or submit a long-form essay celebrating a place you held dear.

          The Office of Arts &amp; Culture&rsquo;s Arts Beat blog just announced the name of Seattle&rsquo;s new Civic Poet. What&rsquo;s a Civic Poet, you ask? OAC explains that the new role &ldquo;serves as an ambassador for Seattle’s rich literary landscape and represents the city’s diverse cultural community,&rdquo; usually in the form of public appearances and workshops. It&rsquo;s a two-year appointment, and it pays $10,000. (Hooray for paying writers for their work!) Our newest Civic Poet is Claudia Castro Luna.

        <div class="content">
          Lisa Peet at Library Journal writes about some disappointing new Harris poll results:
In 2011, 18 percent of adults surveyed answered yes to the question “Do you think that there are any books which should be banned completely?” In the most current study, published July 8, 28 percent answered the same question in the affirmative—a ten point increase—with 24 percent of those surveyed unsure. This means nearly half of those surveyed are still convinced that no books should ever be banned, but the implications of the findings still deserve attention.

          MONDAY August can be a challenging month for readings in Seattle. Now that we’re in August, Town Hall is shuttered for a month for its yearly schedule of renovations — you can’t keep a place that old looking that good without a whole lot of TLC — and other readings series choke back on their offerings. So maybe it’s time to check in on some old faithful institutions, like Works in Progress, the Hugo House’s twice-monthly reading series.

          Our sincerest thanks to Janine A. Southard for sponsoring The Seattle Review of Books this week.
In the hilarious, and well-loved Cracked! A Magic iPhone Story (four stars on Amazon!), the award-winning Southard (a Seattle denizen) shows you how the geeks of Seattle live, provides a running and often-hilarious social commentary on today’s world, and reminds you that, so long as you have friends, you are never alone.
Help support The Seattle Review of Books by reading her excerpt and ordering the novel if you like what you read.

[The Last Days of Kathy Acker](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/hazlitt/feature/last-days-kathy-acker) Her books were also fever dreams of escape and reinvention, and Acker’s own forbidding physical appearance—she could look, alternately, like a deranged kewpie doll, a pirate from the future, an alien courtesan—embodied such transformations. She spent years turning her body, simultaneously a source of pain and possibility in her work and life, into a protective carapace. [Reverse Logic](http://unabridged.

          Every day, friend of the *SRoB* Rahawa Haile tweets a short story. She gave us permission to collect them every week.
And, this week, [Kevin Nguyen](https://twitter.com/knguyen) interviewed her about the project in the [Oyster Review](https://review.oysterbooks.com/p/TX8YT7y6m8cyRZxRoniuiG/one-short-story-every-day). (it’s worth reading the whole thing for her last line, but this quote here is pretty choice, too).
I am highlighting a short story every day by authors who aren’t white men because “diversity matters” deserves to be more than sentiment.
