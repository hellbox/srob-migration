          Is there a better lede than this in all of journalism this week? I think not:
Exalted writer Natsume Soseki has returned as an android 100 years after his death and is reciting his own work. In case you&rsquo;re worried about the world of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep coming true, video of the Soseki android indicates that a lot of progress needs to happen between the present day and a workable lifelike automaton:

          This year&rsquo;s Black List Awards, which celebrate the greatest unproduced screenplays, were announced yesterday. Coincidentally, two Black List winners share a very interesting muse. Here&rsquo;s a description of Kathy Charles&rsquo;s screenplay The Kings of Maine:
Living with his wife and child in a trailer while working as a janitor, Stephen King struggles with alcoholism and his own dark history as he attempts to complete Carrie. And here&rsquo;s the plot synopsis for Maximum King!

        <div class="content">
          Heidi MacDonald at the indispensible comics news blog The Beat reports on a petition to unseat Wonder Woman as an honorary ambassador at the United Nations. The petition blasts Wonder Woman&rsquo;s &ldquo;overtly sexualized image&rdquo; for &ldquo;not [being] culturally encompassing or sensitive.&rdquo; It seems that the petition was successful — Wonder Woman is no longer considered to be a UN ambassador, though it&rsquo;s unclear how any fictional character can serve as an ambassador in the first place.

          Many of the Girl Scout songs
extorted a smile, our servile mugging &mdash;
but this one we loved best.
Starring a calf being hauled in a minor key,
its refrain two mournful syllables: dona.
First came the long o &mdash; in induction/seduction
to join the animal&rsquo;s cargo cult, then came
the short a, when the calf turned to beef
with no last meal and no reprieve.
The gist of the lyric: that we could choose

Our sponsor this week is Conon Parks, and if you're a fan of weird adventures, twisted druggy paths through Seattle's political and social undergrounds, and reliving what the WTO protests were like through those filters, then you're going to love his novel _Empty Bottle of Smoke_
Read an excerpt from the first chapter on our sponsor’s page, and pick up a copy in person at Third Place Books, Left Bank Books, or Village Books in Bellingham.

  “After 17 years in Seattle, it's become obvious that I can't hike, I can't bike, and I can't ski. So I'm getting the fuck out,” Seattle poet Maged Zaher joked at his last Seattle-area reading before moving to Atlanta early next year.

          (Every Monday in December, we&rsquo;re asking a local bookseller which books they&rsquo;d like to receive for a holiday gift. Our second bookseller is Melissa Barnes, who works at University Book Store. Melissa chose Ada Twist, Scientist, by Andrea Beaty and David Roberts.)

After reading Iggy Peck, Architect and Rosie Revere, Engineer, I was dying to read this one, because the series is wonderful for parents and kids. I think it’s got a great positive message: Even though someone tells you can’t do something, you can.

          ‘They Are Slaughtering Us Like Animals’ It&#8217;s been a week of interesting and deliberate visual storytelling: this Time Magazine cover, for example, and this selection from the National Geographic 2016 photography contest winners.
But the week&#8217;s must-see is a breathtaking photo essay by Daniel Berehulak documenting the antidrug campaign launched by Philippine president President Rodrigo Dutert in June. In just over a month, Berehulak photographed 57 men and women killed by the police and by vigilantes for real or supposed drug crimes.
