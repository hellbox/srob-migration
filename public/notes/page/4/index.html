          Many thanks to Ruth Graham at Slate for citing our book club as the first example in her article about reading and resistance in the age of Trump:
Some independent bookstores, progressive media outlets, and activist groups have launched new clubs to meet the moment. In Seattle there’s “Reading Through It: A Post-Election Book Club.” (First selection: J.D. Vance’s [*Hillbilly Elegy*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/12/08/thank-you-for-coming-to-the-first-reading-through-it-book-club/), a memoir of growing up in a poor white family in what is now Trump country.

**Sunday July 2nd: Reading with Rover**
Fun fact: if you know a child who is having trouble learning how to read, have them practice reading to dogs. And if you don’t have any dogs in your life, bring them to this event, which features trained therapy dogs just waiting for kids to read to them.

          If you think writers like to gossip, you should spend some time with elected officials. Nobody — not even a well-lubricated novelist — loves to gab like a politician. I was at a cocktail party a while back when a certain public official was clearly sitting on a big, juicy secret. They tried to sound nonchalant as they dropped their intel on a tight circle of Seattle-area political figures: “did you hear?

          I read the first issue of Mother Panic, a comic from My Chemical Romance frontman Gerard Way&rsquo;s Young Animal imprint of DC Comics, when it was first released over half a year ago. I didn&rsquo;t think too much of it — the comic suffered from first-issue-itis, wherein a lot of things happened but we weren&rsquo;t told why we should care.
Last week, DC published the first collected volume of Mother Panic.

          You don’t often recognize the importance of a venue until it’s gone. If you’ve lived in Seattle for more than five years, you can probably name a now-extinct rock club or bar that played a significant role in your life. Odds are good that you didn’t even know you’d miss those places until they closed forever.
Town Hall Seattle is only temporarily closing its doors for a top-to-bottom remodel, but it’ll be out of commission for long enough that we’ll acutely feel its absence.

          Those special snowflakes in the so-called &ldquo;men&rsquo;s rights movement&rdquo; have targeted Australian bookstore Avid Reader Bookshop for sharing a post by feminist writer Clementine Ford. In response, Avid Reader&rsquo;s social media manager has been working overtime revealing the MRAs for the ridiculous babies they are:

&mdash; Avid Reader Bookshop (@avidreader4101) June 26, 2017 A customer delivered an &ldquo;anti-troll&rdquo; sour cream and walnut cake to Avid Reader&rsquo;s booksellers, which certainly seems like it should become a tradition when the Nattering Nabobs of Nincompoopery target an innocent bookstore for basically no reason.

          When I was a girl
I wanted to live
inside of one.
A wooden, small
place to hold me.
I was in love
with its bird
face. I imagined us
married. The dream
of domesticity. Keeping
house à la bric-a-brac
or conversation piece.
But time has told
what makes them tick.
More machinations
than magic. Dark
pastoral scenes
and a stiffness
crowns the eaves.
Clockmakers all carve
the same male game
