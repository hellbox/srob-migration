        <div class="content">
          The Man Booker Prize announced their longlist this morning. The criteria changed last year to be open to international authors writing in English; up until last year, it was solely a prize for writers from the UK commonwealth, Ireland, and Zimbabwe. The longlist is:
Bill Clegg (US) - Did You Ever Have a Family
Anne Enright (Ireland) - The Green Road
Marlon James (Jamaica) - A Brief History of Seven Killings

          The New Statesman interview with sci-fi great Michael Moorcock is absolutely worth reading, if just for all the punches thrown. Some quoteworthy moments:
Who really cares about spaceships and how rockets work? I don’t actually care about space at all. You had to plough through all this shit that people like Arthur [C Clarke] insisted on expositing to get to maybe five good images. and
We live in a Philip K Dick world now.

          The Daily Dot&rsquo;s Austin Powell and Nicholas White explain why the site is doing away with its comments section:
The general consensus is that we need to detoxify the Web—to make it a cleaner, nicer, safer, and more inclusive place to live and work. Of course, at the *Daily Dot*, we would like to see a more civil, compassionate Web, but we want to be careful that in the name of fostering civility, we do not inadvertently kill all dissention.

        <div class="content">
          KING 5 is reporting that local true crime writer Ann Rule has died. If you&rsquo;ve never read The Stranger Beside Me, about Rule&rsquo;s personal relationship with serial killer Ted Bundy, you really should. It&rsquo;s far and away her best book, and a classic of the true crime genre.
I wrote a snarky overview of Rule&rsquo;s writing back when I was the new kid at The Stranger, and while I regret the tone of the piece — I was so much younger then!

(*Nicola Griffith, best-known as the local author of* Hild*, published an astonishing blog post in late May of this year. Titled “[Books about women don’t win big awards: some data](http://nicolagriffith.com/2015/05/26/books-about-women-tend-not-to-win-awards/),” Griffith presented a number of striking charts demonstrating the gender split between winners of awards like the Pulitzer Prize, the Man Booker, the National Book Award, and the Newbery Medal over the last 15 years. Unsurprisingly, more men than women have won almost all of those awards.

          Monday: Tonight’s recommended event is the Seattle Spelling Bee at Cafe Racer, in which adults drink beer and try to spell words of varying difficulty. What could possibly go wrong?
Tuesday: The Literary Mixer, a monthly happy hour event, has been going on for a couple years now. (It started at Vermillion, but the event moved to the Hideout not so long ago.) The concept behind Literary Mixer is as simple and clear as the name of the event: bring the book you’re currently reading to the bar.

          Our sincerest thanks to Janine A. Southard for sponsoring The Seattle Review of Books this week.
In the hilarious, and well-loved Cracked! A Magic iPhone Story (four stars on Amazon!), the award-winning Southard (a Seattle denizen) shows you how the geeks of Seattle live, provides a running and often-hilarious social commentary on today’s world, and reminds you that, so long as you have friends, you are never alone.
Help support The Seattle Review of Books by reading her excerpt and ordering the novel if you like what you read.

          This made the rounds on Twitter today:
Oh my Ted Cruz. Oh my. (#5): pic.twitter.com/9ef7ThgsXr
&mdash; Jim Henley (@UOJim) July 26, 2015 Those only familiar with Watchmen through Zack Snyder’s visually slavish but emotionally hollow cinematic adaptation might not get the irony here. Rorschach was created by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons in the 1980s as an echo of the Steve Ditko character The Question. Ditko is a famous Objectivist, one who believes that heroic fiction should only follow the rules established by Ayn Rand in her fiction and essays.

          _(A collection of pieces we noted this week.)_
[Joe Gould's Teeth](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/joe-goulds-teeth) Jill Lepore writes in The New Yorker about the longest book ever written, and whether or not it actually existed.
There ought to be a “Danger” sign. Writers tumble into this story, and then they plummet. I have always supposed this to be because Gould suffered from hypergraphia. He could not stop writing. This is an illness, a mania, but seems more like something a writer might envy, which feels even rottener than envy usually does, because Gould was a toothless madman who slept in the street.
