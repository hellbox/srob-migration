Dear Cienna,
Flipping through my high school yearbook, I was confronted with the uncomfortable reminder that my favorite book in senior year — the book I told everyone they *had* to read — was *Fight Club*.

**Monday June 12th: *The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.* Reading**
Seattle novelist Neal Stephenson’s follow-up to the magisterial *Seveneves* is a co-authored novel with Nicole Galland. It’s about a language expert who gets wrapped up in a secret government agency over some documents which supposedly prove that magic has always existed.

I just bought it last night, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that Atlas #1 is the ugliest comic book I own. Only the cover, a sensitive piece by Anders Nilson featuring the titular hero holding a charred corpse while floating in a smoggy yellow haze, is aesthetically pleasing.
But flip past the cover, and the rest of this book is ugly as sin: the coloring is garish and sloppy, the art style is childlike and aggressive, and the writing is opportunistic and so drenched in irony that it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if it&rsquo;s a joke, or a joke about a joke, or if it&rsquo;s supposed to be taken entirely straight.

We had some identification problems at last night’s Reading Through It book club at Third Place Books Seward Park. Someone would be talking about “him” as a bully, or an ideological vacuum, or an agent of chaos. We’d discuss “his” failure to behave as a normal leader, and his inability to consider his own nation as a member of an international community.
And then someone else would interrupt with a question for the sake of clarification: this “him” you’re referring to — are you talking about Vladimir Putin, or are you talking about Donald Trump?

Yesterday, when I read former FBI director James Comey&rsquo;s prepared statement to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I was struck by one particular passage:
A few moments later, the President said, "I need loyalty, I expect loyalty." I didn't move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner.

**Wednesday June 7th: Reading Through It: The Man Without a Face **
Every month, the Seattle Weekly and the Seattle Review of Books team up to bring you a current-events book club for our Trump-possessed times. This month’s selection, unfortunately, turned out to be especially timely in this era of light treason. Join us as we discuss Masha Gessen’s The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin.

          Buried in the belly of Pike Place Market, Chin Music Press’s showroom might just be the best-kept secret of a bookstore in Seattle. It’s a dreamy little shop, carrying just a few dozen titles, almost entirely all published by the local press. You’ll know a Chin Music title when you see one: it’s usually the gorgeous hardcover in the front of the bookstore that you just can’t keep yourself from touching.

          HUGE congratulations are due to Seattle Review of Books contributor Nisi Shawl, whose amazing novel Everfair was just announced as a John W. Campbell Memorial Award finalist, alongside some incredible books by Colson Whitehead, Ben Winters, Don DeLillo, and Kij Johnson.
 Are you an aspiring graphic novelist? Here&rsquo;s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: The Office of Arts and Culture is offering $50,000 to &ldquo;commission one artist or artist team to research, write and illustrate a fictionalized historic graphic novel in relation to the history, story and significance of the Georgetown Steam Plant, a National Historic Landmark.

          Just a quick note to remind you that tomorrow night at 7 p.m., we&rsquo;ll be at Third Place Books Seward Park to discuss Masha Gessen&rsquo;s The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin. Reading this book at this particular time in history has been especially weird: without mentioning Trump at all, the book has been incredibly informative about current events.
Also, I&rsquo;d urge you to listen to today&rsquo;s episode of the Ezra Klein Show, which features a brand-new long interview with Gessen.
