        <div class="content">
          This Saturday is Free Comic Book Day, the day when, duh, participating comics shops give away free comics to anyone who walks in. You can find the comic shop closest to you here. Some things to know:
 If you’re looking for a good book, try the FCBD edition of the first issue of *Archie*, by Mark Waid and Fiona Staples. I reviewed it when it came out back in July of last year.

Last week, we interviewed new-to-Seattle author [Neal Bascomb](http://nealbascomb.com/) for [our New Hire column.]( http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/26/new-hire-neal-bascomb-found-a-community-of-writers-in-seattle/) Yesterday, Bascomb’s newest book, a non-fiction Norwegian World War II espionage thriller called [*The Winter Fortress*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780544368057), was officially published. Bascomb is hosting a [launch party at Hugo House tomorrow night](https://hugohouse.org/event/book-launch-party-neal-bascombs-winter-fortress). We talked about the pleasures and pains of research and why his book might appeal to fans of the movie *Red Dawn*.
**Did moving to Seattle make the research part of your job more difficult?

Seattle is right now trapped in the nether realm between openly mourning the past (see editor Jaimee Garbacik’s Ghosts of Seattle Past project) and openly agitating for the future (see the conversation about how quickly we can get light rail up and running to Ballard.) Tonight, the Hugo House finds itself exactly in between those two polar Seattle extremes, as a kind of Schrödinger’s nonprofit writing center. In twelve days, the House moves to its temporary headquarters on First Hill as a two-year guest of the Frye Art Museum while the old structure is demolished to make way for a shiny new facility at the base of five stories’ worth of condos.

        <div class="content">
          Okay, so yesterday the GiveBIG website collapsed and died a very public death. Dozens, or hundreds, or thousands of Seattleites who wanted to donate money to their favorite Seattle-area nonprofits were unable to, and those nonprofits were forced to choose between either waiting out the computer problems or sending people to their own sites to donate. (The problem with the latter choice: donations directly to nonprofits wouldn&rsquo;t have access to the large amount of matching funds that are applied to donations through the GiveBIG site.

        <div class="content">
          We&rsquo;re always excited to promote GiveBIG every year, but this year it seems that the website is having serious issues. As in, it&rsquo;s impossible to donate through the GiveBIG site right now. Many nonprofits are reporting not receiving donations in over an hour, and the Seattle Foundation&rsquo;s calls for people to &ldquo;refresh&rdquo; the site don&rsquo;t seem to be working.
In short: GiveBIG this year is pretty much a clusterfuck. There will for sure be hell to pay in the coming days — this is a big day for Seattle&rsquo;s nonprofit community and this will surely affect the annual income of local organizations across the board.

          This is supremely hard; I don&rsquo;t know how, exactly, I can in good conscience just select three literary nonprofits out of that long list of worthy organizations. But this year, I&rsquo;m choosing my nonprofits based on extraordinary need: these three organizations are about to enter times of great change, and so they could use your time and attention and money a little more than ever. In alphabetical order, they are:

          GiveBig is here! You&rsquo;ve already read Paul&rsquo;s overview on the day, with the list of books-and-literacy themed giving. But we thought personalized picks might help too.
So, here&rsquo;s where I think you can do the most good. My theme? Funding the education of writers you will be reading in the future. Also: watch for Paul&rsquo;s picks, coming at noon.

          A winner, a swinger, a ringer.
A looker, a loser, an up-on-his-lucker.
Someone looser, someone tighter,
definitely not an all-nighter. A whiner,
wine-swiller, someone to entertain
the fundraiser chicken dinner.
Someone with handlers, another with baggage,
one with the umbrellas, another with the rain.
Different faces, symmetrical and un-.
A smoker, a non-, a joker, a song.
Two lungs, a heart, a head, a leg, a leg.
The drink, the dregs.
