Of course, there’s more to a bookstore than readings. As John Marshall reflects on his time with Open Books, he’s been thinking about how much he’s learned from his customers. “I have been educated in so many directions by articulate folks possessing a vast array of aesthetics,” he says. He learns about poets and events from customers all the time, and all those many voices have helped make Open Books a two-decade conversation, with the kind of “crackling moments of wit,” he says, “that make life glow.

          Adam Liptak at the New York Times says the &ldquo;Supreme Court’s brief order left in place an appeals court decision that [Google&rsquo;s scanning of millions of books was] a “fair use” of the authors’ work, ending a legal saga that had lasted more than a decade.&rdquo;

          'I Don't Know Whether to Kiss You or Spank You': A Half Century of Fear of an Unspanked Woman Yet another longform piece on the infantalization of women due to the patriarchy as represented by media expressions of spanking as punishment (but not sexual pleasure). Jeez. Seems like we&rsquo;re getting ten of these a week, these days. Andrew Heisel takes us well-in-hand with this one, from Jezebel.
 In early 1946, a woman from Carmel, California wrote the Hollywood fan magazine _Screenland_ to say how much she had enjoyed the recent Christmas release _Frontier Gal_ &mdash; not just for its lovely performers and dazzling Technicolor vistas, but for saving her marriage by teaching her husband to spank her.

          I thought I might go nuts if I read another article about how a woman writer balances her art and family commitments, but Danielle Dutton’s ability to balance multiple projects verges on superhuman. So I had to ask.
Dutton is the founder and publisher of Dorothy, a Publishing Project; a tenure-track professor; author of two novels and a collection of short stories as well as a doting mother with the “best kid ever.

My husband died. It was a few years ago, so the shock is over and I&rsquo;m used to the idea of living my life on my own — I keep busy and have lots of friends and hobbies.

Celebrate National Poetry Month through song, contemporary forays into poetic performance and collaborations between sound artists and writers in this event. Curated by Redmond Poet Laureate Shin Yu Pai. And here are the performers:

Singpore-based comic artist Sonny Liew came to Seattle last Monday, promoting his new graphic novel _The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye_ ([we reviewed the book that day](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-man-who-paints-tigers-on-an-island/ "The Seattle Review of Books &mdash; The man who paints tigers on an island"), as well). I sat down with him at Elliott Bay Book Company to talk about his art, the book, politics in Singapore, and his inspirations. This is an edited transcript of the talk.

        <div class="content">
          Last week’s big book news was obviously the first issue of the Black Panther from Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreeze, but there was another debut that deserves your attention, too. Nick Spencer and Steve Lieber’s new series The Fix is a crime comic with relatively small stakes, but it’s entertaining as hell — funny, dirty, and charming all at once.
Spencer and Lieber earned a cult following with their work on Marvel’s Superior Foes of Spider-Man series, which was a funny heist comic featuring some D-List Spider-Man villains.
