        <div class="content">
          Spokane-by-way-of-Seattle author Kate Lebo&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;A Prayer to Cathy McMorris Rodgers for Intercession on My Behalf&rdquo; at Blood Orange Review is exactly what a political poem should be: it is reasonable, and passionate, and meaningful. The poem is aimed directly at McMorris Rodgers, who is Lebo&rsquo;s Congressional representative, and it&rsquo;s a plea for the congresswoman to remember everyone that she represents in the House. On this week when House Republicans seem to be considering, yet again, the repeal of Obamacare, the poem lands with a special weight.

        <div class="content">
          Every year, the Seattle Public Library chooses one book to headline its “Seattle Reads” program. The idea is to get as many copies of a single title into as many hands as possible, to bring the author to as many of Seattle’s neighborhoods as they can in a single week, and to examine a book thoroughly. It’s a noble idea and it raises some interesting questions about place and readership: does Ballard, say, read a book differently than Rainier Valley?

          This morning, tickets to the 2017 edition of the Seattle International Film Festival go on sale for SIFF members. This year&rsquo;s SIFF is huge (400 films from 80 countries) and diverse. Highlights include a series spotlighting films from nations on President Trump&rsquo;s travel ban list, an education series for kids, and a heavy focus on Northwest filmmakers, women directors, and films that as of yet have no established North American premiere dates.

Tomorrow night at Third Place Books Seward Park at 7 pm, I hope you&rsquo;ll join Seattle Weekly editor-in-chief Mark Baumgarten and myself and my Seattle Review of Books cofounder Martin McClellan in a discussion of Jonathan Haidt&rsquo;s amazing book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion.
The May installment of our Reading Through It book club is more theoretical and less interested in current events.

          I walk the narrow pedestrian passage
illumined so its girdered ribs show
like names on a ledger. Every step
sudden and trochaic &mdash; the beginning
of facts. Of being here.
I look up and see the moon
is brandishing its ghosts. What is
here and not here. What is
a face in the sky. What breaks
the shape of the known and obvious.
If I could say it, I would say

          Back when he was just a presidential candidate, I wrote about Donald Trump&rsquo;s love of the poem &ldquo;The Snake.&rdquo;. Over the weekend, President Trump read the poem again. As Chris Cillizza points out, the poem has a very different meaning, now that Trump is Commander-in-Chief.

Sponsor Brian McKreevy's new novel _The Lights_ is being released next week. It's a philosophical inquiry into the nature of how we connect in our most intimate bonds &mdash; and, bonus, it starts when gifted writer Leda Galvan moves to Austin to join an MFA program. It's an examination of love and art, all set in Texas among aspirational writers.
That&rsquo;s something McKreevy knows all about &mdash; he was a James Michener Fellow in fiction and screenwriting at the University of Texas.
