          What Would Happen If We Just Gave People Money? A minimum guaranteed income is a hot topic right now, in advance of technological changes, like self-driving trucks, that are likely to put huge amounts of people out of work in very short order. That will be a huge hit on an already stretched-thin safety net. What if, instead, we just gave people money? That way, they can survive, they can get by, they can live a decent life, and have the resources to be trained in other work they will find more fulfilling.

          After Seattle and San Diego, Portland gets the &ldquo;honor&rdquo; of hosting the third Amazon Books brick-and-mortar store.
“We are excited to be bringing Amazon Books to Washington Square, and we are currently hiring store managers and associates. Stay tuned for additional details down the road.” Who&rsquo;s going to be the first person to showroom a book at Portland&rsquo;s Amazon Books and buy it from Powell&rsquo;s?

 The Private Eye Writers of America have announced the nominees for their annual awards, the Shamuses. Local nominees include J.A. Jance and Ingrid Thoft, who were both nominated in the &ldquo;Best Private Eye Novel&rdquo; category.
 Have you read the Neu Jorker, the spot-on New Yorker parody produced by comedy writers from The Onion, the Late Show with David Letterman, and more? It&rsquo;s eerie how good this magazine is, right down to the phony ads.

          In 2010 and early 2011, writer Brian Michael Bendis and his frequent collaborator, artist Alex Maleev, published the first five issues of a comic titled Scarlet. Bendis and Maleev have always been ideal collaborators: something about Bendis’s propensity for including too much Mamet-style dialogue on every page works well with Maleev’s photorealism, which often fails to convey action in any convincing way. Their comics — particularly their long run on Daredevil — tend to be wordy dramas that feel more like plays than the usual action movies you’ll find in superhero comics.
