        <div class="content">
          James Baldwin is at the center of the new documentary I Am Not Your Negro, but it’s not a biography. Instead, it’s an essay about the history of race in America composed posthumously from Baldwin’s notes. Baldwin is at the center of the film; it’s constructed around his narration (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) and his televised appearances serve as supplementary arguments. He shares his own story, but he only uses it as an example of the larger African-American experience.

On Friday night, a "mysterious benefactor" purchased 50 copies of [*1984*] to be given away free at Booksmith in Haight-Ashbury.

          Even if the word “remainder” doesn’t mean anything to you, you likely have spent time browsing remaindered books. You can find remainders in most large bookstores—they’re the new-looking books that sell for used-book prices, often stacked on tables near the front door. They’re basically the second-run movie theaters of the publishing world—outdated overstock sold for dirt-cheap to distributors a year or more after the title first went on sale.
Remainders — also called bargain books — are big business for bookstores.

Using the word-mashing logic of SeaTac, we should have named the lake to our east SeaBelle. To the North, perhaps we could make a region called SeaEver, and perhaps our ferry runs could be SeaBain, SeaVash, and SeaBrem.

        <div class="content">
          Charlie Warzel at BuzzFeed:
As Amazon positions itself as an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, inside the company, dozens of employees are voicing deep concern about another political issue: Amazon’s choice to advertise on Breitbart.com.
According to internal emails and documents obtained by BuzzFeed News, employees have begun voicing concerns about the company’s advertising relationship with the provocative far-right website. Some piled on to a complaint ticket in Amazon’s internal issue escalation system urging the company to sever its relationship with Breitbart, the site that former editor and now–Senior White House Advisor Steve Bannon once called “the platform for the alt-right.

        <div class="content">
          &ldquo;I dreamed that my passport was a book of prayers,&rdquo; Sherman Alexie writes in his new poem &ldquo;Autopsy&rdquo; at Early Bird Books. &ldquo;Autopsy&rdquo; is a deeply political poem that was born from this political moment, like Elisa Chavez&rsquo;s &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; and Claudia Castro Luna&rsquo;s &ldquo;Am I not an immigrant?,&rdquo; both of which were published right here on the Seattle Review of Books. It is incredibly heartening to see poets making something out of this despair, and to see the general public respond to these poems with such enthusiasm.
