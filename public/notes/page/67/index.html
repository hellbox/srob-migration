          Wednesday October 26th: The Hidden Lives of Owls Reading
Look, fuck the election; it’s time to talk about owls. Leigh Calvez is an owl expert who will explain why owls are simultaneously cooler and more disgusting than the Harry Potter books ever let on. Maybe she’ll also explain why they’re always wearing graduation caps in cartoons even if they haven’t graduated college.

        <div class="content">
          In just five years, Seattle Lit Crawl has become more than just a bookish pub crawl — it’s now the fever-pitch climax of autumn, the busiest night of the busiest time of the year for literary Seattle. On the evening of October 27th, 35 readings (each lasting 45 minutes, with programs starting at 6, 7, 8, and 9 pm) will unfold all over downtown, First Hill, and Capitol Hill. You can find a full listing of all the readings at litcrawl.

          Novelist Paul Beatty has won the Man Booker prize for The Sellout, his deeply satirical novel about race in our country. Great news, and congratulations to Beatty. This is the third year the prize has been open to writers of any nationality, and Beatty is the first American author to take it.
Before there was a Seattle Review of Books, co-founder Paul Constant reviewed the book for our good friends over at Seattlish:

        <div class="content">
          In advance of tonight&rsquo;s #JournalismSoWhite event at Town Hall, we wanted to recall our own diversity reports, written by our Public Diversity Editor, Vanessa Willoughby.
We published Vanessa&rsquo;s first report on September 7th of this year. We think her observations and analysis of our work on this issue were right on-point.
As she pointed out: &ldquo;Whether it be diverse representation in film or a diverse workplace, sometimes diversity doesn’t necessarily mean equality.

          It&rsquo;s true that Donald Trump has admitted to never reading books. But in case you think he doesn&rsquo;t care about books, please note that the Huffington Post revealed that Trump bought $300,000 in small donations to his campaign on books last month. Of course, the books he bought were copies of his ghost-written memoir The Art of the Deal. Weirdly, Trump also offered signed copies of The Art of the Deal as a fundraiser, even though&hellip;

The Vixen pinks his way through whiskers,
strikes a nice plié,
then knocks a shot of Jäger back,
and drops some Fourier.
The shaven Lion shyly strides
beside his own conceit:
a guileless wilding
twice defiled, but innocent and sweet.
Mama Panda and her Pup
(wily as Montaigne)
splay their limbs in slick abandon,
rolling through the rain.

The book received great marks in Kirkus and the Village Voice, but it&rsquo;s what you think that matters most, which is why a full story is such a treat. Be sure to indulge yourself, and if you like it, click through to pick up the book.

          Michael Schaub at the L.A. Times writes:
Lucia Perillo, a poet known for her sense of humor and her writing about living with multiple sclerosis, died on Oct. 16 at the age of 58 in Olympia, Wash., her publisher Copper Canyon Press confirms. Her most recent book, “Time Will Clean the Carcass Bones,” was published in February. Perillo was a MacArthur &ldquo;Genius&rdquo; Fellowship winner, her work was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize, and she was no stranger to the Seattle literary scene.
