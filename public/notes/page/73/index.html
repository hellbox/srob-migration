          If you&rsquo;re not aware of the @manwhohasitall Twitter feed, I&rsquo;d encourage you to follow it. It&rsquo;s a simple premise — reversing the gender on common ignorant sexist statements — that pays off in so many enjoyable ways. Some examples:
"Men shouldn't run for president because of their hormones," says male CEO, Paul, 60. Interesting that this comment comes from a man. "I don't mind being called a gentleman driver because it's true, I'm a gentleman and I'm a driver.

          This ABC News story certainly isn&rsquo;t terrifying or anything.
The executive director of the Kansas City library system says he is "outraged" that prosecutors continue to pursue charges against a man who was arrested after asking pointed questions during a library discussion about the Middle East peace process and an employee who tried to intervene.

          So far as travel resources go, the website Atlas Obscura isn’t stodgy like Frommer’s, and it’s not overly obsessed with shopping like Lonely Planet guides. Instead, it’s interested in bizarre destinations and singular geographical points of interest: on their site right now, you’ll find offers to visit Icelandic sorcerers who perform “evil-ridding” ceremonies and a map marking the homes of heroes of children’s literature including Beverly Cleary’s Portland-based Ramona Quimby.

        <div class="content">
          This year&rsquo;s Nobel Prize for literature will be announced on October 13th, which is later than usual for weird calendar reasons. This piece at The Local says the betting markets think Haruki Murakami is a favorite to win the prize this year. Since Philip Roth retired, Haruki Murakami has always topped the betting markets, and — spoiler alert — he has never won the Nobel Prize. (Neither has Roth, for that matter, and he was the favorite for at least a decade before Murakami took over the position.

        <div class="content">
          Last week, I shared the news that a new California law was going to require vendors in the business of selling collectibles to provide certificates of authenticity. I linked to a post by a California bookstore arguing that the law was going to be difficult — if not impossible — to obey.
But the law blog Scrivener&rsquo;s Error sets that bookstore straight: seems that the California law is much more reasonable than the booksellers believed.

They have three events coming up to celebrate the launch: a launch party this Saturday, the 8th, an artists reception this Sunday the 9th, and another event in November.

        <div class="content">
          Over the weekend, the New York Review of Books — no relation — published a piece of reportage that supposedly outed the author behind the pseudonym Elena Ferrante. Considering that Ferrante is an international bestseller and a global literary sensation, this piece immediately became an internet phenomenon.
I’m not going to link to the piece, and I recommend you do not read it. I have no interest in who Elena Ferrante really is, and I don’t believe there’s a single good reason why NYRB should have uncovered her name.
