**Dear Cienna,**
I have a nasty secret. I really like to pretend I&rsquo;ve read books that I&rsquo;ve never actually read. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll be at a party and someone will start talking to me about — here&rsquo;s a recent example — Gore Vidal.

          Tomorrow, the Short Run Comix &amp; Arts Festival will be happening at the Fisher Pavillion at Seattle Center from 11 am to 6 pm. If you&rsquo;re looking for a ridiculously long list of all the exhibitors at the show, you can find that here. But the best way to go to Short Run is to not have a plan. Bring some cash and walk around. If you see something you like, buy it.

        <div class="content">
          A few weeks ago, Facebook made news with some gossip that the site was trying to find a more nuanced way to respond to posts than simply “Liking” everything. The thinking, supposedly, was that it is inappropriate to “Like” a post announcing a loved one’s death, and people would prefer some other wordless way to show support. This was presented in the media as a novel problem, one created by the relatively new innovation that is Facebook.

We&rsquo;ve had record traffic with our library coverage &mdash; you could reach out to that crowd to tell them about your book or event. People are starting to rely on the Seattle Review of Books for literary coverage; your sponsorship would help make that possible.
How&rsquo;s the sponsorship model going so far? Really well! Out of 27 original weeks we opened in this block of availability, only 5 are left.

Today's the birthday of American folk-artist and quilter [Harriet Angeline Powers](http://www.earlywomenmasters.net/powers/), born October 29, 1837, the "mother of African-American quilting." Her story quilts depict bible stories and astronomical events in striking graphic panels. Two quilts have survived and are on display at the Smithsonian and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston:

          As I noted in my Week in Readings post on Monday, Ta-Nehisi Coates reads from his new book, Between the World and Me, tonight as part of the 2015-2016 Seattle Arts &amp; Lectures season. The reading is long since sold out; if you don&rsquo;t have tickets already, you are out of luck.
But allow me to take this opportunity to tell you something: if you haven&rsquo;t yet read Coates&rsquo;s book Between the World and Me, you are missing out on the most important book of the year.

        <div class="content">
          The first issue of Art Ops, a new comic by Shaun Simon and Mike Allred, contains one indelible image: Mona Lisa, shopping in a contemporary grocery store. She’s wearing a bright yellow hoodie, and she’s buying cans of soup — Campbell’s soup, of course, an obvious shout-out to Andy Warhol, who has a cameo elsewhere in the issue. The young man running the checkout counter screws up the nerves to ask her out: “So, Lisa, I was wondering if you…if you wanted to catch a movie or something.

        <div class="content">
          In an unusually well-attended board meeting Wednesday evening, the Library Board of Trustees voted unanimously to halt implementation of the proposed logo and name change last night. This stops the proposed implementation of the brand and name change, which would have cost $570,000 over the next two years. However, it was unclear — both to the audience, and it seemed to the board itself — what exactly the implications of this vote might be on the work already generated by the rebranding process.

          Brandon Macz at the Capitol Hill Times published Weinstein A+U&rsquo;s first designs for the new building that will be built on the site where Hugo House now stands. The design for the new Hugo House includes &ldquo;a reading lounge along a window wall at 11th Avenue that will feel like a library&rdquo; and a &ldquo;long gallery [that] will lead to a performance space, which is planned to have telescoping bleacher seating for large readings,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;a café themed to match Hugo House.
