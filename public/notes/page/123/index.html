        <div class="content">
          I am all for the idea of states naming official books. (Make Way for Ducklings is, adorably, Massachusetts&rsquo;s official children&rsquo;s book.) But I&rsquo;m not a fan of this move:
Tennessee is poised to make history as the first state in the nation to recognize the Holy Bible as its official book. The problem is, of course, Tennessee lawmakers aren&rsquo;t just naming a state book by doing this; they&rsquo;re effectively naming Christianity the official state religion.

          It&rsquo;s funny how much we ate &mdash;
we couldn&rsquo;t stop.
First dinner, then desert,
then the plates and the table.
At the show, she ate the stage,
I swallowed the microphones.
Back at the room we ate the chairs
the shower and the television.
Naked, breasts poised like the dark mystery
at the center of faith, she devoured the bed &mdash;
nothing left.
Behind her, arms around her victorious stomach,

          Sponsor Floating Bridge Press is back to feature a great work from Maya Jewell Zeller, titled Yesterday, the Bees. Zeller&rsquo;s piece was a finalist in the 2015 chapbook competition, a work that looks at parenting, and being a part of a family.
We have two poems from the work on our sponsors page for you to read. Be sure to look, and click through to their website to find out more about Zeller&rsquo;s work, and the other chapbook winners.

        <div class="content">
          Now that I am home and eating real meals again, there is time to mull over all the cringey moments of AWP 2016. Like when I bum-rushed Kevin Young in order to gush about how much my middle school students loved his poem “Ode to Gumbo.” I actually said, “you’ve got fans in the 8th grade, Kevin.” And then ran away. Or when I stood right behind Rachel Kushner at a small private reception, stared at her hair and, like a super creep, didn’t say anything.

          *Editor's note: critic [Tom LeClair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_LeClair) sent this letter to the editor in response to [Paul Constant's blog post](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/29/book-reviewer-predictably-upset-at-authors-big-advance/) on LeClair's* Daily Beast *piece titled "[Will Commercialit Ruin Great Fiction?](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/27/will-commercialit-ruin-great-fiction.html)"*
In the 40 years I’ve been writing book reviews for national periodicals, it’s rare that one of my reviews is reviewed. In a recent post, Paul Constant called my review of Sweeney’s The Nest in the Daily Beast “unfair.” “Wrong” I could silently accept, but “unfair” seems unfair.

As the Seattle Review of Books reported back at the beginning of March, John Marshall, owner of the Wallingford poetry-only bookshop Open Books, announced that he was retiring from the bookselling business. In an email to his customers, Marshall indicated that he wanted to sell the bookstore, that sales at Open Books were still strong, and that he believed a new owner could even make something more of the store.

          Correspondant Rachel Kessler agreed to be our eyes-on-the-ground at the AWP festival this year. Join us for her daily updates as the conference unfolds.
The final day of AWP produces a noticeable thrum from inside the hive. Up and down the teal conference center hallways 14,000 attendees power walk and talk and gesticulate wildly, swinging beige tote bags with great vigor. Drinking fountains were in short supply, although the dehydrated could quench their thirst at one of the many cocktail carts that popped up at noon throughout the venue.
