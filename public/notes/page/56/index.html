Dear Cienna,
After a long string of rejections, I’m happy to report that a short story of mine has finally been accepted. Unfortunately, it was actually accepted at *two* literary magazines, neither of which allow for simultaneous submissions.

This time of year, everybody does it. I’ll be doing it soon myself: Making up lists. Second-guessing my picks. Justifying them.

I can&rsquo;t stand raccoons. With their tiny little hands and the way they clamber, brazen and unafraid, into human spaces, they unsettle me in a way that no insect or snake ever could. There is just enough human in raccoons to be recognizeable, but just enough snout and fang and fur to make them alien. A live raccoon sighting will always raise my hackles, and raccoon corpses by the side of the road have never invoked my sympathy.

        <div class="content">
          Seattle alternative comics publisher Fantagraphics Books, which has always been vehemently anti-superhero, is going to publish a superhero comic from classic mainstream comics creators and contemporary alternative cartoonists called All-Time Comics. Two thoughts:
 This looks like a lot of fun. And: Now that Fantagraphics publisher Gary Groth is in the superhero business, hell has definitely frozen over.

          Great crowd for the first Reading Through It book club! Thanks to @seattleweekly and @thirdplacebooks, and everybody who showed up to talk about Hillbilly Elegy

Nearly a hundred people came out to Third Place Books Seward Park to discuss J.D. Vance’s memoir Hillbilly Elegy for the first Reading Through It book club last night, and most everyone who spoke seemed to agree that the book was not, strictly speaking, good.

        <div class="content">
          Zanadu Comics, the 41-year-old comics shop on 3rd Avenue downtown, has launched a crowdfunding campaign on GoFundMe to raise $80,000 to keep the lights on and the doors open. The shop cites &ldquo;increased rent costs, and unfortunate city developments which includes a forced relocation due to building renovation late next year&rdquo; as the reason for the campaign. It&rsquo;s especially heartwarming to see that Pike Place Market comics shop Golden Age Collectables, has donated $500 to the campaign, leaving a comment that &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in this together!
