        <div class="content">
          Jean Riley wrote a great roundup of the state of independent bookselling in Seattle for Seattle Magazine.  The past few decades have been challenging for independent bookstores, with each decade seeming to bring on a new threat: First, there were the huge chains that dominated the retail landscape. Then, there was the shift to online shopping, followed by the invention of electronic–reading devices. And now, the entry of Amazon into brick-and-mortar territory with its first store in Seattle.

        <div class="content">
          Unlike a lot of male superhero comics readers of my generation, I’ve never been a fan of the Punisher. I always preferred my superheroes to be aspirational. Murdering criminals in the street is something that only criminals do. The Punisher, to me, has always demonstrated the ugly, conservative side of superheroes, where the bad guys are an other—monstrous, irredeemable, worthy of nothing but scorn.
Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips’s new comic Kill or Be Killed is a series about a vigilante who kills criminals, but it’s not a Punisher-style glorification of the genre.

        <div class="content">
          Look, I don&rsquo;t wanna get into a fight over Bob Dylan. But Bob Dylan is inarguably world-famous. Books and countless articles have been written about Bob Dylan&rsquo;s genius. Bob Dylan has won an obscene number of awards. He&rsquo;s made a lot of money.
And I&rsquo;m just saying: Joan Didion still does not have a Nobel Prize in Literature. Or Claudia Rankine. Or Marilynne Robinson. If this was the year for an American to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, seeing one of those names in all the news reports would have made my morning a much happier one.

          Yesterday, Artist Trust announced that Seattle poet Quenton Baker received the $15,000 James W. Ray Venture Project Award, which &ldquo;support[s] artistic excellence and the development of new ideas through individual and collaborative projects.&rdquo; Baker is going to devote the prize money to a full-length project about the only successful large-scale slave rebellion in United States history. We are so excited to see this book.
Baker, who is also a teacher, will publish his first full-length collection, This Glittering Republic, next year with Willow Books.

          We caught wind of this event too late for tomorrow&rsquo;s reading calendar, but it&rsquo;s too cool not to mention. The 2016 Taste of Iceland festival is happening this week, and it features a free reading at KEXP&rsquo;s brand-spanking new headquarters (472 1st Ave. N) on Friday, October 14th. Iceland is one of the most literary nations on earth, with more authors per capita than anywhere else, and it&rsquo;s got a long, rich and unbroken tradition of literature that you should learn more about.
