        <div class="content">
          &ldquo;A branch of the Seattle Public Library is named after two African-American icons who never set foot in the Pacific Northwest,&rdquo; begins this report by historian Feliks Banel at MyNorthwest.com. The branch in question, of course, is the The Douglass-Truth Library.
 Ijeoma Oluo needs your help to keep her site The Establishment running:
  It has been life-affirming to see so many writers bless us with some of their first professionally published pieces — women writers of color, trans writers, queer writers, disabled writers — talking about some of the most important issues of the day with actual lived experience.

          My father was de-boned as a child.
The trick was to use a sharp knife,
steady hands and always begin at the neck. With luck, my grandparents
were able to remove his spine intact.
But all-muscle can’t hold love upright.
You see strength needs something
to settle itself around. Boneless men
can only stay where they are bent to.
My father was made to cut
his own beatings off a tree,

Thanks to our Puppet-in-Chief, everyone&rsquo;s talking about Russia these days. But how much do you actually know about Russia? How much of what you know is just left over from the old Cold War frame of thinking?
This coming Saturday at 6 pm, Fantagraphics Books, University of Washington, and Short Run are bringing Russian cartoonist/journalist Victoria Lomasko to the Fantagraphics Bookstore and Gallery in Georgetown. Lomasko will be presenting from and signing her new book of journalism, Other Russias.

        <div class="content">
          Since June of 2012, Nathan Vass has been blogging about his experiences as a driver for King County Metro. On his blog, The View from Nathan’s Bus, he writes candidly about what he sees as a driver on the 7 line through Rainier Valley, which is commonly stereotyped as the city’s most infamous route.
Operating a bus gives you a front row seat to the very best and worst of humanity.

          Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles good for slow consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat.
Three Iconic Musicians on Artistic Creation — and Its Importance Now Wyatt Mason&#8217;s humility lifts this interview with Kendrick Lamar, Beck, and Tom Waits beyond its style-magazine setting. Maybe because Mason asks &#8220;some stupid questions,&#8221; each of the three musicians responds directly and unpretentiously, offering up their take on songwriting and the relationship between music and the world in times of crisis.

Located in the Writer&rsquo;s Block, it&rsquo;s staffed by local librarians &mdash; thirty-five of them from twelve library systems! &mdash; who are there for reading recommendations, and also research advice for content creators. There&rsquo;s a chill area where you can get away from the bustle for a few minutes to check out what they have on their shelves.
And if you&rsquo;re creator, one of the organizers has put out a call for you to come by and be a volunteer for an hour or so.

 Are you a poet? Do you want to be Seattle&rsquo;s next Civic Poet? The position, as pioneered by our first Civic Poet Claudia Castro Luna, is about advocacy — about reading poetry at City Hall meetings and teaching classes about interpreting the city through poetry. She&rsquo;s done a stellar job and the next Civic Poet has a lot to live up to.
