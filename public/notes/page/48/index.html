          This is a public service announcement: between January 1st and March 31st, Hugo House has open submissions for two very different positions.
The first is the Poet-In-Residence position, which is a two-year title that offers a monthly stipend and paid teaching opportunities. You can read about the current Writers-in-Residence here and apply here.
The second is the Made at Hugo House program, which offers &ldquo;space and resources to four to six fellows in the Seattle area to complete a proposed project.

Wednesday January 11th: Cat Rambo and Margaret Chiavetta
Two Seattle-based fantasy authors debut new work at Seattle’s best sci-fi bookstore. If you’ve been involved in our sci-fi community, you likely know Rambo’s name. Her newest book, Neither Here Nor There, is a collection of fantasy stories. You can see a tiny version of the nifty flip-cover format of the book right above this calendar entry. Chiavetta’s Sir Duffy’s Promise is the first in a new middle-reader fantasy series University Book Store, 4326 University Way N.

          “Provocative” has become a dirty word. As Donald Trump lurches toward the presidency and white nationalist Milo Yiannopoulos scores a $250,000 book deal, provocation has become synonymous with trolling, and trolling has gone mainstream. When Seattle authors Lindy West and Sherman Alexie very visibly quit Twitter last week, they demonstrated an exhaustion with provocation. We’ve had it with devil’s advocates and thought experiments that are intended to do nothing but get a reaction out of us.

          I hope you&rsquo;ll keep a couple of events in mind as we approach President Trump&rsquo;s inauguration. At Town Hall on Sunday, January 15th, Washington writers celebrate Martin Luther King Jr&rsquo;s birthday and celebrate free speech with an event called &ldquo;Writers Resist.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll read their own work and the work of great Americans like Susan B. Anthony, Malcolm X, Susan Sontag, and Thomas Paine. Some of the authors reading include:

          Selene and Endymion
Snooze-button darling,
I’ve been up all night:
scrubbing the pans till they star-shine,
making the mirror a gleaming lake.
When I come to you
you don’t wake.
Atalanta and Hippomenes
I have a meat-eater’s heart,
and baby, you’re the whole buffet.
You’re ribs slick with smearing sauce,
midnight ice cream
too tempting not to eat &mdash;
you sugared cheat.
You thump between my teeth.

&mdash; Seattle Library (@SPLBuzz) January 7, 2017 It&rsquo;s nowhere near the most overdue book of all time — George Washington took out a book that was returned 221 years later — but it&rsquo;s still quite impressive.

          On Saturday, Heidi Groover at The Stranger reported that Seattle Times book section editor Mary Ann Gwinn was accepting a buyout and leaving the paper. Gwinn is one of nearly two dozen reporters who are being laid off or bought out.
There will be plenty of time to reflect on Gwinn&rsquo;s career in the weeks ahead; she confirmed that she&rsquo;ll sit for an interview with the Seattle Review of Books to discuss her nearly two decades as books editor at the Times.

And we&rsquo;re changing things up for Monday, too. For the last year and a half, we ran a Bookstore of the Month feature, in which we talked to booksellers, discussed bookstore histories, and talked about Seattle&rsquo;s strong bookstore culture.

In case you missed it [when it was announced in late December](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/12/20/and-the-next-seattle-reads-title-is/), the 2017 Seattle Reads book selection is *The Turner House*, by Angela Flournoy. The Seattle Reads program (which used to be known by the name "If All Seattle Read the Same Book...") delivers hundreds of copies of a chosen book to libraries all around Seattle every spring. In May of this year, Flournoy will do a number of events around Seattle, discussing *The Turner House* in a series of readings and community events.
