        <div class="content">
          For Duane Wilkins, University Book Store is a family affair. His mother worked there for over 20 years, and he started shopping there, by his own estimation, somewhere between the ages of 12 and 14. “I think sometimes I work here as karmic payback for what I put booksellers through” as a customer, Wilkins jokes. He used to bombard U Book Store employees with questions — “when is the next book in this series coming out and when is this book coming out in paperback” and so on.

        <div class="content">
          Stesha Brandon has long been one of the most passionate advocates for literary events in Seattle, first in her role as events coordinator at University Book Store and then as program director at Town Hall Seattle. [Today’s announcement that she is the new interim executive director](http://seattlecityoflit.org/blog/) of [Seattle’s City of Literature organization](http://seattlecityoflit.org/) is great news. Brandon brings to the job a steady hand, a proven commitment to the community, and a keen sense of what Seattle’s literary scene needs, as well as a much-needed critical eye and a sterling record of professionalism.

          Eva Jurczyk writes at The Awl:
...what if I, in my capacity as a book reviewer, have the power to shift the ratio of rubbish pirate books by dudes to meaningful literature by women? The publishing houses will keep putting out books about buccaneers and they’ll keep appearing on my monthly review list but what if I don’t expend any mental energy or spill a drop of ink about them? This wouldn’t change the number of books by women that are published every year, nor the total number of books that *Publisher’s Weekly* reviews—some eight thousand per year, mostly for librarians, the media, and booksellers—but if someone is reserving all of their mental energy and all of their ink for female-authored books, then perhaps these books will be covered sooner, the gems among them celebrated louder, and the publishing industry will slowly adjust the definition of the type of book that is deemed worthy of attention.

          Congratulations are due to Chris Higashi, the director of the Washington Center for the Book. Mary Ann Gwinn at the Seattle Times reports that Higashi is receiving this year&rsquo;s Sherry Prowda Literary Champion Award, which is a prize celebrating a person who champions the Seattle literary community. Higashi is a powerhouse who curates the library&rsquo;s reading series and many of the library&rsquo;s wonderful literacy programs. She is exactly the kind of person the library should be emulating; let&rsquo;s hope this award underlines that fact.

          MONDAY Elliott Bay Book Company kicks off your Week in Readings. Mo Daviau reads from her debut novel, which is titled Every Anxious Wave. Kirkus described it as a ”punk-rock-time-travel story for the ages.” It’s about a person who finds a time-warp in his closet, which he then leases out to people so they can go back in time and watch their favorite bands play.
TUESDAY Beloved Seattle young adult author Sean Beaudoin debuts his new short story collection, Welcome Thieves, in a release party at Hugo House.

          [The Secret Lives of Tumblr Teens](https://newrepublic.com/article/129002/secret-lives-tumblr-teens "The Secret Lives of Tumblr Teens | New Republic") The extraordinarily nutso piece by Elspeth Reeve that everybody was talking about this week.
 Each social media network creates a particular kind of teenage star: Those blessed with early-onset hotness are drawn to YouTube, the fashionable and seemingly wealthy post to Instagram, the most charismatic actors, dancers, and comedians thrive on Vine. On Facebook, every link you share and photo you post is a statement of your identity.
