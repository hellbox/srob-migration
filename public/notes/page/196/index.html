          We love Greenwood&rsquo;s literary tutoring center The Bureau of Fearless Ideas (formerly known as 826 Seattle) and we are big fans of this Facebook post demonstrating a recent student experiment in creating illuminated manuscripts. It seems as though, with the general-interest acceptance of comic books, we&rsquo;re about due for an illuminated manuscript resurgence. Maybe one of these kids will lead the charge.

MONDAY Third Place Books hosts novelist Paula McLain tonight. McLain writes historical fiction, and is the author of the popular novels Circling the Sun (First sentence: “The Vega Gull is peacock blue with silver wings, more splendid than any bird I’ve known, and somehow mine to fly.”) and The Paris Wife (First sentence: “Though I often looked for one, I finally had to admit that there could be no cure for Paris.

          Our thanks to this week&rsquo;s sponsor Darin Bradley. One reviewer said this about his novel Chimpanzee “So if you took Twelve Monkeys, add The Time Traveler’s Wife but subtract the time-travel, multiply by 1984, factor in Strange Days and divide by Fight Club, you get Chimpanzee.”
The Seattle Review of Books relies on sponorships to bring you poems, interviews, reviews, notes, and advice every week. Go read a chapter from Chimpanzee, and if you like it, consider picking up a copy and telling him you heard about it hear.

          [How to spot whodunnit: academics crack Agatha Christie's code](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/02/academics-unlock-formula-agatha-christies-mysteries) At the bequest of television channel, a group of academics looked at Agatha Christie&rsquo;s work, and developed formulas to reveal the patterns within.
 Many of the results concerned the gender of the killer. For example, they found that if the victim was strangled, the killer was more likely to be male (or male with a female accomplice), whereas if the setting was a country house – not uncommon for a Christie novel – there was a 75% chance the killer would be female.

        <div class="content">
          Our sincerest thanks to Janine A. Southard for sponsoring The Seattle Review of Books this week. Sponsorships are very important to us. Why? Because internet advertising is horrible and we&rsquo;re trying to do something about it.
So, instead, we offer a full chapter from Southard&rsquo;s hilarious, and well-loved Cracked! A Magic iPhone Story (four stars on Amazon!) book. The award-winning Southard (a Seattle denizen) shows you how the geeks of Seattle live, provides a running and often-hilarious social commentary on today’s world, and reminds you that, so long as you have friends, you are never alone.

          Last month, I wrote about why I&rsquo;m not reading Go Set a Watchman. (Short version: &ldquo;I’d just rather not have to write a negative review of a Harper Lee book.&rdquo;) If you want to read the book, that&rsquo;s your prerogative, of course. And if you want to slag the book without reading it, that&rsquo;s your right as an American, too. But I can&rsquo;t help but feel that this news falls less on the side of a natural response to Go Set a Watchman and more on the side of a publicity stunt:

**Dear Cienna,**
** I recently read an article proving that publishers are more interested in novels submitted under male names. My novel has been rejected by several agents for being too “weird and creepy,” and I can’t help but wonder if they’d have the same criticism if the same book had a male name on it.
