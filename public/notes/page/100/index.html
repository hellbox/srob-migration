          **Wednesday June 22: *Grace* Reading**
If you’re going to attend one reading by a debut novelist this year, skip the horse-chokingly thick tour-de-force by the white-boy wunderkind from Brooklyn and attend this one instead. Narrated by a ghost—“I am dead” is the first line—Natashia Deón’s riveting *Grace* tells the story of black women in America’s slave trade. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.

          Sometimes all the good things happen in a single night. These are the nights where you want to throw yourself into a large sterile glass tube, flip a mad-scientist switch, and then send a clone or two staggering off into the night, just so you’re sure you don’t miss a thing. Thursday, June 23rd is one of those nights.
The poetry collective Margin Shift has for years been presenting some of the liveliest, most diverse readings in town.

          After [looking into why poems go viral](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/06/21/a-poet-explores-when-poems-go-viral/), Kelli Russell Agodon was not done. She wanted to talk to the people involved, too. Here's her interview with poet [Maggie Smith](https://twitter.com/maggiesmithpoet), and _Waxwing Magazine_ editors [Justin Bigos](https://twitter.com/JustinBigos), Erin Stalcup, and [W. Todd Kaneko](https://twitter.com/ToddKaneko).
The Poet of “Good Bones,” Maggie Smith **Kelli Russell Agodon: Can you trace back to the first person(s) who shared it or when it took off for you? Can you figure out (besides Waxwing) where/how it began to spread?

        <div class="content">
          When was the last time you remember a poem going viral? This week, despite ongoing reports of “poetry being dead” for the last fifteen years, Maggie Smith’s poem “Good Bones” has been shared generously and thousands of times over on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Tumblr, as well as the story being picked up in the Guardian, Slate, The Daily Dot, and The Oregonian.
I decided to follow path backwards to figure out how this poem ended up being passed on throughout the world.

          Once upon a time a man took me to dinner, asked
if I’d been abused as a child, like that would explain it.
Sure. I keep a cabinet of curiosities &mdash;
but that was never one of them. See the dust?
Things we’re too old for slip off shelves,
line up to watch. In direct sunlight they’re small,
made of ash, disintegrating like abrupt love.
To recall a memory weakens it,

        <div class="content">
          The eBook Reader blog wonders:
Kindle ereaders are one of the few reading devices on the planet that don’t support ePub format.
Kindles are the most popular dedicated readers and ePub is the most common ebook format, so what gives?
Why doesn’t Amazon add support for ePub ebooks to Kindles?
 I guess this could be a rhetorical question, but the answer is ridiculously obvious: because Amazon doesn&rsquo;t want to open its system up or allow people to read e-books that they&rsquo;ve bought in other places.

          Sponsor Entre Rios books is back. Did you know it&rsquo;s been two hundred years, this week, since Mary Shelley, Lord Byron, Claire Clairmont, and Percy Bysshe Shelley met at Lake Geneva, and spun the stories that would turn into Dracula and Frankenstein?
But it wasn&rsquo;t only horror and science fiction that came that fateful time together. Byron inspired Shelley, and pushed him to reach greater heights with his poetry. One avenue, unknown for many years, was Shelley&rsquo;s political work, which Entre Rios has collected (in Shelley&rsquo;s preferred order) in a small handsome volume.

          “By autobiography, we meant daydreams, nightdreams, the act of writing, the relationship to the reader, the meeting of flesh and culture; the self as collaboration, the self as disintegration, the gaps, inconsistencies, and distortions of the self; the enjambments of power, family, history, and language.” 
![](/webhook-uploads/1466392624231/communalnude.jpg)
In *Communal Nude: Collected Essays*, this is one of the ways Robert Glück introduces New Narrative, a term he coined with Bruce Boone and Steve Abbott in the late 1970s to describe a form of prose writing emerging in the San Francisco Bay Area as a response to Language poetry and its formalist obsession with breaking apart (and breaking down) voice and context to interrogate the ways that words generate meaning.

          Last week, Third Place Books Seward Park manager Eric McDaniel said he liked having a mix of experienced booksellers and relative novices on staff. At least one of those new booksellers, though, isn’t new to the world of books: though Seward Park is the only bookstore where she’s worked, Naomi possesses an impressive resume including stints as a manager of the circulation desk at Yale libraries, and as a humanities professor.
