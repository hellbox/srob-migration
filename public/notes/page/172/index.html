          Yesterday, Slate published this amazing interactive annotated edition of Bartleby, the Scrivener. I&rsquo;m not a fan of all of Melville&rsquo;s writing, but Bartleby becomes more relevant with each passing year. It&rsquo;s a powerful American myth, and when viewed from another angle it can be read as kind of a forerunner to Office Space and The Office and other comedies about the drudgery of middle management.

If you began your Lit Crawl last night at the reading sponsored by Seattle-based literary magazine The James Franco Review, the first thing you heard was a poem by Lena Khalaf Tuffaha that includes this line: “Here, our senses are overwhelmed.” That’s about the most appropriate invocation the evening could’ve asked for.
Lit Crawl is an event that is by definition overwhelming. You’re given way too many options to choose from— almost a hundred readers, spread all over Capitol and First Hill — and audiences spend the night chasing readings around town.

G. Willow Wilson, and Margaret Stohl, will discuss their work and have a book signing Saturday at University Book Store in Bellevue &mdash; a rare opportunity to hear two women talk about the amazing work they&rsquo;ve been doing with female superheroes.

          Maybe I was just in a bad mood or something, but I didn&rsquo;t find much enjoyment in the comics I bought yesterday. The new issue of Godzilla in Hell is a total bust — a real downer of a serious, clunky monster comic after last issue’s greatness. The 28th issue of Astro City continues a depressing trend with that series; what began as commentary on superheroes has basically become a boring superhero anthology comic.

          The Seattle edition of Lit Crawl is finally here! It starts at 6 pm and continues through 8:45 (although the afterparty at Fred Wildlife Refuge will likely continue until the booze runs dry.) You can find a map and schedule here.
If you need help choosing what to do tonight, here are all eight of the itineraries we&rsquo;ve proposed here at the Seattle Review of Books over the last week-and-a-half:

          On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our final suggested itinerary:
Today we&rsquo;re focusing on some Lit Crawl events featuring excellent local writers you really ought to know by now.

        <div class="content">
          Over 14,000 people recently took a Seattle Public Library survey about a &ldquo;branding initiative&rdquo; that would change the face of the library and cost well over a million dollars, according to SPL Communications Director Andra Addison. Advised by heavy-hitter Hornall Anderson, City Librarian Marcellus Turner is spearheading a campaign to rename the library and replace its familiar logo, all in an effort to more clearly project the image described in this &ldquo;brand statement&rdquo;:

          Our October Bookstore of the Month is a special one, because it’s a bookstore that will only exist in the world for one day. [The Short Run Comix & Arts Festival](http://www.shortrun.org/) will take place this year on October 31st at Fisher Pavilion in the Seattle Center, and for that one day, it will be the largest bookseller of independent literature, zines, and comics in the Seattle area. Every week this month, we’ll highlight a different Short Run exhibitor, to give you a better idea of the scope and breadth of the festival.
