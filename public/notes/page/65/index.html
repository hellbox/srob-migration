        <div class="content">
          Tonight, as part of First Thursday Art Walk, the Brainfreeze art gallery — where the Lusty Lady used to be, across from the Seattle Art Museum on 1st Avenue, downtown — is hosting a launch party for a brand-new free publication that’s trying to fill the gap left by the sadly defunct Intruder anthology comic. The debut issue of the new free quarterly comic Thick as Thieves looks almost exactly like an issue of Intruder, save for the fact that it’s only 8 pages rather than 16.

Yesterday was comics artist Steve Ditko’s 89th birthday, which made it an especially fitting day to watch a preview screening of Doctor Strange. Ditko was the co-creator of the Doctor Strange character, and those early comics, published in Strange Tales in the mid-1960s, were probably the purest example of Ditko’s imagination ever put to paper. Strange frequently ventured to realms where giant creatures made of spikes would crawl out of pools of liquid floating in thin air, or where thick bands of ink formed protective barriers that would keep astral forms — essentially, the souls of humans — trapped away from their bodies.

        <div class="content">
          Seattle-area writer Ted Chiang has long been one of the local sci-fi community&rsquo;s best-kept secrets. Just about every Seattle sci-fi writer worth their salt counts Chiang as one of their favorite writers, but his work has not garnered larger acclaim. That&rsquo;s all about to change: one of Chiang&rsquo;s short stories is about to be adapted into an upcoming film called Arrival starring Amy Adams that is attracting a lot of pre-release buzz.

          Wednesday November 2: Short Run International Comix Night
In just a few years, Seattle’s own Short Run Comix &amp; Arts Festival has gone from a zine show packed into the Vera Project to an international affair. Tonight, Short Run brings four worldly cartoonists — from Lebanon, Greece, Belgium, Mexico, and Croatia — to the downtown library to discuss the universal language of comics.

          It’s an overwhelming year. We’re all overwhelmed by the presidential election, we’ve been overwhelmed by the continual cycle of cool celebrities dying and the swarm of overwrought tributes to said deceased cool celebrities that flood our social media feeds, and Seattle’s incredible growth — and attendant anxieties — has been impossibly overwhelming all year long. In fact, everything has been overwhelming for so long that we’ve forgotten what it is to feel whelmed.

          On November 5th and 6th, Third Place Books is having their semi-annual used book sale. Every used book at all three Third Place locations will be 40 percent off. And they&rsquo;re trying something new this time around: if you visit and spend at least $5 at each location, you&rsquo;ll get a $10 gift card. It&rsquo;s going to be a long winter, and this is a great way to stock up your nightstand.

          On Mars, water once flowed. Where

suspect a cosmic cue ball &mdash; a comet

the planet escaped
its own atmosphere, just
left it there, jumped its own skin
like an anime cat
leaving his pajamas spread-eagle
in space. And now, goddammit,
David Bowie is dead.
I worshipped him like a flower
twists its dewy face to the brightest,

Hayes, a native Alaskan living in Juneau, wrote about returning to Alaska in her first book, Blonde Indian. This book, part memoir, part cultural exploration, tunrs Hayes&rsquo; unique voice to other stories, like completing college in her fifties and becoming a professor and writer.
