Dear Cienna,
**I recently moved from Seattle to a small town in the Midwest, giving up the Seattle Public Library’s massive collection for something much more modest. Now, our library system here is pretty good!

          As Jennifer Schuessler reported in the New York Times, the MacArthur Foundation announced their annual &ldquo;Genius&rdquo; grant winners yesterday. I&rsquo;m very excited to see that the new list of &ldquo;Geniuses&rdquo; includes authors we&rsquo;ve written about here at the Seattle Review of Books over the past year.
 Willie Fitzgerald wrote a review incorporating Claudia Rankine&rsquo;s compelling poetry collection Citizen last year.
 The brilliant Maggie Nelson has been written about a few times here on the site, most notably in Cate McGehee&rsquo;s splendid review of The Argonauts and Jennifer Bernstein&rsquo;s review of, among other books, Nelson&rsquo;s The Art of Cruelty.

I’m delighted to be kicking off this column for the Seattle Review of Books during a month full of crime-fiction action. Bloody Scotland, Scotland’s International Crime Writing Festival, toasted its fourth year, crowning Christopher Brookmyre with the top McIlvanney Prize, and featuring the traditional England crime writers vs. Scottish crime writers football match (England won, 7-1).

          Sometimes you just fall in love with an artist’s work at first sight. That was what it was like for me reading the first issue of DC’s new Doom Patrol, which was published last week. I don’t know where Nick Derington comes from, but that two-page spread he drew that opens the issue, with a long, narrow panel of protagonist Casey Brinke driving an ambulance, is this kind of a moment for me.

        <div class="content">
          Amor Towles’s second novel, A Gentleman in Moscow, centers around Count Alexander Rostov, a wealthy member of the aristocracy who, in the early 1920s, finds himself on the wrong side of the Russian Revolution. For the crime of his wealth and upper-class roots, the Count is sentenced to live under house arrest in a cramped room tucked into the top of a grand Moscow hotel called the Metropol. And there he stays, for three decades.

          Flavorwire reports on a Publishers Weekly report on the publishing industry. The bottom line: &ldquo;Publishing Makes &lsquo;Little Progress&rsquo; in Diversity, Remains Extremely White.&rdquo; This is not good enough.
 And there&rsquo;s more bad news in the PW report, including the fact that women in publishing are still paid less than men. Boo.
 This came in too late for me to add to the readings calendar this week, but you should be advised that the Words West reading series will take place tomorrow night at C&amp;P Coffee Company in West Seattle.
