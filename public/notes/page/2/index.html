          My friend on the couch trembles.
She’s crying because someone in her family
has died/is dying/is dead. She has stopped
speaking in future tense and only says, Now.
The clock speaks in abstract sentences
and she says, We need more wine.
A corner of her life is being rebuilt
by a construction company she hasn’t approved.
A corner and her driveway is being paved.
With gravestones. When she cries, I pour her

          Mara Siegler at Page Six writes that professional troll and amateur hate-monger Milo Yiannopoulos is suing Simon &amp; Schuster for ten million dollars. The publisher canceled Yiannopoulos&rsquo;s book after some of his pro-pedophilia comments came to light. Siegler writes:
In the suit filed with the New York County clerk, Yiannopoulos claims the publisher caused “irreparable harm” to him and “the commercial value of his public persona, including millions of dollars in royalties and fees, as well as permanent harm to the development and exploitation of his stature as an important, sought after media figure and free speech personality.

We&rsquo;re thrilled to welcome this week&rsquo;s sponsor, Nicole Dieker, back to the site. Nicole is a Seattle stalwart and a vibrant voice at The Billfold, Lifehacker, the Write Life, and Spark Notes, among others. In fact, we&rsquo;ve recently featured an essay by Nicole from The Awl in our Sunday Post.
Just a few months after publication, her debut novel — The Biographies of Ordinary People, Vol. 1 — already has loyal readers waiting eagerly for Vol.

          Faithful readers of the site have [seen Dawn McCarra Bass's byline](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/dawn-mccarra-bass/) for almost a year now. But what readers may not know is that in the last few months, her role at the site has expanded: she's now an associate editor, and she's accepting and editing freelance pieces for the site. I talked with Dawn about what kind of pitches she's looking for, why she's interested in working with the *Seattle Review of Books*, and what she likes to see in reviews.

‘Love Thy Neighbor?’ Dawson, MN, welcomed Dr. Ayaz Virji — its first Muslim resident — with open arms when he and his family arrived three years ago. Then his town joined the majority in Minnesota that voted to put Donald Trump into office.

Dear Cienna,
It’s obvious that my local bookstore is going out of business. I don’t know how long they have left on this planet, but the shelves are thinning and the staff is shrinking and everything feels a little more desperate.

 You probably know that Fantagraphics cartoonist Matt Furie&rsquo;s cartoon character Pepe the Frog has become a symbol of the Trump-loving alt-right. Furie is by all accounts a wonderful, easygoing guy who was completely blindsided by the fact that his laid-back cartoon frog has become the rough equivalent of a swastika.

**Sunday July 9th: *Nature Poem* Reading**
Tommy Pico is a prominent Brooklyn poet, podcaster, and an editor at the terrific site Literary Hub. He’s in town with his second poetry collection, a book-length poem called *Nature Poem*. To help Pico celebrate his new arrival, Seattle poet Sarah Galvin — one of the very best readers in the city — will join him onstage and read a few poems.
