          [Pond Scum: Henry David Thoreau’s moral myopia.](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum "Why Do We Love Henry David Thoreau? - The New Yorker") Oh, how I love Kathryn Schulz&rsquo;s takedown of Thoreau in the latest New Yorker! I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of Henry David, and we see his offspring littering the Pacific Northwest hiking trails, beaches, and REIs &mdash; especially on sale days. This was a delicious read for me.
The real Thoreau was, in the fullest sense of the word, self-obsessed: narcissistic, fanatical about self-control, adamant that he required nothing beyond himself to understand and thrive in the world.

Podcast #2 I talked with Brad Craft and Nick DiMartino for the 50th episode of their delightful Breakfast at the Bookstore podcast. We discussed the importance of criticism, what we&rsquo;ve been reading lately, and why Martin McClellan and I started the Seattle Review of Books.
