        <div class="content">
          Every October 20th a coalition of partners like the New York Times, the National Writing Project, the National Council of Teachers of English, and the Teaching Channel come together to encourage writing. They want you to hashtag: #WhyIWrite.
I even did one of my own:
#WhyIWrite Because figuring out how I feel about something requires five or so years and 80,000 or so words.
&mdash; Martin McClellan (@hellbox) October 20, 2015 The whole thing was inspired by Orwell’s famous essay, whose title inspired the hashtag.

        <div class="content">
          On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our seventh suggested itinerary:
All of the readings on this itinerary feature true, honest-to-God, not-made-up stories.
1. At Town Hall to start out the night, memoirists Sarah Hepola (Blackout) and Melissa Febos (Whip Smart) will read from their stories of sobriety and recovery.

          This is welcome news: &ldquo;New York Review Books is pleased to announce New York Review Comics, a new series of books at the union of art and literature.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re going to present work that has never been translated into English, as well as revivals of work by cartoonists Mark Beyer and Glen Baxter. Always good to see literary comics get some love; Fantagraphics can&rsquo;t do all this work by themselves.

Shin Yu Pai is one of the smartest, most intellectually curious poets in the region. Her projects are always ambitious, and they string together multiple perspectives and interests — history, media, art, site-specificity — to create something new. So the news that she’s been [named the Redmond Poet Laureate](http://www.redmond.gov/cms/one.aspx?objectId=6983) is especially exciting. Pai’s poetry has incorporated family history and photography and even botany to tell a new kind of story through poetry; she’s exactly the kind of poet you want to represent a city, because she is capable of thinking about all the different levels of what it means to be a city.

          As we have noted repeatedly, this Thursday is Lit Crawl Seattle. But it&rsquo;s also important to note that Alison Bechdel will be reading at Town Hall in a sold-out edition of the 2015-2016 Seattle Arts and Lectures reading series. If you haven&rsquo;t yet read Bechdel&rsquo;s Fun Home or Dykes to Watch Out For, this excellent essay by Seattle writer Corinne Manning at Literary Hub explains her particular genius.

          I’ve worn them once
my wedding shoes
dyed red, more and yes red
the way a strike against
the tip of a match ignites
and pomegranate rubies
stain a thousand secrets worth
Adam did not fall for jewels
but for the juice of a fruit
like the crimson Fujis I harvest
each fall from my backyard tree
when rusty leaves layer the ground

          We love titles that tell you what you&rsquo;re in for (look at ours!). This week&rsquo;s sponsor G.G. Silverman hit the nail on the head with her book Vegan Teenage Zombie Huntress. The first two chapters , which we published on our sponsorships page, left us wanting more — and we think you&rsquo;ll love them too. Give it a read.
We are sponsored by independent writers and publishers who, with us, want to make internet advertising 100 percent less terrible.

For as long as Seattle has been a city, people have come to town and people have left town. Earlier this year, the *Seattle Review of Books* introduced a feature called [Exit Interview](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/exit-interview-talking-with-kate-lebo-about-why-she-left-seattle-for-spokane/), in which we talk with [an author who recently left town](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/09/exit-interview-kelly-davio-is-moving-to-london/) about their Seattle experience. The natural pair to that feature is New Hire, an interview with an author who’s just arrived here. (If you have any suggestions for a subject of an upcoming Exit Interview or a New Hire, please [drop us a line](http://seattlereviewofbooks.

          MONDAY Start the week off with some librarians at a Bookish Happy Hour at the Diller Room. This is part of Seattle Public Library’s Booktoberfest program, which brings librarians, beer, and you together in non-traditional venues.
TUESDAY I’ve been looking forward to this for months now: at the Seattle Public Library, I’m participating in an event with Colum McCann and John Freeman. McCann, of course, is a beloved novelist who manages to span that widest of chasms: he writes — gasp!
