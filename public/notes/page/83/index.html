          I would just like to second Kelly Conaboy&rsquo;s post on the Hairpin titled &ldquo;Blog, You Idiots.&rdquo; Not so long ago, blogging felt like a new and exciting form of communication: there was aggregation, yes, but there was also fresh short writing on a regular basis. And now blogging seems to be disappearing, and that&rsquo;s very sad because it seems as though we&rsquo;ve only just started to figure out the capabilities of blogging as an art form.

          If you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to own the remains of a famous writer&rsquo;s body, this is your best shot.
The famed author's cremains — which are stored in a Japanese wooden box and dated from August 28, 1984 — have been put on sale at the Los Angeles–based auction house Julien's Auctions. "I am sure people are going to think this is disrespectful," Julien's Auctions chief executive Darren Julien told Vanity Fair.

        <div class="content">
          The Nevertold Casket Co. looks kind of like the cursed junk shop from Gremlins—a store that proudly carries “haunted” merchandise which could add a conversation piece to your living room or rain down eternal torment on your household in the form of a vicious spirit of vengeance from feudal Japan. It is a shop, in other words, that is full of stories. The wax dummy of a baby covered in syphilis sores has to have an explanation behind it, right?

        <div class="content">
          Electric Literature cites a new study which &ldquo;found that readers of literary fiction — but not commercial fiction — have a better understanding of other people’s emotions.&rdquo;
Yeah, unless there&rsquo;s a scientific method to determine the difference between commercial fiction and literary fiction, this sounds like bunk to me — the kind of easy study which enforces preconceived notions about art and commerce. But if there&rsquo;s one damn thing the internet loves, it&rsquo;s using scientific studies to enforce their own preconceived notions.

          We told you back at the beginning of the month that Greenlake kids&rsquo; store Mockingbird Books would be closing on August 27th. That means you have less than week to pay your respects and pick up some childrens&rsquo; books on discount. KOMO ran a video about Mockingbird&rsquo;s last days.

          My diaphragm left behind
A mind works funny when it comes to sex
important things crash
A fire wound takes everything away
Random acts of nature relentless
Internalized violence a fog
I killed the frog for science
What we love we destroy
Yesterday I was a sex machine
My warrior searching a way to spark
Internet recessions scare me
I wanted to sleep with him
but my diaphragm was lost
