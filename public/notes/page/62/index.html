In the shadow of this disastrous election, it’s almost impossible to think about Christmas. But whether you’re ready or not, the holidays are coming, and there are lots of people you love out there in the world who deserve a little happiness in their lives. Books are the best gift: they’re deeply personal, they help us empathize with each other, and they’re so much more meaningful than, say, a juicer.

          In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, it should be obvious to everyone that the Urban Archipelago concept promoted by thinkers like Richard Florida — the idea of cities as strongholds of liberal progress — was a dead end. As liberals spent twelve years building cities into citadels of progressivism and waiting for national demographics to shift our way, we allowed the Rust Belt to erode and we fostered an us-versus-them relationship with rural America.

          Yesterday, Fantagraphics Books announced that they&rsquo;re entering into a partnership with young British comics publisher Breakdown Press. The Seattle-based publisher is bringing some (not all) of the very best of Breakdown&rsquo;s output to American bookstores and comics shops, starting with Anna Haifisch&rsquo;s book The Artist and Hayashi Seiichi&rsquo;s book Red Red Rocks and Other Stories 1967-1970. Breakdown&rsquo;s catalog looks very cool — a mix of international artists working in a variety of styles.

        <div class="content">
          A Filipino restaurant is bone marrow
and vinegar boiling
perfectly over the sound
of the most dramatic Tagalog
soap opera you’ve ever been forced to watch.
I come here, when I can afford it,
when my homesick can only be cured
by my mother’s hands
The server is a young woman,
possibly in her 20’s with a posture
that’s been carrying the weight of her father’s expectations.
She calls me, “Ate” every time I come in.

          Sponsor Sandra Vea has brought her amazing biography of her friend, Masao, a Japanese-American solider in World War II, who fought some of the hardest battles in the hardest war, all while being under suspicion from his fellow soldiers.
We have a full chapter on our sponsor&rsquo;s page for you to read, and mark the dates November 19th, and February 25th, when Sandra will be appearing to talk more about the book in person.

          Step 1: Visit, send an email to, or call your local independent neighborhood bookstore. Talk to the store owner. Ask how they feel about the prospect of a President Trump.
Step 2: Consider this tweet, from the owner of the world&rsquo;s largest bookstore:
Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump. I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.
&mdash; Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 Step 3: Ask yourself, which reaction best reflects your values?

Our November Bookstore of the Month, Elliott Bay Book Company, is a store that prides itself on its history and its strong sense of continuity. But not everyone at Elliott Bay has worked there for decades. New booksellers start at the store all the time, and they make their mark pretty quickly. Mary Thompson started at Elliott Bay in mid-June. It’s her first bookstore job, though not her first literary job — she worked at the Hugo House doing front desk and events assistance before getting into bookselling.

          A Time for Refusal Well, I was going to go election-free today. I thought: &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to read around the thing, to not have to face it every moment. Why can&rsquo;t we have a Sunday morning without the election?&rdquo;
I still think that&rsquo;s a fine goal, but to be honest, the best things published this week are about the election. Everybody is thinking about the election. Everybody is writing about the election.
