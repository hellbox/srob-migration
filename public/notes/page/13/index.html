          Nobody’s ever accused Paul Mullin of being soft. Back when Mullin was a playwright, he wrote stories about genius brains being turned to slurry from aggressive radiation poisoning and monstrous men who recall their own horrific acts even through the blessed fog of amnesia. Mullin wrote long screeds about what was wrong with American theater (spoiler alert: basically, everything), and he wasn’t afraid to make enemies. Then, about four years ago, he retired from theater.

          Writing theater criticism always made me slightly uncomfortable; specifically, I hated to write negative reviews. I have no trouble writing negative reviews of books, but there&rsquo;s something about the vulnerability and teamwork of a play — a group of people coming together for little to no money in order to strut across a stage and mimic emotional states — that I hate to criticize.
There&rsquo;s not really a logical framework behind any of this.

          Does your organization need diversity training? If you&rsquo;re an arts organization in Seattle, the answer is probably yes. This Saturday in the 2100 Building at 1:30 p.m., two local artists with lots of experience in the topic are hosting a &ldquo;public discussion about the pros and cons of working with professionals, consultants, and hands-on-experts to facilitate an anti-racist work environment.&rdquo; Entry fees range from $5 to $20, though nobody will be turned away for lack of funds.

          A cart carrying a metric ton of apples leaves the city at four meters per second. Another cart leaves the city carrying a boy, in love with an idea. Consider the swirl of laughter and personal tragedy at 6 meters per second. Say the idea does not love him back. Say he will lose his life in a maze of regrets. What can be said about the dust caked on the wheel spokes and the precarious sway of the chasse crossing over ruts and the staggered pavers knuckled together side by side.

Sponsor Anne Mendel delivered us a full chapter from her comically twisted dark novel _Etiquette for an Apocalypse_. Set in Portland in 2020, Mendel gives us a future when humanity is falling apart. But is that any reason to set aside manners?
Read the first full chapter on our sponsor&rsquo;s page &mdash; we think you&rsquo;ll really enjoy it. Visit Portland in the near future, and learn all about survival in a high-rise condo during the apocalypse.

On Saturday, SIFF presented the West Coast premiere of Bad Black, an action movie from the Ugandan micro-movie studio of Wakaliwood. An American producer named Alan Hofmanis was in attendance to present the film and lead a Skype Q&amp;A with director Nabwana I.G.G.
From a storytelling perspective, Wakaliwood films are unique in all the world. Hofmanis explained the history stretches back some three decades, when VHS tapes of American action films started circulating around the poorest parts of Uganda.

          I've known [Ksenia Anske](https://www.kseniaanske.com "Ksenia Anske") for almost twenty years. We were both students at Cornish College of the Arts, studying design, at the close of the Twentieth Century. A Russian who came to design school after studying architecture in her home country, her approach to design was always engaged, probing, and driven.
We'd occasionally stay in touch, but I hadn't talked to her in years when I heard she was one of the first round of writers (along with Seattle writer Scott Berkun) to be [awarded the Amtrak Residency](http://blog.
