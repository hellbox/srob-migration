          I use a trick to teach students
how to avoid passive voice.
Circle the verbs.
Imagine inserting “by zombies”
after each one.
Have the words been claimed
by the flesh-hungry undead?
If so, passive voice.
I wonder if these
sixth graders will recollect,
on summer vacation,
as they stretch their legs
on the way home
from Yellowstone or Yosemite
and the byway’s historical marker
beckons them to the
site of an Indian village &mdash;

          Just last week, we told you that booksellers around Seattle were buzzing about Colson Whitehead&rsquo;s upcoming novel Underground Railroad. We quoted Vlad from Third Place Books, who praised &ldquo;Whitehead’s unflinching exploration of the various manifestations of the economics of slavery.&rdquo;
Today, Oprah added her approval to the chorus of booksellers and librarians by adding the novel to her Oprah&rsquo;s Book Club label. &ldquo;The September issue of O, The Oprah Magazine (available Aug.

          Discovering new writers can be really hard. It&rsquo;s the reason we started our sponsorship program, and J.A. Wright is exactly the kind of writer we built it for. She&rsquo;s bringing her superbly wrought debut novel How To Grow an Addict to our site this week.
On our sponsor&rsquo;s page we have the prologue and first chapter, so you can read enough to discover that this is indeed a book you want to invest in.

          Slate&rsquo;s Isaac Chotiner asks Jonathan Franzen if he&rsquo;s ever considered writing a book about race:
I have thought about it, but—this is an embarrassing confession—I don’t have very many black friends. I have never been in love with a black woman. I feel like if I had, I might dare. Is there a word for when self-parody becomes the self? Is Jonathan Franzen the Donald Trump of the literary world?

        <div class="content">
          Founded in Green Lake by children’s book author Nancy White Carlstrom in 1977 — she’s best-known for the Jesse Bear series — Secret Garden Books moved to 15th Ave NW in Ballard before eventually settling in to its current location on Market Street. Secret Garden has always been known first and foremost as a children’s bookstore, but when New York bookseller Susan Scott moved to town after over a decade at fabled NYC store Books &amp; Co, she took over the buying and brought in what staffers delightfully refer to as “grownup books.

          Children&rsquo;s bookseller Mockingbird Books just announced that after eight years of selling books to the Green Lake neighborhood, they&rsquo;ll be closing at the end of this month. They cited a very simple reason: &ldquo;the gross sales for at least this retail store no longer cover the overhead to allow continued operation.&rdquo; They continue:
 Our last day of operations will be Saturday, August 27 and we have a celebration planned, so please join us.

          The subtle art of translating foreign fiction This collection of interviews by Rachel Cooke provides an interesting insight to translators’ thoughts, writing processes, and how they became translators. Some think of translation as its own art, while others adhere to the original text as best they can.
 There is no such thing as a literal translation – languages are entirely different systems and you can’t impose Spanish on English or vice versa.

As I said, political conventions are stories. They are narratives through which political parties explain America to America.Last week’s Republican National Convention was a straight-up horror story, a nightmare scenario in which America was under continuous and merciless attack from alien forces both without and within. Donald Trump painted himself as the one man standing between life as we know it and total destruction. it was a child’s morality tale, a binary-minded nightmare lullaby of “winners” and “losers,” of “good guys” and “bad guys,” of “America” and “real America.
