        <div class="content">
          Cartoonist J.R. Williams is reporting on Facebook that Northwestern autobiographical comics writer Dennis Eichhorn has passed away:
Aw, crap. Denny's gone. His wife Jane called to tell me that he passed away this morning. She suggested I put out the word. He was a great friend, and I'm sure gonna miss him. Williams and Eichhorn were frequent collaborators, perhaps most notably on The Legend of Wild Man Fischer.
Eichhorn&rsquo;s Real Stuff comics are wonderful examples of autobiographical comics, true examples of how good the collaboration between writer and artist can be.

          This Saturday, I&rsquo;ll be moderating a panel at the Frye Art Museum with poet John Olson, Fantagraphics publisher Gary Groth, and novelist Matt Briggs. They&rsquo;ll each read and then we&rsquo;ll discuss &ldquo;the boundaries and limits of genre&rdquo; as part of the Frye&rsquo;s ongoing Literary Festival, which is part of the Genius / 21 Century / Seattle exhibit. It&rsquo;s at 2 pm, it&rsquo;s free, and the Frye would be thrilled if you pre-registered for the event on their site.

          I couldn&rsquo;t make it to the comic book store last night because I was too busy celebrating at the launch party for California Four O&rsquo;Clock, the debut novel from Seattle Review of Books co-founder Martin McClellan. It was a big new comics Wednesday to miss; a ton of Marvel Comics relaunched yesterday with all-new first issues and status quos, including Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Doctor Strange. Of those three, the only one that I&rsquo;m at all interested in is Doctor Strange; writer Jason Aaron is often pretty good, and artist Chris Bachalo&rsquo;s noodly illustrations seem perfect for the baroqueness of the character as created by Steve Ditko.

        <div class="content">
          For as long as I’ve been covering Amazon’s growth, rumors have circulated about the online retailer opening a brick-and-mortar store that serves as a kind of showroom. But I’ve never seen a report as well-researched and as compelling as this Shelf Awareness story suggesting that Amazon is in the process of opening a bookstore in University Village, where Blue C Sushi used to be. And this rumor suggests that it’s specifically a bookstore, and not just a place to buy Amazon’s tablets and hardware, as all the previous rumors have indicated.

        <div class="content">
          Dear Editor:
Donna Miscolta raises a valid point in her review/essay, &ldquo;Reflections by and about white people.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure what the phrase &ldquo;comprehensive snapshot&rdquo; means, as used in a short review that appeared in Seattle Met, but its application to the anthology, Seattle: City of Literature set Donna off about the lack of ethnic diversity in the book.
Initially, I was willing to go along with her criticism. If you look at the table of contents, only six people of color contributed.

Last night was not an official _Seattle Review of Books_ party, it was the launch party for my book [_California Four O'Clock_](http://californiafouroclock.com). But since Paul and I were both there, and we talked about the site, and since some of you were there too and came up to say hello and introduce yourselves, I just wanted to say thank you. We had a grand time.

        <div class="content">
          The Nobel was granted to Alexievitch &ldquo;for her polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time.&rdquo; Remarkably, she is the very first journalist to ever win the Nobel in Literature. The BBC explains,
Her best-known works in English translation include *Voices From Chernobyl*, an oral history of the 1986 nuclear catastrophe; and *Boys In Zinc*, a collection of first-hand accounts from the Soviet-Afghan war. The title refers to the zinc coffins in which the dead came home.
