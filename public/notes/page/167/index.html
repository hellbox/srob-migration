          If you&rsquo;re upset about Tuesday&rsquo;s election results leaning very conservative across the country, you really ought to go to Town Hall tonight. Ari Berman, who was kind enough to do an Election Day interview with us, will read from Give Us the Ballot, his compelling history of the struggle for voting rights in America. Berman will also be in conversation with Washington state Supreme Court Justice Steven Gonzalez about local results and what we can do to increase voter turnout here.

          It&rsquo;s almost time for holiday shopping. But before we get down to the arduousness of — ugh — buying books for other people, you should visit Third Place Books and Third Place Books Ravenna this weekend. On Saturday and Sunday, all used books in both locations are 40 percent off. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite book sales of the year, and a great chance to get some selfish book-buying done before it&rsquo;s time to start thinking of other people again.

          Has anyone yet written a how-to-write book for how-to-write books? If it hasn’t happened yet, we’re probably closing in on that moment in literary history. Lots of people — myself included —enjoy being hypnotized by the soothing rhythm and encouraging cadence of how-to-write guides. After a certain point, all the tips and tricks and affirming quotations blend together into a whirl of positivity, but a good writing guide stands out: Stephen King’s On Writing is one, and Anne Lamott’s Bird by Bird, and John Gardner’s The Art of Fiction, and Natalie Goldberg’s Writing Down the Bones.

          We&rsquo;re in a golden age of Brian K. Vaughan comics. I can&rsquo;t shut up about how good Saga is; he recently wrapped up The Private Eye, a beautiful sci-fi comic with Marcos Martin; his Canadian future war comic We Stand On Guard keeps getting better; and his newest series, the retro sci-fi adventure comic Paper Girls, is probably his best non-Saga comics work yet. Co-created with artist Cliff Chiang, Paper Girls tells the story of a group of newspaper delivery girls in 1988.

          Burglars stole nearly a thousand dollars from the delightful Couth Buzzard Books on Greenwood Ave over the weekend, reports Phinneywood.com. That&rsquo;s a lot of money, especially for a store that&rsquo;s still a month away from the holiday rush. On the Couth Buzzard Facebook page, owner Theo Dzielak writes:
Some of you have asked how you can help. Well, come on by and say hello, grab a great drink, some food and check out our great selection of new and used books.

        <div class="content">
          Yesterday saw an avalanche of think-pieces and first-person accounts of the launch day for Amazon Books, the online retailer&rsquo;s first physical bookstore in University Village. The most notorious of these hot takes was Megan Garber&rsquo;s piece for the Atlantic, titled &ldquo;Did Amazon Just Replace the Public Library?&rdquo; I honestly can&rsquo;t tell if Garber&rsquo;s piece is supposed to be a joke or a troll or not. It certainly reads like it&rsquo;s trying to be funny.

Danielle and David Hulton didn’t know anything about running a bookstore when they founded Ada’s Technical Books five years ago. That’s probably for the best — the bookselling industry has been dying for at least four decades, according to the bookselling industry. Experienced booksellers tend to get so mired in gloom and doom that they’d likely never get around to opening a new bookstore. Sometimes it takes a novice to get it right.

        <div class="content">
          The Nation contributing writer Ari Berman’s excellent new book Give Us the Ballot tracks the history of voting rights in America from the 1950s to today. No less a civil rights giant than Congressman John Lewis calls Berman’s history a “must-read” that “should become a primer for every American” on the topic of voting equality. (Lewis, of course, figures heavily into *Ballot*’s narrative.) This Friday, Berman appears in conversation with Supreme Court Justice Steven Gonzalez at Town Hall to talk about the state of voting rights nationally and in Washington State.

you troll the Asian produce stands
