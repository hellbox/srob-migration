        <div class="content">
          Poetry Northwest is one of Seattle&rsquo;s great treasures &mdash; a journal that&rsquo;s been publishing since 1959. We&rsquo;re thrilled to have them as a sponsor this week. Their upcoming issue &mdash; available the first week of April &mdash; is a must-read. Maybe don&rsquo;t judge it only by its cover, but that image by David Hytone is enough to get us excited. In fact, did you know that none other than Mark Tobey did their early cover art?

        <div class="content">
          Imagine a world in which booksellers can break into your home and steal back books that you bought from them. That, basically, is a reality with e-books. Chris Meadows wrote for TeleRead an account of how Barnes &amp; Noble &ldquo;stole&rdquo; the first e-book he ever bought. He even contacted Barnes &amp; Noble to complain, and they told him he could re-buy the e-book from them if he wanted. A couple days later, Barnes &amp; Noble did decide to give Meadows back the e-book that he purchased.

          All this month, I’ve been interviewing Seattle-area school librarians. They have, to a person, been delightful interviews: friendly, optimistic, and eager to talk about their work. Almost every one of them told me that they believe they have the best job in the world.
But they’ve also all talked about a problem that plagues every school librarian in Seattle. It’s a problem that is frankly unbelievable for a modern American city, especially one that considers itself to be as progressive as Seattle does.

          Tonight&rsquo;s APRIL Festival 5th Anniversary Party was a solid mix of new-to-APRIL readers (Hannah Sanghee Park delivered a witty spray of poems about love and &ldquo;going to town on a tangerine&rdquo;) and longtime APRIL favorites (Ed Skoog always classes up a room, even when he&rsquo;s reading a poem about puppets). But they saved the real news for the end of the night: APRIL co-founder Willie Fitzgerald announced that APRIL&rsquo;s managing director, Tara Atkinson, would be stepping down after this year&rsquo;s festival.

          In the end, our bones say a lot about who we were.
Ways of identifying sex lie in the shape of the pelvis, the jaw. If you place a thumb in the socket of a pelvic bone and it’s a tight fit, it belongs to the body of a male; female pelvic sockets are roomier. You can tell if someone was right-handed or left by the extra musculature attached to the dominant side.

**Dear Cienna,**
Sometimes when I buy books from used bookstores, I feel bad, especially if they&rsquo;re from small presses. Authors get royalties, however small, on each book sold new in bookstores.

          We just received some exciting news from Poetry Northwest, the longest-running poetry magazine in the Pacific Northwest. There are three huge announcements, so let&rsquo;s tease them out in order.
First of all, longtime Poetry Northwest editor Kevin Craft is stepping down. Craft has long been a faithful ambassador, cheerleader, and ringleader of the Northwest&rsquo;s poetry scene. You&rsquo;ll find him in the stands at major poetry events around Seattle all the time, catching up with local poets and making introductions.

          Washington State Poet Laureate Tod Marshall announced that he&rsquo;s looking for new poems (PDF) from Washington poets for a book titled Washington 129. Unsurprisingly, he&rsquo;ll publish one poem from 129 different poets — that&rsquo;s one poet for each year of Washington&rsquo;s statehood. The gist of the announcement:
*Washington 129* is accepting submissions until January 31, 2017. Previously published poems will not be considered. Please submit no more than three poems as a single Microsoft Word attachment or as the body of an email to submissions@humanities.
