        <div class="content">
          On Wednesday, October 21, I conducted an email interview with Marcellus Turner (interlocuted by SPL Communications Director Andra Addison), and I asked him three questions about the rebranding effort.
**Who first proposed rebranding SPL? Why did you come out so strongly in favor of rebranding rather than some other means of obtaining your ends?**
I know that once I arrived at The Seattle Public Library, I recognized some areas that needed review, our look and brand being one of them.

        <div class="content">
          _Update: 10:57am. Following the post is an email update from Seattle Public Library's Director of Communications, Andra Addison_.
The Seattle Public Library Board of Trustees appears to be responding proactively to the barrage of criticism the SPL rebranding initiative has received from patrons, the public, library donors, and the media over the course of the last month. Board members have called for a Special Meeting to vote on the rebranding initiative before their Wednesday, October 28th regularly scheduled meeting which has the branding initiative on the agenda.

          Today we&rsquo;re dedicating the Seattle Review of Books to the Seattle Public Library, and City Librarian Marcellus Turner&rsquo;s proposed re-branding. We even published Paul&rsquo;s normal Monday Week in Readings post last night, to keep our focus.
We&rsquo;re publishing three pieces today on the topic:
At 10:00am Laurel Holliday, who [previously covered the public response](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/21/public-response-to-spl-survey-sharply-against-city-librarian-marcellus-turners-rebranding-plan/ "The Seattle Review of Books - Public response to SPL survey sharply against City Librarian Marcellus Turner&#39;s rebranding plan"

          MONDAY Ada’s Technical Books kicks off our week in events with NASA scientist ** Les Johnson**, who will be discussing his book Harvesting Space for a Greener Earth&hellip;And Beyond! Press materials promise that Johnson will discuss “how we can use space resources to help solve energy and environmental problems on Earth while simultaneously putting in place the infrastructure to allow sustained exploration of Mars.” Now that you&rsquo;ve seen The Martian and you&rsquo;re all stressed about what would happen if you get trapped on Mars by yourself, you should probably start preparing for just that eventuality.

 Doug gets an unkind review. We are worried. Will one of us dopily bring it up in workshop? We don’t. Doug does. Right off the bat. He wants to talk about it, because he feels there might be something in it for us. The talk he gives us is beautiful, honest, courageous, totally generous.

It&rsquo;s funny, smart, and we think that after you look at two chapters on our sponsor page, you might even want your own copy. Those chapters will only be up through tomorrow, so go take a look today!
G.G. partnered with us as part of our drive to make internet advertising 100 percent less terrible. We ask that you look at our sponsors each week, and see if they speak to you.

          If you have gone, or can&rsquo;t go, to our recommended reading in Bellevue today, come tonight and see Johanna Sinisalo at Elliott Bay Bookstore! She&rsquo;ll be introduced by Lola Rogers, who just wrote about Sinisalo for us earlier this week.
Sinisalo is truly remarkable &mdash; a writer of the strange and wonderful. Modern spec fic fans will love her work, and her travelling to Seattle from her home in Finland is a rare occasion worth celebrating.

        <div class="content">
          Seattle poet (and Seattle Review of Books contributor) Anastacia Renee Tolbert read as part of the Furnace Reading Series at Hollow Earth Radio earlier this month. She told a story featuring the city of Seattle as a protagonist. Now that reading is available online for free. If you&rsquo;ve only ever experienced Tolbert&rsquo;s writing in print form, you&rsquo;re in for a real treat; her spoken word performances are absolutely riveting, and she can turn a room into a party, or a funeral, or church, just with just a few well-placed syllables.
