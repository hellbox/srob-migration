        <div class="content">
          A few Seattle-area booksellers have achieved celebrity status. They’re the names that PR people from New York publishers casually drop when they discuss the Seattle market, the booksellers that other booksellers look to for recommendations, the superstars who represent regional booksellers on panels and in organizations. Queen Anne Book Company bookseller Tegan Tigani is absolutely one of those celebrity booksellers. (If you need any more proof of her celebrity status, consider that Montana author Shann Ray recently waxed rhapsodic on the cadence of her name in the middle of an onstage interview.

          How Technology Hijacks People’s Minds — from a Magician and Google’s Design Ethicist A peek inside the designer&rsquo;s mind, and how navigation and other tricks by designers and companies trick you into feeling like you have choice, when in fact you&rsquo;re being guided through a very specific experience. The author, Tristan Harris, was Google&rsquo;s design ethicist, so is deeply familiar with all the techniques.
By shaping the menus we pick from, technology hijacks the way we perceive our choices and replaces them new ones.

          The awesome organizers of comics and art show Short Run made a special announcement about their upcoming fall show: Special guests at the show this year will include Vanessa Davis and Trevor Alixopulos. Davis&rsquo;s comic Make Me a Woman was published by Drawn &amp; Quarterly, and Alixopulos is an up-and-comer who will be in the newest volume of the Kramer&rsquo;s Ergot anthology. In case you&rsquo;ve missed it, Short Run also revealed the identity of this year&rsquo;s Dash grant recipient, a program that provides funds to an artist to make a new comic in time for the show; this year&rsquo;s Dash winner is a new-to-Seattle cartoonist named Brendan Kiefer.

The Seattle International Film Festival kicks off tonight, and the next four weeks will bring hundreds of movies from around the world to venues throughout the region. You should absolutely take part in SIFF; it’s one of the cultural events that shapes and defines the city. Because we know you love books — you’re on this site, after all — we thought we’d assemble SIFF’s most literary films into an alphabetical list for you, along with SIFF’s descriptions.

        <div class="content">
          All the cool literary people are writing comics now. Ta-Nehisi Coates is doing an excellent job with Black Panther, Margaret Atwood’s comic Angel Catbird is coming out sometime this year, and yesterday the very first issue of sci-fi legend William Gibson’s very first comic, Archangel, hit the stands. Co-created with screenwriter Michael St. John Smith and illustrated by comics veteran Butch Guice, Archangel is closer to Gibson&rsquo;s previously published work than, say, Black Panther is to Between the World and Me, but Gibson is definitely marking new territory here; this is not a lazy cash-grab Neuromancer sequel in comic form or anything so crass.
