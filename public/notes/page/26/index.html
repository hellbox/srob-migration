          Over the weekend, some comments made at a sales conference by Marvel Comics&rsquo;s Senior VP of Sales, David Gabriel, set the internet on fire. Gabriel was referring to a recent sales slump for Marvel books, and he seemed to place the entire blame for the slump on Marvel&rsquo;s attempts at diversity:
What we heard was that **people didn’t want any more diversity. They didn’t want female characters out there**. That’s what we heard, whether we believe that or not.

          Colleen Louise Barry publishes weird and wonderful books under the name Mount Analogue. It’s not just the name of her press so much as a pseudonym; the names “Mount Analogue” and “Colleen Louise Barry” are basically synonymous, the way “Nine Inch Nails” and “Trent Reznor” can be swapped out interchangeably.

Her books have a small print run and, externally, a minimalistic aesthetic. (Barry cites low-impact press Publication Studio as an inspiration for Mount Analogue’s look.

Dear Cienna,
What do you think about posthumously releasing books that authors didn’t want us to see? On the one hand, you get unnecessary books like Nabokov’s *The Original of Laura*, and on the other, there’s Kafka’s entire oeuvre.
