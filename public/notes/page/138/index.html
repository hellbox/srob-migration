        <div class="content">
          This is big news: independent comics publisher Image Comics — home of some of the best ongoing comics series in America today including Saga, The Walking Dead, and Bitch Planet — just announced that they&rsquo;re going to host Image Expo, their new-title showcase, at Emerald City Comicon this year. This is the first time they&rsquo;ve partnered with a pre-existing convention for the Expo, and it&rsquo;s also the first time the Expo will take place in Seattle.

        <div class="content">
          The thing you realize within a few seconds of talking to University Book Store’s Caitlin is that she reads a lot. Like, a lot. She estimates she plows through about five books a week, on average. “I read fast,” she admits. “Partly because when I was in college, I would do theater, and I would also have to read James Fenimore Cooper or *Moby Dick*” for class assignments. Every time I see Caitlin, she’s gushing about some book that just came out, or that is about to come out, or that will be out in a month or two.

        <div class="content">
          After a long weekend, we&rsquo;re left with too much news for one single Book News Roundup to contain!
 Capitol Hill Seattle Blog has the skinny on V2, the new temporary arts space in the old Value Village building on Capitol Hill&rsquo;s 11th Ave. Literary tenants include Bumbershoot producer One Reel and possibly Hugo House, and the space will be broken up into &ldquo;performance areas, rental studios, classrooms, offices, and storage.

        <div class="content">
          Two Sylvias Press&rsquo;s annual chapbook contest is now open for submissions. The reading fee is $15, but the payoff is pretty great: the winner gets $400 and 20 copies of their finished chapbook. A poem by the winner of 2014&rsquo;s chapbook contest, Cecilia Woloch, was recently featured in the New York Times Magazine.
 We&rsquo;ve already suggested two great events for tonight, but we just learned about this event happening in the Husky Union Building on the UW campus tonight, and we wanted you to know about it: an evening of Arabic Poetry and Music, featuring poetry read in English and in Arabic by students.

          _[to be read very quickly, as if almost out of breath]_
Panic blossom speaks passwords into the edge of the voice at the edge of the speech that listens. The password for membrane is not squirrels. It is also not squirrels of intestinal magic. It is not
squirrels that ride the antlers of your skin.
Every sink will be shallow and the deer with eight legs will run faster but on a treadmill of paper.

        <div class="content">
          In his introduction to the Hugo House’s Lit Series event on Friday night, event programmer Peter Mountford called “what goes around comes around” the “immaculate conception of clichés.” Most clichés, he said, have very clear, recognizable origins, but “what goes around comes around” has existed for as long as language has existed, and it can’t be broken down into any simpler parts. It’s one of the clearest, simplest concepts that exists in written language.

          Our thanks to Sagging Meniscus Press for sponsoring the site this week with a truly unique, and remarkable, book: The Too-Brief Chronicle of Judah Lowe, by Christopher Carter Sanderson. On our sponsors page we have three excerpts: from the introduction, which sets the stage, and from each of the two sections of the book, each told through the lens of severe restriction. All art comes from the artist creating rules and restrictions &mdash; some of them mundane, such as the choice of paint or the size of canvas, some of them severe (those of you who saw the brilliant film The Five Obstructions will know what we&rsquo;re talking about).

Debbie Clarke Moderow reads from her new book Fast into the Night: A Woman, Her Dogs, and Their Journey North on the Iditarod Trail. If you’ve ever wondered about sled dogs — and c’mon, pretty much everybody has wondered about sled dogs — this is a good chance to learn.
TUESDAY Seattle author Matt Ruff finally debuts his long-awaited novel Lovecraft Country at Elliott Bay Book Company tonight!

          [Samuel R. Delany Speaks](http://www.thenation.com/article/samuel-r-delany-speaks/) Wonderful interview with the one and only Samuel R. Delany, by Cecilia D&rsquo;Anastasio.
 When he was 11, Samuel R. Delany stayed overnight at a Harlem hospital for observation. It was 1953, and nearly a decade before Delany would publish his first science-fiction novel. He had already realized he was gay. With trepidation, he asked the doctor, a white man, how many gays existed in America. The doctor laughed.
