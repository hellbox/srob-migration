        <div class="content">
          I can&rsquo;t stop thinking of the item from yesterday&rsquo;s Book News Roundup about Harper Lee&rsquo;s estate pulling the plug on the mass market paperback edition of To Kill a Mockingbird. Mass market paperbacks, of course, aren&rsquo;t nearly as profitable as hardcovers or trade paperbacks; that&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t see them so much anymore. If you can coax audiences into paying more than double for the same set of words, I guess the thinking goes, why wouldn&rsquo;t you?

          Tonight is the first night of the APRIL Festival, the annual celebration of Authors, Publishers, and Readers of Independent Literature. Now through Sunday, APRIL will be putting on events around Capitol and First Hill. Most of those events are absolutely free. But I wanted to alert you to the two events that are ticketed: Thursday night&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Poet, a Playwright, a Novelist and a Drag Queen&rdquo; competitive storytelling event and Friday night&rsquo;s Five-Year Anniversary party.

          I need bread for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Sweet grain, salted grain, I want so much
To swallow you whole. I&rsquo;m a damn sinner
Who can only be saved by your fingers.
Hurry, place the sacred bread on my tongue
And consecrate breakfast, lunch, and dinner &mdash;
Or maybe not. I wish I were slimmer
And more disciplined &mdash; a secular monk!
But I lust, lust and lust. I&rsquo;m a sinner

        <div class="content">
          The Booker-winning author of novels including Hotel du Lac, Altered States, and The Rules of Engagement died at the age of 87. Brookner had the kind of career to which most novelists should aspire: long, productive, and meaningful. You could choose any one of her books at random and be assured that you&rsquo;re about to read a stylistically powerful, satisfying novel. That&rsquo;s the best kind of legacy.

          Seattle ice creamery Full Tilt debuts a Nancy Pearl-themed ice cream on April 10th, reports Seattle Metropolitan. What does Nancy Pearl ice cream taste like? It&rsquo;s peanut butter with a fudge swirl.
 Harper Lee&rsquo;s estate has reportedly killed the mass-market edition of To Kill a Mockingbird. This is going to make the book inaccessible for public schools around the country. What&rsquo;s this mean? Alex Shephard at the New Republic writes:

          This week&rsquo;s sponsor, the APRIL Festival, kicks off with a bang Tuesday night at the Pine Box, with performances by Alejandro de Acosta, Sara Jaffe, Jenny Zhang and Kelly Froh. Doors open at 7:30pm.
Then, every night this week, and into the weekend, the festival goes strong. We have a full event listing on our sponsor&rsquo;s page for you to plan your festival week. We hope, at the very least, to see you on Sunday at the APRIL Book Expo at Hugo House, where the Seattle Review of Books will have a table.

          Audra Gallegos, school librarian at Lawton Elementary School, started out as a teacher. Why’d she make the switch to librarian? Being a teacher “didn’t turn out to be literary enough,” she says. “When WASL became more important, the writing became more dry. It was less about experiencing the world through literature and more about writing essays.”
“I’d always wanted to be a librarian because I’m such a reader,” Gallegos explains, so she took a two-year, part-time certificate program at University of Washington.

What&rsquo;s it like, in this modern age, to join a secret society made primarily, so it seems, to evoke the wonder that one might have joining a secret society?
 “Can you keep a secret?” I blinked. I didn’t know Justin very well.
