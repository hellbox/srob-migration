          Time was, you just had to keep your eye on a few New York publications in order to see if there was any new writing from the top authors in the country. Now, thankfully, there are infinitely more outlets available. Case in point: earlier this month, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie published a great essay about the state of feminism on her Facebook page, and it&rsquo;s slowly been making the rounds ever since.

The Twitter feed of Chick Publications is reporting that Jack Chick, the religious cartoonist famous for his pocket-sezed &ldquo;Chick tracts&rdquo;, has died. His comics were incredibly hateful — they insisted that basically anyone who is not straight, white, and Evangelical is a failure of a human being who deserves to burn in hell — but they were also hugely influential.
An army of artoonists, ranging from Dan Clowes to Steve Ellis and Fred Van Lente, have parodied Chick tracts.

          As Louis Collins and I discuss his nearly half-century in the book business, it’s impossible for me to not take notice of his goofy blue sweatshirt, which reads “I TOOK THE PLUNGE! SPA HOT SPRINGS MOTEL WHITE SULFUR SPRINGS, MT.” Collins, the owner of our September Bookstore of the Month, Louis Collins Books, comes across as eminently comfortable in his own skin; he seems happy with his lot in life.

          “A Honeypot For Assholes”: Inside Twitter’s 10-Year Failure To Stop Harassment Charlie Warzel, in BuzzFeed, on the history and intention of Twitter&rsquo;s abuse problem.
 “What was once lauded as a virtue has now become the company’s Achilles’ heel — it’s the axis around which all this shit with harassment rotates,” a former senior employee told BuzzFeed News. Nearly all former employees BuzzFeed News spoke to in the course of reporting this story said the same thing.

          I got my ballot in the mail last night and I happily voted and mailed the damn thing back immediately and it felt so damned good, like the horse that&rsquo;s been sitting square in the center of my chest finally got up and moseyed away in search of some hay or something. (Not that you asked me or anything, but I heartily recommend Seattlish&rsquo;s voting guide to help identify the lesser-known names on the ballot.
