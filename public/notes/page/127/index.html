          Over the weekend at the APRIL Book Expo, The Seattle Review of Books table was directly next to Yeti Press, the small comics publisher run by Fantagraphics employee RJ Casey in his free time. (Yes, Casey runs a comic book company when he’s not busy working at a day job for a comic book company. I suspect he also runs a smaller comic book company when he’s looking to unwind from his other two comic book companies.

          The Japan News reports:
A short-form novel “coauthored” by humans and an artificial intelligence (AI) program passed the first screening process for a domestic literary prize, it was announced on Monday. However, the book did not win the final prize. Some of you out there may interpret this news as apocalyptic. If so, you should be warned that the apocalypse is upon us already: news agencies publish stories written by robots on a regular basis, though this programmer&rsquo;s prediction that a robot would win the Pulitzer by 2016 seems unlikely to come true.

          **Wednesday March 23: Robert Sawyer**
Sawyer’s science fiction novels are about what happens when you introduce one high-concept sci-fi element to an otherwise ordinary world. He then spends the rest of the book examining the ramifications of that collision. His newest, *Quantum Night*, uses experimental psychology and quantum physics to explore human nature. *University Book Store, 4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, [bookstore.washington.edu](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu). Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*

          Shakespeare&rsquo;s First Folio is now at the Seattle Public Library. (At the Seattle Times, Mary Ann Gwinn wrote about the opening festivities for the Folio.) You can find a full calendar of Folio-related events — including readings, movies, plays, music and more — on SPL&rsquo;s website, and you can get tickets to visit the Folio here.
 You can now sign up for Hugo House&rsquo;s spring quarter classes online.

          Due to a filing error, we mistakenly attributed a poem by a different poet to Jane Wong. The mistake was entirely ours, and we have deleted the post from the site and social media. We apologize to Jane Wong for the egregious mistake, and to our readers, and we’ll put procedures in place to ensure it won’t happen again.

          The (I guess NSFW, maybe?) photograph of the &ldquo;naked language mural&rdquo; by artist Vladimiro Lunardon up at The New Post-Literate is a thing of beauty. It&rsquo;s exactly what reading great literature feels like to me. Lunardon&rsquo;s art employs lots of writing-like imagery, and some of it is really quite beautiful.
 The great Roger Langridge has a new cartoon of &ldquo;Abandoned First Drafts&rdquo; up on his blog for your enjoyment.
