          Every month, Daneet Steffens uncovers the latest goings on in mystery, suspense, and crime fiction. See previous columns on the [Criminal Fiction archive page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/criminal-fiction)
Over the past couple of weeks, it’s been a real pleasure to while away several hours in the podcast-presence of Two Crime Writers and a Microphone. UK crime fiction scribes Steve Cavanagh and Luca Veste deliver silly laughs &mdash; how about those ducks? &mdash; as well as more practical pearls of wisdom, chatting about publishing news (and some non-publishing news, too), hosting book reviewers, and interviewing fellow crime fiction writers like Ian Rankin, Stuart Neville &mdash; who contributes the podcast’s twangy-groovy interstitial music &mdash; CL Taylor, Craig Robertson, Mark Billingham, and Ruth Ware.

For decades, American retail employees called the day after Thanksgiving “Black Friday,” but they did so in the stockrooms and break rooms of their stores, away from customers. Managers used the term because Thanksgiving weekend sales are what typically drive a store’s yearly profits into the black. Ground-level employees called the day “Black Friday” because it was so brutal it could kill you.
At some point, “Black Friday entered the popular vernacular as the name of an official shopping holiday, and that was when holiday shopping started to get really out of hand; without “Black Friday” as a popular concept, you don’t get Target employees who have to leave their family’s Thanksgiving dinners early so they can open the store for a bunch of ungrateful yahoos who will happily murder their neighbors to get their hands on a deeply discounted flat screen TV.

          News broke yesterday that author William Trevor passed away. Literary Hub has a wonderful roundup of audio and visual files of Trevor appearances and remembrances of Trevor by other authors.
 Sadly appropriate for our time: Umberto Eco&rsquo;s list of 14 common features of fascism. Here&rsquo;s number seven:
  The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.

          If a tree falls in the woods
And no one is there to hear it

If a police officer shoots a black kid
and no one saw the bullet
Is the black kid really dead?
If a white man goes on a killing spree is he a terrorist?
Or mentally ill?
Or a wolf in white skin?
If the black kid does not get a hashtag

Our inspiring sponsor, Susan Marie Conrad, did something many of us want to do, but almost nobody does: she kayaked the entire Inside Passage, from Anacortes to Juneau, Alaska. You and I both know this story is more than just the logistics of paddling, and Conrad delivers a great story in her book _Inside: One Woman’s Journey Though the Inside Passage_. It's well-told, rife with personal accomplishment, and that kind of self-examination that only comes from pitting oneself against nature.

          Chaim Gartenberg at The Verge writes about the really neat idea behind Recommendmeabook.com:
Designed by developer Givi Phirtskhalava, the site presents you with the first page of a novel as a blank, standalone item without title, author, or cover, allowing you to experience the beginning of a book without coloring it with any preconceived ideas. You just read the first page and if you like it, you push a button to reveal the title and author.

I arrived in Seattle on May 4th, 2000. I applied for a job at Elliott Bay Book Company two days later. My first day at Elliott Bay Book Company was May 15th. I cannot express how important being hired at Elliott Bay was for me, what it did for my life. I had worked at a Borders in Boston for years, but Elliott Bay was, quite obviously, something different. It was more serious than Borders, felt more like a place of worship.

          Obama Reckons With a Trump Presidency This David Remnick piece has received a lot of, rightful, attention this week. Imagine being one of the most capable, measured, and successful presidents of the modern age, and handing off to the hot gilded mess approaching the front gates. The horror.
But Obama has remarkable statesmen like resolve, and as he told a crowd recently, &ldquo;I’m going to be constrained in what I do with all of you until I am again a private citizen.
