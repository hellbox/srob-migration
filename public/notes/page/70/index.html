        <div class="content">
          In the nearly five decades that Louis Collins has been selling books, he’s seen the book business completely transform itself. “I started off cataloguing books, sending out-of-print and hard-to-find books, mostly to institutions” out of his office in San Francisco he tells me. “In those days before the internet there was a magazine called the AB Bookman’s Weekly,” which served as a marketplace of rare and out-of-print books and a central meeting-place for the used bookselling community.

          America’s Therapists Are Worried About Trump’s Effect On Your Mental Health  The rhetoric of hate and divisiveness lead to hate and divisiveness. Trump is nothing less than the dismantling of American sanity.
 Over the summer, some 3,000 therapists signed a self-described manifesto declaring Trump’s proclivity for scapegoating, intolerance and blatant sexism a “threat to the well-being of the people we care for” and urging others in the profession to speak out against him.

          Everybody in Seattle is freaking out about the promised weekend wind storm that has whipped Cliff Mass into one of his rare meteorological lathers. Seattle Review of Books readers should know that two scheduled readings with local authors this weekend have been postponed due to weather:
 Priscilla Long’s scheduled Elliott Bay Book Company event celebrating the launch of her two new books, Fire and Stone: Where Do We Come From?

        <div class="content">
          When news broke that Bob Dylan won the Nobel Prize for Literature, [we published a post questioning the wisdom]( http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/10/13/bob-dylan-wins-2016-nobel-prize-for-literature/) of giving the prize to a world-famous musician. Later that day, *Seattle Review of Books* co-founders Martin McClellan and Paul Constant had a conversation on Slack about whether music should be included in the same context as literature. That conversation turned into an exploration of what literature can (and possibly can’t) do.

          Well, it&rsquo;s been another banner week in the history of our great republic. The democratic process has never seemed so&hellip;well, uh. Yeah.
Maybe the appropriate way to close out your workweek, then, is to listen to KUOW&rsquo;s Elizabeth Austen and Marcie Sillman introduce Karen Finneyfrock&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;The Newer Colossus,&rdquo; which is written from the perspective of the Statue of Liberty. Finneyfrock&rsquo;s version of Liberty is weary. She&rsquo;s seen too many anti-immigration hypocrites, from her island.
