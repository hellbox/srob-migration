          Last week, Fernando Alfonso III wrote at the Lexington Herald Leader:
An Eastern Kentucky police chief has removed large decals with the Punisher skull and “Blue Lives Matter” from eight police cars after a backlash following the publication of a Herald-Leader story.
The Catlettsburg Police department, which employs eight full-time and two part-time officers for a population of about 2,500, featured the images on the hoods of its 2013 and 2017 Ford Interceptor sedans and sport-utility vehicles, assistant police chief Gerry Hatzel said.

        <div class="content">
          For years, Amazon has offered commissions to book bloggers who link to books on Amazon. In other words, if you were reading a review on a blog and you clicked the link on the blog to buy that book on Amazon, you&rsquo;d be sending a small amount of money the bloggers&rsquo; way. It&rsquo;s called the affiliate program. Some book blogs have grown to depend on affiliate revenue over the years, and Amazon relied on affiliates to serve, effectively, as handsellers for the company.

          We told you last night that the bidding war for memoirs from Barack and Michelle Obama reached $60 million. Last night, Penguin Random House announced that they won the rights to publish the books. They&rsquo;re expected to arrive in 2018. Penguin Random House&rsquo;s CEO promises to &ldquo;make each of their books global publishing events of unprecedented scope and significance.&rdquo;

          With Emerald City Comicon landing at the Convention Center, all of Seattle is suffering from a ferocious case of nerd fever this weekend. But if you can’t make it to the show, you shouldn’t feel as though you’re missing out on the fun. In fact, the after-parties and side events — all of which are open to the public, even those who don’t have an ECCC lanyard — look to be more exciting than the main event.

          We&rsquo;ve got two open sponsorships in March we&rsquo;d love to get into your hands. We&rsquo;ve discounted them — $50 off for next week, March 6 - March 12, and $25 off for the week after, March 13 - March 19. Grab &lsquo;em quick!
We&rsquo;re also in super-secret testing with some new sponsorship types. Besides events and books, we&rsquo;d love to promote opportunities for writers (contests, call-for-entries, retreats, and anything else), and charitable giving.

Patti Hartigan, a former theater critic for the *Boston Globe*, has been signed to write the first major biography of August Wilson, the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and one of the most significant voices in 20th-century American literature. 37 INK, an imprint at Atria Books, plans to publish the book, tentatively titled “August Wilson: The Kiln in Which He Was Fired,” in late 2019.
