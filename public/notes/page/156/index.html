**Dear Cienna,**
**Has there ever been a movie adaptation that's better than the book it's supposed to be based on?**
**Douglas, West Seattle**
Dear Douglas,
That's like comparing apples to Amtrak.

        <div class="content">
          UNESCO just released their full list of new members of the Creative Cities Network. Seattle, which was making its second bid to become a City of Literature, is not on that list. UNESCO does not make its deliberations public, but it&rsquo;s not hard to come up with reasons why we might not have made the list this year.
The sad thing is, after the unpleasantness of the spring passed, our City of Literature organization found a terrific, capable leader in Bob Redmond.

          Toward the end of Bethany Jean Clement&rsquo;s Seattle Times scoop about the sudden and mysterious closure of the Bauhaus coffee mini-chain, there&rsquo;s this additional terrible news:
And Twice Sold Tales in Ballard [posted on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10153410672558871&id=132445238870): “Bauhaus Ballard, which my bookstore subleases from, is closing.

          We just got an invitation from Thomas Walton, the founder of PageBoy Magazine, which is one of the best print lit mags in the city.

Please join *PageBoy Magazine* for the inaugural episode of Art Party.

        <div class="content">
          In the back pages of the first issue of the new series Symmetry, writer Matt Hawkins admits he’s “gotten a bit sick of” dystopia’s omnipresence, and so he decided to try writing utopian fiction, instead. He read Sir Thomas More’s Utopia (“it’s boring as hell,” Hawkins tells his readers, urging them to “skim it”) and embarked on months of research, determining the four qualities of all utopias in fiction (ambition, creativity, diversity, and instruments of capital must be eliminated) and what he believes to be the four pillars of society (community, peace, harmony, and equality are required).

        <div class="content">
          For some time now, City Councilmember Nick Licata has sponsored a neat event at City Hall called the Words&rsquo; Worth Poetry Series. Selected poets would read a poem to kick off City Council meetings. It was a small gesture, but an important one: it&rsquo;s always good to remind the City Council that the arts is what makes Seattle so wonderfully livable.
Today, Seattle poet Sierra Nelson says:
City Councilmember Nick Licata is leaving City Council at the end of this term, and to celebrate his innovative Words’ Worth Poetry Series and legacy of championing the arts in Seattle, current Words’ Worth curator, poet and performer Sierra Nelson, has invited past curators and readers to return to Seattle City Hall (600 4th Ave, City Council meeting room) on Wednesday, December 9th, 2015, 2:00-2:15 p.

          Ask a thousand booksellers what you should buy as a gift for the holidays and you’ll get a thousand different answers. There’s no single perfect gift. But Letizia, a bookseller at University Book Store, is really excited about Sandra Cisneros’s book A House of My Own, and she thinks you should be, too.

Letizia’s voice bubbles over with enthusiasm for House. It’s “a collection of essays, articles, and non-fiction stories” that Cisneros has “compiled and collected over the past 30 years.

Registration for Hugo House members was open a week ago, but now anybody can sign up. We&rsquo;re going to have a lot of fun in this class &mdash; you&rsquo;ll walk away with a deep understanding of reviewing, and with a number of finished reviews on books you feel passionately about.

          Margaret Atwood&rsquo;s first comic is called Angel Catbird, it&rsquo;s an all-ages story about a hero who gets his genes spliced with a bird and a cat, it comes out fall 2016 from Dark Horse Comics, and it&rsquo;s illustrated by the talented Johnnie Christmas, who drew the Image series Sheltered. Sounds weird. I&rsquo;m in.
