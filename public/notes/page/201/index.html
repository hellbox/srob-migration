        <div class="content">
          Hugo House is hosting a one-day poetry broadside workshop Saturday August 8, run by local poet J.T. Stewart, and master typographer John D. Berry. Poets will walk away with printed broadsides of their work.
Broadsides were once the currency of the poetry underground. Learning how to design and print them is a great opportunity, especially if you&rsquo;ve never seen your work come to life on paper right before your eyes. Having this level of experience and guidance available to you is a rare opportunity.

          Holy cow, this story has exploded in such a weird way.
Founder Nick Denton plans to relaunch [Gawker], which has been publishing fewer stories since the scandal began, with a heightened focus on **newsworthiness over salaciousness**, according to a report from Digiday. He told staffers at a Thursday meeting the new Gawker.com would be "20 percent nicer" than its previous iteration, Capital New York reported. Also, Gawker&rsquo;s parent company, Gawker Media, might be changing its name to distance itself from the Gawker brand.

          Dennis Abrams of Publishing Perspectives writes:
Opening this September is the Book and Bed, a new hotel located in Tokyo’s Ikebukuro neighborhood, that, according to Rocket News 24, literally “invites bibliophiles to sleep in the stacks.” They can&rsquo;t promise privacy, but they can promise the opportunity to fall asleep while doing something you love. This is not your only opportunity to sleep in a bookstore: Abrams writes, &ldquo;In Paris, if you’re willing to volunteer time, you can crash at Shakespeare &amp; Co.

        <div class="content">
          The Academy (as in, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to thank the&hellip;&rdquo;) posted this interactive interview with screenwriter John August. It&rsquo;s hard to think of a better advocate for screenwriters than he. Not only has he been answering questions from readers on his blog since for at least fifteen years (well before he was as well-known as he is now), but after falling in hate with the biggest screenwriting software out there, he helped to create an open source plaintext screenwriting standard called Fountain, and then he started a software company to make software to utilize it.

          (*Every comics fan knows that Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country.* Thursday Comics Hangover *is a weekly column reviewing some of the new books that I pick up at [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/), my friendly neighborhood comic book store.*)
I swear every month brings a new comic series about a paranormal investigator. It's one of the most overplayed ideas out there — a down-on-his-luck detective who bumps into demons or vampires or some other creature-of-the-week riff.

          Houstonia magazine responds perfectly to racist readers who complained about an advertisement depicting a mixed-race family. Sometimes the customer is not right. Sometimes the customer is a bigot. In times like that, it&rsquo;s okay to call them out on their bigotry, and to tell them they are not welcome to read the publication anymore. The quality of your readers definitely makes a statement about your publication. In fact, it says a lot more about your publication than the quantity of readers.

          In a three-decade career Moore refined the Archie Comics visual vocabulary, creating arguably the most iconic take on a set of characters who are now recognized all over the world. The (very good) recent attempt to modernize Archie couldn&rsquo;t exist without the sturdy foundations that Moore built.
