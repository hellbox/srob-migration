          This quote, from BuzzFeed chairman Ken Lerer, positively smacks of protesting too much:
“Anyone who thinks that this isn’t a terrific time to be in digital content is dead wrong,” Lerer said. “**It’s a fantastic time**.” Lerer, of course, is talking about the reports that BuzzFeed had to cut its revenue goals for this year by half. Also of note is this line, from Re/Code reporter Peter Kafka, later in the piece:

          **Wednesday April 13: Hope Jahren **
*Lab Girl* is a memoir about sexism in the sciences — the STEM fields are still an old boys’ club — and what it’s like to follow a lifelong love of science. To Jahren, math and analytic thinking isn’t the most important part of being a scientist; having a question is what counts most. *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5.

David Schmader is a goddamned Seattle treasure. From his one-man shows to his Last Days column at *The Stranger* to his new job as [Creative Director at the Bureau of Fearless Ideas](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/27/an-interview-with-david-schmader-the-brand-new-creative-director-at-the-bureau-of-fearless-ideas/), he has improved life in this city by roughly 1000 percent. I worked with Schmader for eight years at *The Stranger* and I'm proud to call him a friend, but the truth is that I still nurse a fan's awe of his writing.

          I always forget who lives
in my city.
No comment on them &mdash;
my memory’s bad.
Or good
for certain things.
Like faces.
Or items
on a grocery list.
Or the precise feelings
a book produced
in me once,
although perhaps not
its phrases or ideas.
But people, you
lovely impenetrables,
too often I forget
you exist.
I don’t find it hard
to reach out to you
in moments &mdash;

        <div class="content">
          This year was the first Emerald City Comicon under the management of national convention chain ReedPOP, and the local comics community was understandably nervous about what that might mean for the region’s largest convention. ECCC director Jim Demonakos assured the media last year that ReedPOP wouldn’t affect the flavor of the convention at all, but comics people are resistant to change and prone to worry, so everyone had their feelers out for problems.

        <div class="content">
          If you&rsquo;re in the Orthodox church, Easter is still ahead, on May 1st this year. We&rsquo;re welcoming back sponsor Charlotte Riggle, whose children&rsquo;s book Catherine&rsquo;s Pascha follows a little girl&rsquo;s quest to stay awake for the overnight Pascha, or Easter, service.
If you&rsquo;re not Orthodox, maybe you&rsquo;ll be wondering why the family next door are loading up the car with sleepy children all dressed up come April 30th. This book is a great way of understanding the faith of your neighbors and friends, and introducing children to the many ways that different people in the world worship.

As Open Books owner John Marshall prepares his poetry bookstore for a new owner and a new future, he can’t help but reflect on the past. Between the old friends sending their best wishes on news of Marshall’s retirement and the prospect of retirement, he describes himself as feeling a little “sentimental.”
“I’m getting lovely memories,” Marshall says. In particular, he’s been remembering some of the liveliest events Open Books has hosted over the last two decades.

          The Voyeur's Motel Let&rsquo;s talk about Gay Talese. When asked last week to name female journalists he admired, he balked, then doubled-down. Not using Twitter, or any social media, a New York Times piece reported that Talese was unaware of the controversy his words inspired until informed a few days later. After that reporting, the New York Times Public Editor responded to the Time&rsquo;s executive editor Dean Baquet talking smack about the very artice.
