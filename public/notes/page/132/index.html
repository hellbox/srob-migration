        <div class="content">
          Seattle publisher Sasquatch Books was celebrated as one of seven fast-growing independent publishers of the year in Publishers Weekly.   As Seattle independent publisher Sasquatch Books enters 2016—its 30th year—the company points to breakout hits such as *The 52 Lists Project* and *A Boat, a Whale, and a Walrus* as keys to its recent success. Known for its list of nonfiction books, Northwest regional titles, and guidebook series, Sasquatch has branched out into a variety of subjects, including cooking, lifestyle, and children’s books.

          She squishes through fish, salmon stacked up to the door,
boots tracking scales in the wheelhouse, on the galley floor,
down the companionway, and in the engine room.
By the end of the day, there are scales on the mast. Scales
on the deck winch, on the ladder and steps. Scales in her hair,
in her gloves, up her sleeves, behind her ears. Scales
like freckles. Scales like glitter. Like bindis, like dragon skin.

Once you get the practice down, most writers will tell you, writing is easy. It&rsquo;s the revising that&rsquo;s tough. When you understand that fact, it&rsquo;s really kind of surprising that aspiring authors spend so much money on how-to-write classes, when it&rsquo;s the revision classes that ought to be their focus.

          Lit Crawl Seattle announced the date for this year&rsquo;s crawl: October 27, 2016. Save the date. (And if you didn&rsquo;t attend last year&rsquo;s Lit Crawl, here&rsquo;s our roundup to give you an idea of what you missed.)
 The MFA in Creative Writing program at Whidbey Island&rsquo;s Northwest Institute of Literary Arts is in serious financial trouble. Here&rsquo;s a letter from a student outlining the problem — &ldquo;We are devastated to learn that, in the middle of our semester, we have no idea if we will continue,&rdquo; she writes — and here&rsquo;s where you can donate to help.

        <div class="content">
          Catherine&rsquo;s Pascha, written by this week&rsquo;s sponsor Charlotte Riggle and illustrated by R.J. Hughes, is about a girl&rsquo;s determination to stay awake for Pascha. In the Orthodox Christian church, Easter services are held in the middle of the night. It&rsquo;s a story of a girl&rsquo;s coming of age in the culture of her family, and learning about tradition and faith.
Charlotte will be appearing March 11th at A Good Book Cafe in Sumner for a Kid&rsquo;s Night in the Bookstore, for snacks, a reading, and a lights out tour of the store with flashlights.

Really, who doesn&rsquo;t stare out at Mount Rainier every once in a while with a sense of foreboding? After all, the eruption of Mount St. Helens is recent enough — in geological terms, it&rsquo;s barely been a matter of seconds — that we all understand what happens when a mountain decides to blow its metaphorical and literal top.

          Big news from Seattle comics publisher Fantagraphics tonight, via the New York Times: President Obama has written the foreword for the upcoming 25th volume of The Complete Peanuts, the chronological reprinting of Charles Schulz&rsquo;s newspaper strip. (This volume collects the very end of the series from 1999 through Schulz&rsquo;s death in February 2000, although a 26th Complete Peanuts volume, collecting ephemera and rare artwork, will be published this fall.) Go read the story to find out how Fantagraphics scored such a coup.

 Emma was very pretty, describing herself as somewhat vain; she wore false hair to frame her face, loved fancy clothes, played cards, went to dances, and wrote of sharing a “bucket of beer” with a friend in Seattle, as the two women commiserated about their errant husbands.
