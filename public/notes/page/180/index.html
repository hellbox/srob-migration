        <div class="content">
          Good news! The Seattle Weekly now has a weekly comics column in whch a local cartoonist illustrates an interview with a local band. In the first installment, the fabulous Robyn Jordan illustrates Janice Headley&rsquo;s interview with the band Childbirth. If you don&rsquo;t know Childbirth, they&rsquo;re a poppy punk band that wears hospital gowns onstage and sing catchy, awesome feminist songs like &ldquo;I Only Fucked You As a Joke.&rdquo;
This is great stuff, and it manages to highlight our amazing comics scene and our amazing music scene, simultaneously.

          We love a good book review here at SRoB, and &ldquo;Donald Trump Reviews The Lord of the Rings,&rdquo; over at the Tusk, is a wonderful book review. This is what we mean when we keep grabbing people by the shoulders and shaking them violently and shouting &ldquo;BOOK REVIEWS ARE LITERATURE!&rdquo; This piece employs satire to comment on a book while also addressing current events. Go read it. (Also, sorry about the grabbing-you-by-the-shoulders-and-shouting thing.

          Porchlit is a yearlong site-specific literary installation founded by Yonnas Getahun, Campbell Thibo and Omar Willey. The idea is a relatively simple one: every day of the year, they record someone reading a piece on the porch of a particular Little Saigon home. Then they post a Soundcloud embed of the reading on the project’s website. When they started the project, they operated under the assumption that the building attached to the porch was abandoned.

        <div class="content">
          The news broke today that Twitter is considering ways to allow users to write posts that are longer than its current 140-character limit. This is, obviously, a bad idea. Twitter with no limits is just blogging. Everyone has problems squeezing words into a tweet every now and again, but the constraint is what makes Twitter magical.
I&rsquo;d argue that the constraint is the thing that makes Twitter so appealing to literary types, too.

        <div class="content">
          This post at Lady Business begins:
This project demonstrates that SFF books by or about cis women are less likely to win awards than books by or about cis men. Trans and nonbinary authors do not win awards at all, and trans or nonbinary protagonists are extremely rare. Overall, there were more award-winning books written by cis men about cis men than there were books by women about anybody... While of course the news they deliver is bad, it&rsquo;s heartening to see other people taking up Nicola Griffith&rsquo;s charge to count the number of womens&rsquo; voices in literature.

          Marcellus Turner, the City Librarian at Seattle Public Library, has issued a letter responding to public criticism of the library&rsquo;s rebranding campaign, which I wrote about last week. Turner writes that the rebranding has&hellip;
...generated a flurry of interest and opinions from media representatives and the public. A recent exchange with a passionate Library supporter got at the heart of the concerns voiced by many around the Library’s proposed rebranding. That supporter didn’t see the need for changing the library name or brand.

Who cares: cunt can’t battle, key won’t tear.
Ugly decay, care for Pa and tell, we lonely.
So jail men care, met a lavish man, met a landlord.

Me, countless, out to tear. Sane no, lend me.

          Galleycat has assembled excerpts of the ten most frequently challenged library books of 2015. Seattle&rsquo;s own Sherman Alexie and Ellen Forney are right up at the top of the list with The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. Go give these books a try, and if you&rsquo;re interested in reading further, please acquire copies of the books from your local library or independent bookstore. Banned Book Week isn&rsquo;t just about celebrating the authors who push the boundaries of what&rsquo;s acceptable; it&rsquo;s also about celebrating the heroes who make those books available for everyone.
