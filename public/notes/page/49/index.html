          He Fixes the Cracked Spines of Books, Without an Understudy In room 111 of the Seattle Public Library central service center, Donald Vass works with glue, iron, paper, and wood to repair books damaged by age, overuse, and mechanical handling. With no apprentice in training, he may be the last to practice the almost medical art of book-mending on our library&#8217;s aging circulation.
And that&#8217;s a shame: not just because the craft is beautiful, but because the practice of repair reflects an attitude of compassion and care that we badly need right now.

Did you know that someone lives atop Smith Tower? Petra Franklin Lahaie holds the lease. She cleared the space after a water tower was removed, converted it into an apartment, and made her home there with her family and her massive Chihuly chandelier.

        <div class="content">
          The humble writing prompt is such a great device. When you&rsquo;re stuck, as a writer, often times the perception is that there aren&rsquo;t any ideas, and that the world is bereft of good plots.
Given the idiosyncrasies of human thinking, what&rsquo;s maybe going on is that you are stuck in your own loops. Prompts, from the brain/emotion loops of other humans, can be helpful to spark an idea. Other&rsquo;s ideas surprise you, like the punchline to a good joke, and in that surprise comes a stepping out of yourself into another possible imagination.

Dear Cienna,
I just got dumped. I need some inspiration — what’s the greatest love story you’ve ever read? One friend gave me a book of Leonard Cohen poems and I almost killed myself.

          The final paragraph of this Seattle Times story about layoffs at KOMO by Rachel Lerman really hammers home how absolutely screwed the Seattle media scene is these days:  NBC News shut down its Seattle-based Breaking News startup, and [The *Seattle Globalist*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/12/15/sarah-glidden-gets-animated-for-the-seattle-globalist/), a nonprofit news site, is working to raise money from subscribers after the University of Washington announced it would no longer fund the site. Northwest Cable News is scheduled to go dark at the end of this week.

Sponsor Northwest Associated Arts is bringing David Sedaris to the Broadway Performance Hall for eight performances over seven days. This is astonishing on its own, but even better? Sedaris will be workshopping his new novel _Theft by Finding_ — this is your chance to see inside his creative process.
There&rsquo;s more information on our sponsor&rsquo;s page, or you can buy tickets — we suggest you grab some before all the performances are sold out, as of this writing, half the dates already are.

          A free Brooklyn-based comics newspaper called Smoke Signal — the same magazine that partially inspired Seattle&rsquo;s late, lamented Intruder comics paper — is publishing a special anti-Trump comics paper called Resist! Published in time for Inauguration Day and with a print run of over 30,000 copies, Resist! ought to make a splash as one of the first artistic protests of President Trump. Resist! is edited by Raw co-founder Françoise Mouly and Nadja Spiegelman, and it seeks to publish (mostly women-produced) comics &ldquo;on the theme of political resistance to the forces of intolerance.
