          Over at The Inlander, I wrote a piece about Seattle memoirist Elissa Washuta, who&rsquo;ll be reading at Get Lit!, Spokane&rsquo;s wonderful annual book festival. We talked about the distinction of being a memoirist versus being an essayist, whether people got mad at Washuta for the way they were presented in her memoir, and what the most surprising thing about publishing a memoir. I love introducing Seattle&rsquo;s authors to new audiences; I hope you&rsquo;ll go take a look at the piece.

I ride the new Link light rail from Husky Stadium to Pioneer Square (it&rsquo;s pretty great). I&rsquo;ve seen this same girl on the train nearly every day, our schedules are so close.

          As we&rsquo;ve mentioned, tonight is the very last Cheap Wine &amp; Poetry event at the Hugo House. This is our pick for the best event of the evening; CW&amp;P is a consistently great event, and this is its last time on the Hugo House stage before the House is demolished later this year. Further, the future of CW&amp;P — and the answer to the question of whether CW&amp;P even has a future — has not yet been announced.

        <div class="content">
          The first issue of Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreeze’s Black Panther was published yesterday, and it was one of those rare moments — like the time DC Comics killed Superman, back in the 1990s — when people who never go to comic book stores suddenly care about a single issue of a comic 1. The staff at Phoenix Comics yesterday estimated that they’d be sold out of all five dozen copies of the comic on their shelves by the end of the day.

          The debut party for Lesley Hazleton&rsquo;s Agnostic: A Spirited Manifesto last night at Town Hall was a fantastic experience. Hazleton delivered a talk that was part-extemporaneous/part-reading. Hazleton asked the audience to imagine that she held the sun in her hand, that it was about the size of an orange; the Earth, she said, would be a grain of salt circling her hand at 30 feet. The nearest star to our sun would be another orange, approximately in Big Sur.
