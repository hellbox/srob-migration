*Love a little, die a little, and break the law. Trey Milligan did them all in one summer, and before his 14th birthday.* Sponsor Frank Murtaugh's debut novel, *Trey's Company*, was just released this month, and we've got a sneak peek to share with our readers — [the intro and whole first chapter](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) – perfect timing for your summer reading list. Baseball and coming of age are a common pairing; with his background in sports writing and intimate knowledge of the story's locale, Murtaugh brings something special to the mix.

          Hey, Seattle writers! Please remember to apply for the LaSalle Storyteller Award, a fantastic $10,000 award from Artist Trust that goes to &ldquo;an individual literary artist working in fiction.&rdquo; This is a lot of cash with very few strings attached, so it&rsquo;s one of the finer fiction prizes in the region. More information at Artist Trust&rsquo;s site.
 And if you&rsquo;d like to take a writing class this summer, you should know that today is the last day for early bird pricing for any of the Hugo House&rsquo;s summer class schedule.

        <div class="content">
          WSU Press just published the first book by Bellingham-based historian Candace Wellman. The full title gives you an idea of the topic: _Peace Weavers: Uniting the Salish Coast Through Cross-Cultural Marriages_. It's a book that follows the life stories of four indigenous women who married across cultural lines, making families with pioneer men.
While the fact of cross-cultural marriages was well known, the women in them were ignored, seen as appendages of the men, or cast in racial and gender stereotypes.

San Francisco Is Burning This one&#8217;s already causing a little online consternation (what doesn&#8217;t, these days?): Jon Ronson investigates whether a rash of fires in San Francisco&#8217;s Mission District could be arson, intended to drive out lower-income residents and make way for SF&#8217;s version of the epically sky-blocking tech towers that are springing up all over Seattle.

Now that Daniel Day Lewis has announced that he’s retiring from acting, Cate Blanchett is my pick for greatest working actor in the world today. Everything about a Blanchett performance is hypnotic — it feels as though she’s simultaneously giving everything away to the audience while still holding on to something secret, deep at the core of herself. Any film with her in it is instantly more watchable.
If you’re the kind of person who enjoys watching performance for performance’s sake, you should definitely buy a ticket for Manifesto right now.

I&rsquo;m hard-pressed to recall a play that feels more timely than Book-It Repertory Theatre&rsquo;s adaptation of T. Geronimo Johnson&rsquo;s novel Welcome to Braggsville. This play is taking America&rsquo;s temperature at this very second, touching on the so-called political correctness culture of college campuses, America&rsquo;s institutional racism, Southern idolatry of Confederate culture, social media obsession, and much more. Though the book was published in 2015 and the play has been in the works for well over a year, this staging is an incredibly accurate portrait of America in the summer of 2017.

Dear Cienna,
A friend loaned me a book. I wasn’t really into reading it — it was kind of a self-help-y thing. I only took it from her because it was easier than refusing.

Today would have been Octavia Butler&rsquo;s 70th birthday. Butler is considered one of the most influential and important Science Fiction writers of the late 20th century. She came up through the Clarion Workshop, where there is now a scholarship in her honor to support writers of color.
