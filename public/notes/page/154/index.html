**Dear Cienna,**
**My granddad died in the spring. He left me all of his books. The gesture meant a lot to me. He used to read to me when I was a baby, and I remember spending hours in his study when I was a kid, flipping through his books.

        <div class="content">
          Shelf Awareness, which broke the news about Amazon Books, continues to raise questions about the brick-and-mortar outpost of Amazon.com:
Is Amazon Books getting its stock from Amazon.com, which gets extra terms unavailable to most bricks-and-mortar retailers? Are books being bought non-returnable by Amazon.com but being returned by Amazon Books to Amazon.com? How, if at all, is a distinction made between the two businesses--and how will that be handled at meetings in which the bookstore buyers participate?

        <div class="content">
          Last week, I contracted norovirus. It was terrible, and I’m not going to tell you any more about it except to say that I wound up in bed for 36 hours, feeling awful. I couldn’t watch movies. I couldn’t read poetry or prose. All I could stand to read, all I could focus my attention on for more than a minute at a time, was comic books. This has pretty much always been true for me; whenever I come down with an illness bad enough to send me to bed, I wind up reading comics.

          Secret Garden Books owner Christy McDanold has a lot of favorite books going at any one time. When I asked her to name one choice for a holiday recommendation, she seems proud to have narrowed it down to just two.
![](/webhook-uploads/1450135132044/617PGb7J6aL._SX361_BO1%2C204%2C203%2C200_.jpg)
Her first choice is [*Maps*, an “artful, rich atlas of the world” hand-drawn by Aleksandra and Daniel Mizielinska](http://www.secretgardenbooks.com/book/9780763668969), a Polish couple who are best-known for their popular typefaces. McDanold can’t stop gushing over *Maps*, calling the book “clever and creative,” and a gorgeous gift idea for “anyone who loves maps.

          We&rsquo;ve done our best to avoid Star Wars mania here on the Seattle Review of Books, but even we can&rsquo;t ignore this J.G. Ballard review of the original movie from 1977. He calls the film &ldquo;totally unoriginal, feebly plotted, instantly forgettable, and an acoustic nightmare.&rdquo; At least one of those descriptions has been proven wrong by the march of time. But the rest of Ballard&rsquo;s argument, that science fiction is a serious literary trend and that Star Wars is not a fair representation of good science fiction, is an interesting one.

          Congratulations to Seattle poet Storme Webber for winning a Frye Art Museum | Artist Trust Consortium 2015 James W. Ray Award. That $15,000 prize will undoubtedly go toward the creation of some exciting new writing that Webber will share in one of her many readings around town. That’s exactly what an award like this is for; it provides income to pillars of the community who work in fields (like, say, poetry) that don’t pay very well.

We have two expcerpts from this short, sharply told book on our sponsors page. How wonderful to have a local author, published by a local press, as a sponsor this week.
