          For Interview magazine, Choire Sicha interviewed Ursula K. Le Guin, and it&rsquo;s exactly as delightful as you hope it would be. They discuss editing, the book business, fans, and her big problem with poets. (&ldquo;Poets get very territorial, and that&rsquo;s too bad; that&rsquo;s a waste of time.&rdquo;)

          You already know that the Short Run small press &amp; comix expo is happening on Halloween this year. But they&rsquo;ve just announced their schedule for the month of October, and there&rsquo;s some great stuff happening in the lead-in to the festival. First up, on October 8th, Short Run goes to the Capitol Hill artwalk with an art show at Joe Bar featuring comics artists from Seattle, LA, Chicago, and Toronto. On the 28th, they&rsquo;ll be hosting special festival guests Charles Forsman and Melissa Mendes at the Capitol Hill branch of the library.

When we announced that we’d like to interview authors who are leaving town for our [Exit Interview](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/exit-interview-talking-with-kate-lebo-about-why-she-left-seattle-for-spokane/) feature, the most-suggested writer was [Kelly Davio](http://kellydavio.com/), a poet, columnist for The Butter, and co-publisher and poetry editor at the [*Tahoma Literary Review*](http://www.tahomaliteraryreview.com/). The e-mails we received were dripping with sadness about Davio’s departure; the word “irreplaceable” came up. Davio’s debut poetry collection, [*Burn This House*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781597092364) was publshed by Red Hen Press in 2013.

          This is terrible news. National Geographic was a nonprofit for over 125 years. Now it&rsquo;s likely going to become just another content farm for Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s multinational entertainment corporation. It&rsquo;s very hard to find a silver lining in this deal.

          You can’t stay in business for as long as (our September Bookstore of the Month) Seattle Mystery Bookshop has without becoming really, really good at a thing or two. The most readily apparent sign of the bookstore’s excellence is in its selection, which I wrote about last week. The selection is really quite impressive — the shelves of Seattle Mystery Bookshop display a stock that is comprehensive enough to please the most deeply OCD mystery nerd and yet welcoming enough to appeal to a novice browser who has never before considered reading a mystery novel.

          Of all the think-pieces published yesterday about Sherman Alexie and the Best American Poetry controversy, Jia Tolentino&rsquo;s piece at Jezebel is by far the best. Don&rsquo;t bother with the rest of them. This has been a think-piece public service announcement.

        <div class="content">
          You should absolutely read Noah Davis&rsquo;s overview of what it means to be a freelance writer in 2015.
Many newer outlets offer upwards of fifty cents per word or more—sites like The Verge might pay a dollar per word—as do established publications including *New York*'s blog network and *The Guardian*. “You can expect that two hundred and fifty dollars is an ultimate baseline for anything that you do,” Kyle Chayka, a New York-based freelancer, told me.

          A rogue wave of old grief capsized me at the bar.
The night in my mouth had the names all wrong:
Herodotus. Herodotus.
My chair was upside down
but I was making it look casual.
Earlier, when my glasses flew off and his glasses flew off
and they did a little orbit around each other
before returning to our faces—
but that was before Herodotus.
Herodotus tells us:
Human happiness never continues long in one stay.

        <div class="content">
          On the Best American Poetry blog, Sherman Alexie explains the process of guest-editing Best American Poetry 2015. He also addresses a controversy that&rsquo;s swirling around the book:
I chose a strange and funny and rueful poem written by Yi-Fen Chou, which turns out to be a Chinese pseudonym used by a white male poet named Michael Derrick Hudson as a means of subverting what he believes to be a politically correct poetry business.
