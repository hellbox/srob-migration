        <div class="content">
          Sponsor Paul Vidich&rsquo;s An Honorable Man has been getting a great reception. It&rsquo;s Washington D.C., 1953, and any fan of spy novels knows that this time is pivotal in the espionage game. Russia in chaos after Stalin died, McCarthyism taking root at home, the Cold War starting its long tense march.
We&rsquo;ve got a full chapter on our sponsor&rsquo;s page for you to read and see what you think. An Honorable Man is the perfect Father&rsquo;s Day book, a taut thriller set in an important American past.

        <div class="content">
          Gene Balk, the Seattle Times&rsquo;s excellent &ldquo;FYI Guy,&rdquo; reported over the weekend that &ldquo;Between 2011 and 2014, branch visits to Seattle Public Library declined by about 150,000 – even as branch hours were added.&rdquo; Visits are especially down in the city&rsquo;s lowest-income neighborhoods, for unclear reasons. Circulation of digital materials, however, is way up.
Could the lack of visits have to do with SPL leadership&rsquo;s &ldquo;anti-book&rdquo; agenda? Considering that many of Seattle&rsquo;s independent booksellers saw record sales during the same years that SPL&rsquo;s visits declined, an anti-book agenda probably isn&rsquo;t helping matters.

Eric McDaniel has never before been responsible for managing an entire bookstore. Before he took the lead position at the new Third Place Books Seward Park, he worked as one of a handful of managers at Third Place’s Lake Forest Park store, and he spent two years at Half Price Books on Capitol Hill. All told, he’s worked in bookstores for a dozen years.
And he’s been involved with Seward Park since the very beginning.

          Cities Like Seattle Are Recklessly Unprepared For Self-Driving Cars New Seattle-based publidation Scout takes on the infrastructure of self-driving cars. It asks a vital question: in the modern days of rapid technological change, how can the traditionally slow process of civic change catch up to technology and ideas that will benefit the city?
 Timelines for the arrival of consumer-ready self driving cars range from two to 20 years. Even if 20 years go by before Americans trade in their driver’s licenses, the fact that only one out of every 17 cities is even thinking about self-driving cars is shocking.

        <div class="content">
          Whenever I read a glowing blurb on a book these days, I wonder to myself, &ldquo;what is this person&rsquo;s relationship to the author?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s no secret that authors write blurbs for friends, or former students, or authors who have previously blurbed them. Every blurb comes with a price — a favor owed, a favor repaid. A bookseller once told me that the only blurber they trusted was Thomas Pynchon, because Pynchon was a recluse and therefore he only blurbed books that he honestly liked because he didn&rsquo;t carry the personal baggage that every other author did when it comes to blurbs.

          Seattle author Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s Seveneves will be adapted into a film by writer Bill Broyles, director Ron Howard and producer Brian Grazer — the same team that made Apollo 13, Deadline reports. Based on Martin McClellan&rsquo;s review of Seveneves, they have a lot of good stuff to work with.
 Author Kate Messner wrote a kid&rsquo;s book about addiction. Apparently, this is a controversial-enough topic that a school cancelled Messner&rsquo;s planned visit:
