        <div class="content">
          Oh, hey — here&rsquo;s a terrible idea:
To that end, [Barnes & Noble Chief Executive Ron] Boire is leading a push to rebrand Barnes & Noble as more than just a bookstore by expanding its offerings of toys, games, gadgets and other gifts and reshaping the nation’s largest bookstore chain into a “lifestyle brand.” You might argue that Barnes &amp; Noble won&rsquo;t be able to survive by just selling books. I would refute your argument by pointing out that Barnes &amp; Noble stores are already stuffed to the rafters with cheap plastic crap.

          Now is the time to apply for the Clarion West summer workshop. Yes, it does cost money to apply (though it costs less to apply now than it will cost later on) but Clarion West is maybe the best education organization in America for aspiring sci-fi and fantasy writers. And their mission statement is so goddamned good:
Speculative fiction — science fiction, fantasy, horror, magic realism, and slipstream — gives voice to those who explore societal and technological change, along with deeper considerations of underlying archetypes of human experience.

        <div class="content">
          Even if you made 50,000 words and finished NaNoWriMo, your novel isn&rsquo;t finished yet. You knew this already, right? You know what the haters say: that NaNoWriMo unleashes thousands of terrible novels into the world. It&rsquo;s as if some evil force were holding those poor people captive, forcing them to read every cliched phrase that comes in front of their eyeballs. It&rsquo;s as if they have no taste.
But, of course, the little secret of NaNoWriMo is that it doesn&rsquo;t unleash terrible novels into the world.

        <div class="content">
          We&rsquo;re generally in favor of awards here at the Seattle Review of Books. We don&rsquo;t put too much truck in them — awards are not the end of a certain type of literary conversation; they&rsquo;re the beginning. But (as long as they don&rsquo;t overly favor straight white men) awards are fun, and it&rsquo;s nice to publicly recognize the hard work that goes into the writing of books.
There&rsquo;s one award we don&rsquo;t much like, though.

Today is the birthday of Ellen Swallow Richards. She was an American chemist and author, the founder of the Home Economics movement, the first American woman to earn a degree in chemistry, the first woman admitted to MIT, and the first woman to teach at MIT.

          We&rsquo;re big fans of Seattle poet EJ Koh, and we think you should be big fans of EJ Koh, too. If you need an introduction, you should read this interview with Koh published in Hoctok. I especially like that the interview is broken up with Koh&rsquo;s poetry; it&rsquo;s surprising that more literary interview outlets don&rsquo;t liberally intersperse their interviews with actual examples of the writers&rsquo; work. Seeing an author&rsquo;s thoughts and words in such close proximity to each other provides a more immersive experience for the reader.

          Every once in a while, a truly individual voice will emerge out of the morass of conventional superhero comics. These occasions are always a surprise — nobody could have predicted that Swamp Thing would become a convergence point between art and commercial comics until Alan Moore and Steve Bissette landed on the book, and nobody expected much of Daredevil until Frank Miller was allowed to get experimental with the character. It’s too early to draw a comparison Tom King and Gabriel Hernandez Walta’s The Vision to those two examples, but two issues into the series, it’s already clear that the book is something special.

          Teju Cole published a poem at the New Inquiry in response to today&rsquo;s terrible news out of San Bernardino. It&rsquo;s a moving reminder that poetry can respond to current events, can be as timely as a thinkpiece, can be so much more meaningful than a hot take on Twitter.

 A signed copy of Seattle cartoonist Colleen Frakes&rsquo;s memoir Prison Island, along with a piece of original art. (Read my review of Prison Island here.)
 A watercolor painting by newly local cartoonist Sarah Glidden.
 An original portrait from Seattle cartoonist Kelly Froh.

          At 2 pm, Bainbridge Island author Jonathan Evison, author of novels like This Is Your Life, Harriet Chance! and the excellent The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving will be doing an Ask Me Anything on Reddit. Follow this link and, well, ask Evison anything. In my experience, he&rsquo;s always been remarkably open in interviews, from the business side of things to what he thinks of other writers. I can pretty much guarantee he&rsquo;ll be painfully honest, which makes this an interesting opportunity for those burning questions you&rsquo;ve always wanted to drop on a novelist.
