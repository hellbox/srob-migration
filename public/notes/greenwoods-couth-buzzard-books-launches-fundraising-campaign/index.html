<p>Citing decreasing retail book sales, rising rents, and other increased expenditures, Greenwood community bookshop Couth Buzzard Books <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/FriendsOfCouthBuzzardBooks">launched a GoFundMe campaign this morning</a>. The campaign aims to raise $9,500 dollars through the sale of a number of rewards, including locally produced art, music, and books. Additionally, funders who provide up to $100 in support will receive an equal amount in store credit to spend on books at the shop.</p>

<blockquote>We are confident in and excited about our future because of our broader, community focus. More importantly, we believe in the diverse communities who continue to keep The Buzzard flourishing: thank you for helping to create what makes Couth Buzzard so special to us and to others. For many, our store is a second home, and we want to keep our space open to all, our events no- or low-cost, for many more years to come. To achieve this, we are asking for your financial support in order to continue serving this community.</blockquote>
