<li>Seattle author G. Willow Wilson <a href="http://gwillowwilson.com/post/167200260578/the-bird-king-takes-flight-with-groveatlantic">just announced her second novel</a>:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>My second novel, *The Bird King*, has been sold to Grove/Atlantic. You’ll be hearing a lot more about it from me in the coming months, so for now I’ll just say this: it’s set in 15th century Spain and those of you who’ve been pining for more genies ought to be pleased.</blockquote>

<li><p>This is pretty cool: <a href="https://hugohouse.org/poetry-across-the-nations-supports-native-poets/">Hugo House and the Poetry Foundation are joining forces with poet Natalie Diaz to put on a series called</a> &ldquo;Poetry Across the Nations, a new community outreach program facilitated by Native women, on December 6–8.&rdquo; The series will eventually move to South Dakota and Arizona, but it starts here first. Events include poetry workshops for the Squamish community and indigenous writers, as well as a reading of indigenous writers at FRED Wildlife Refuge on Thursday, December 7th. We&rsquo;ll have more information about the series in the coming weeks.</p></li>
