Mountain Goats lead singer John Darnielle’s debut novel, *Wolf in White Van*, was an incredibly affecting story of a wounded soul trying to come to terms with society. Darnielle’s second novel is about a video store clerk in 1990s Iowa who discovers a bizarre secret hidden on the films in his store.
