<p>Sponsor Isla McKetta spent a year in Poland, and it was that experience, and having spent a previous year in Pinochet&rsquo;s Chile as a child, that made oppression a topic in the forefront of her mind. In her novel <em>Polska, 1994</em> she explores that, through the eyes of Magda, who witnesses her mother&rsquo;s arrest and disapearance.</p>
