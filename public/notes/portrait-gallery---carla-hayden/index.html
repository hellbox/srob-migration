<p>Carla Hayden is the 14th Librarian of Congress! But, more importantly, she&rsquo;s the first female and first black Librarian of Congress &mdash; the thirteen before her have all been white men. Also, she&rsquo;s actually a librarian (with a doctorate in library science from U Chicago), which hasn&rsquo;t been the case since the 70s.
