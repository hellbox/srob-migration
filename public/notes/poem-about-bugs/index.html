<p>Let’s begin with bark beetles, sugar pines and sap. I am twelve,<br>
and as high as I can get in the tree behind our double-wide<br>
mobile home. I’m peeling bark back by my bare hands</p>

<p>to see bug tracks, small iris-like engravements canyoned<br>
into the tree’s meat like a secret message or a promise<br>
from the maker of trees: <em>Your eye will not purple</em></p>

<p><em>like your mother’s</em>. Her cries are faint from this lofty height &mdash;<br>
breezy, though more shrill than moan. My aunt has a soft whine<br>
when she’s dragged by her hair down a hallway. I don’t cry</p>

<p>for her or for my mother. I’m too scaly to know<br>
that the tree’s diseased, that these gnawings are evidence.</p>
