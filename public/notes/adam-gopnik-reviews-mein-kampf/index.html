<p>Now that <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/13/its-a-hitler/"><em>Mein Kampf</em> is back in the headlines</a> — thanks a lot, Germany — Adam Gopnik <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/does-mein-kampf-remain-a-dangerous-book">reviews the book for <em>The New Yorker</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote>...the striking thing about the text as a text is that it is not so much diabolical or sinister as *creepy*. It is the last book in the world that you would expect a nascent Fascist dictator to write... Hitler, whom we suspect of being an embittered, envious, traumatized loser, presents himself as . . . an embittered, envious, traumatized loser.</blockquote>

<p>This is a very good book review and you should <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/does-mein-kampf-remain-a-dangerous-book">read the whole thing</a>.</p>
