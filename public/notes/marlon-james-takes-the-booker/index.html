<p>Great news! Jamaican novelist Marlon James has won the booker for <em>A Brief History of Seven Killings</em>. Everybody I know who has read this book has done nothing but rave about it, and as this linked BBC article says: “The judges had come to a unanimous decision in less than two hours.”</p>

<p>Congratulations to James. If you’d like to know more about him — and his winning book — Jess Walter and Sherman Alexie recently <a href="http://www.infiniteguest.org/tiny-sense/2015/04/marlon-james-audio-book/">talked to him on their podcast <em>A Tiny Sense of Accomplishment</em></a>.</p>
