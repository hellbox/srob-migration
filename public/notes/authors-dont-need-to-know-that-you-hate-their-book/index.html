<p>At <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/may/22/when-tweeters-attack-why-do-readers-send-authors-their-bad-reviews?CMP=share_btn_tw"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, Danuta Kean wrote a very good post about people who feel compelled to tag writers on social media with their very negative book reviews:</p>

<blockquote>Others seem genuinely to think they are helping the writer by telling them they hated their latest work. All seem blissfully unaware that as a far as the author is concerned, their feedback is unwanted. Their tweet or post is on a level with a stranger shouting abuse in the street.</blockquote>

<p>Remember: authors are humans, too. Maybe don&rsquo;t make them feel like shit unless it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary? This isn&rsquo;t to say that you should skip writing negative reviews. You just don&rsquo;t need to wrap your negative review up in a bow and then drop it in an author&rsquo;s lap.</p>
