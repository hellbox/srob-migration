<p>Independent booksellers and librarians made Jeannette Walls&rsquo;s 2005 coming-of-age memoir <em>The Glass Castle</em> into a global bestseller. While <em>Castle</em> was obviously well-written and funny and heartbreaking, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine the book breaking through into the mainstream without the passionate support of librarians and booksellers who understood the value of a meaningful coming-of-age story.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.theglasscastle.movie/">film adaptation of <em>Glass Castle</em> (starring Brie Larson, Woody Harrelson, and Naomi Watts) is coming out on Friday, August 11th</a>, and because the literary community made the book such a huge success, the good folks at film PR firm Allied Integrated Marketing wanted to make sure that bookish folks got to see it first. So we&rsquo;re partnering with them to give away some free VIP ticket prize packs to the Seattle premiere of <em>Glass Castle</em>, which screens next Tuesday evening at Pacific Place.</p>
