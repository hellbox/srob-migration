<p><em>SRoB</em> tipper <a href="https://twitter.com/Nick_Hanover/status/649818773860388864">Nick Hanover</a> alerted me to <a href="http://graphicpolicy.com/2015/10/01/enough-is-enough-dark-horses-scott-allies-assaulting-behavior/">this excellent Graphic Policy story by Janelle Asselin</a> about former Dark Horse Comics editor-in-chief Scott Allie, alleging that Allie frequently engaged in &ldquo;out of control behavior while drunk and biting.&rdquo; Yes, biting. As in, his nickname around the office was supposedly &ldquo;<strong>Bitey the Clown</strong>.&rdquo; Allie was removed from his job this fall after he publicly assaulted two people at a convention, but rumor has it that Dark Horse Comics in specific, and the Portland comics scene in general, has been covering up for Allie for years. (And in fact, Allie <strong>still works at Dark Horse</strong>, under the title &ldquo;executive senior editor.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>As Graphic Policy notes, there&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/harassment-in-comics-investigation/">a long history of harassment and sexual assault in the comics industry</a>, and professionals have demonstrated a willingness to cover up for decades&rsquo; worth of bad behavior. The silence is <a href="http://comicsalliance.com/sexual-harassment-women-comics-games-fear-way-of-life/">starting to break</a>, but that bad behavior is still <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/16/calling-out-the-comic-book-super-villains/">everywhere in the industry</a>.</p>

<p>If you have experienced sexual harassment in the comics industry, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/">we want to hear your story</a>. It&rsquo;s bad enough that this behavior is considered typical in comics; it&rsquo;s downright disgusting to think that the Pacific Northwest has been home to this culture of silence for decades.</p>
