<p>In advance of tonight&rsquo;s <a href="https://townhallseattle.org/event/journalismsowhite/">#JournalismSoWhite</a> event at Town Hall, we wanted to recall our own diversity reports, written by our Public Diversity Editor, Vanessa Willoughby.</p>

<p>We published <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/09/07/public-diversity-editor-report-1-september-2016/">Vanessa&rsquo;s first report on September 7th of this year</a>. We think her observations and analysis of our work on this issue were right on-point.</p>

<p>As she pointed out: &ldquo;Whether it be diverse representation in film or a diverse workplace, sometimes diversity doesn’t necessarily mean equality. A company could mistakenly believe that they’re diverse because they have a few people of color in an otherwise very white staff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The day after we published her piece, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/09/08/our-response-to-the-public-diversity-editor-report-1-september-2016/">we responded</a>. Vanessa has agreed to come back at regular intervals and gauge our growth on these important issues.</p>

<p>We call on all publications to take the simple step we did — let an outside auditor evaluate your diversity, so that any tallies or calculations are free of your own internal biases. We&rsquo;d love to see a media landscape where publications are held to task for the important work of inclusivity.</p>
