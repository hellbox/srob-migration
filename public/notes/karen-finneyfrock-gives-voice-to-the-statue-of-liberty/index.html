<p>Well, it&rsquo;s been another banner week in the history of our great republic. The democratic process has never seemed so&hellip;well, uh. Yeah.</p>

<p>Maybe the appropriate way to close out your workweek, then, is to <a href="http://kuow.org/post/what-would-statue-liberty-have-say-about-immigration-today">listen to KUOW&rsquo;s Elizabeth Austen and Marcie Sillman introduce Karen Finneyfrock&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;The Newer Colossus,&rdquo;</a> which is written from the perspective of the Statue of Liberty. Finneyfrock&rsquo;s version of Liberty is weary. She&rsquo;s seen too many anti-immigration hypocrites, from her island. &ldquo;Quit your silly shit,&rdquo; she&rsquo;s basically telling us.</p>

<p>Hopefully, we&rsquo;ll listen.</p>
