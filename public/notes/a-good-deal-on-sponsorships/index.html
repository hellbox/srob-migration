<p>We&rsquo;ve got two open sponsorships in March we&rsquo;d love to get into your hands. We&rsquo;ve discounted them â€” $50 off for next week, March 6 - March 12, and $25 off for the week after, March 13 - March 19. <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">Grab &lsquo;em quick</a>!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re also in super-secret testing with some new sponsorship types. Besides events and books, we&rsquo;d love to promote opportunities for writers (contests, call-for-entries, retreats, and anything else), and charitable giving. If you&rsquo;d like to try either of those, we&rsquo;d love to hear from you. <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">These discounted weeks</a> might be a good low-risk way to try us out. <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/">Send us an email</a> if you have any questions or want to talk more.</p>
