<blockquote>Opening this September is the Book and Bed, a new hotel located in Tokyo’s Ikebukuro neighborhood, that, according to Rocket News 24, literally “invites bibliophiles to sleep in the stacks.”</blockquote>

<p>They can&rsquo;t promise privacy, but they can promise the opportunity to fall asleep while doing something you love. This is not your only opportunity to sleep in a bookstore: Abrams writes, &ldquo;In Paris, if you’re <a href="http://shakespeareandcompany.com/51/shakespeare-and-company/55/volunteering-with-us">willing to volunteer time</a>, you can crash at Shakespeare &amp; Co.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s two ways to really make yourself at home in bookstores. Really, it&rsquo;s kind of surprising a bookstore bed &amp; breakfast hasn&rsquo;t opened in Seattle yet, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
