<p>If you&rsquo;re upset about Tuesday&rsquo;s election results leaning very conservative across the country, you really ought to go to Town Hall tonight. Ari Berman, who was kind enough to <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/03/voting-is-power-a-conversation-with-ari-berman-about-the-struggle-for-voting-rights-in-america/">do an Election Day interview with us</a>, will read from <em>Give Us the Ballot</em>, his compelling history of the struggle for voting rights in America. Berman will also be in conversation with Washington state Supreme Court Justice Steven Gonzalez about local results and what we can do to increase voter turnout here. This is a huge issue, and it&rsquo;s not going to go away by itself. Berman&rsquo;s meticiulous research provides him with a unique perspective on how we can solve America&rsquo;s growing democracy problem.</p>
