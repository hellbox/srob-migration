<p>Today is the birthday of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Swallow_Richards" title="Ellen Swallow Richards - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Ellen Swallow Richards</a>. She was an American chemist and author, the founder of the Home Economics movement, the first American woman to earn a degree in chemistry, the first woman admitted to MIT, and the first woman to teach at MIT.</p>

<p>She was a feminist (some say the first eco-feminist), and was an environmental scientist who studied air quality, groundwater, soil, and food. She authored books about science for use in the home, particularly about nutrition and sanitation, bringing a scientific rigor to what once was the realm of hand-me-down tales.</p>
