Wondering what to read with your late lunch this Monday afternoon? Try a chapter from sponsor Joe Ponepinto&rsquo;s <em>Mr. Neutron</em> — a political, science-fictional satire starring a down-and-out political flunky and a cadaverous (in the best way) mayoral candidate in small-town Grand River.</p>

<p>Ponepinto is known to many of you as the founding publisher and fiction editor of the <a href="https://tahomaliteraryreview.com/"><em>Tahoma Literary Review</em></a>. We&rsquo;re honored to have him as a sponsor and delighted to suggest his lastest to you.</p>

<p>Sponsors like Joe Ponepinto make the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> possible. Did you know <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/">you could sponsor us, as well</a>? If you have a book, event, or opportunity you’d like to get in front of our readers, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">reserve your dates now</a>.</p>
