<p>There is a part of me that doesn’t understand longing.<br>
And yet, with my hands full of daisies, forget-me-nots,</p>

<p>I walk into a field of wildflowers and ask for more.<br>
This is how I feel when you touch my shoulder.</p>

<p>There are nights of only so much moonshine<br>
and I want to bathe in more than my share.</p>

<p><em>Saltwater</em>, you’ve said. <em>The oceans calms</em>. Sometimes<br>
I lose myself and want to go under. Part mermaid.</p>

<p>Part riptide. There was a time when every beach<br>
was a room I would undress in. Now, I forget to live</p>

<p>that openly. Now, I hold back what I want to say.<br>
There’s a belief we each have to live flawlessly.</p>

<p>I rip off the roots of flowers and place them in a vase.<br>
Forget the fields where you could kiss me hard</p>

<p>and instead, call the florist, close the door.<br>
Because we can’t say what we want, we write</p>

<p>a confessional poem where every sentence is true,<br>
except one. Tell me again how often you think about me.</p>

<p>Tell me again how the drowning man finds himself<br>
dreaming how one day walk he’ll walk on land.</p>
