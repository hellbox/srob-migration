<p>Right now, the internet is exploding with spoilers from <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/25/11769542/captain-america-marvel-comics-hydra-supervillain">Marvel</a> and <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/every-major-revelation-in-dc-comics-rebirth-special-1778505653">DC Comics</a>. Which is weird. People seem to be getting genuinely upset over some of these plot twists, and they don&rsquo;t seem to understand that this kind of media feeding frenzy has been going on since at least the late 90s, when Superman died for the first time. Look, it&rsquo;s great to see people get excited about comics — I <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/thursday-comics-hangover/">write a column about comics every week</a> — but we don&rsquo;t need to <a href="https://twitter.com/nickspencer/status/735466503303233536">harangue creators</a> or write very long thinkpieces in response to what is obviously a plot twist in an ongoing story. Corporate superhero comics are all about the illusion of change. Everything will be okay, I promise.</p>
