<p class="noindent">Sponsor [Lori Tsugawa Whaley](http://loriwhaley.com), a third-generation Japanese American, was raised in a primarily Caucasian community and felt disconnected from her Japanese heritage. While exploring this ancient culture, she discovered a source of truth — the code of ethics known as *bushido*. Bushido means “the way of the warrior”; it is the set of chivalrous principles that governed the behavior of the ancient Japanese warriors known as samurai.</p>

<p>Lori Tsugawa Whaley brings these concepts to everyday life, showing through examples the kind of ethical and moral choices you can make when guided by principles. As she says, &ldquo;I believe you were born to live a life of courage, honor, and integrity.&rdquo; Read an <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">excerpt on our sponsor&rsquo;s page</a>.</p>
