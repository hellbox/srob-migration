<p>After a long weekend, we&rsquo;re left with too much news for one single Book News Roundup to contain!</p>

<li><p>Capitol Hill Seattle Blog <a href="http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2016/02/v2-value-village-to-become-temporary-capitol-hill-arts-space/">has the skinny on V2</a>, the new temporary arts space in the old Value Village building on Capitol Hill&rsquo;s 11th Ave. Literary tenants include Bumbershoot producer One Reel and possibly Hugo House, and the space will be broken up into &ldquo;performance areas, rental studios, classrooms, offices, and storage.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Starting on March 6th, the Henry Art Gallery will be <a href="https://henryart.org/visit/visit-the-museum">free on Sundays</a>. Don&rsquo;t think this is book-related? Piffle, I say! A few years back, the Henry hosted <a href="https://henryart.org/exhibitions/shelf-life">a brilliant exhibit about the history of indpendent publishing</a>, including a few early e-books and some very interesting publishing projects. They also host author events and publish four or five books a year.</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;I was literally 30 minutes from saving the company,&rdquo; former Borders CEO Mike Edwards says <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/index.ssf/2016/02/borders_5_years_after_bankrupt.html#incart_river_home">in Paula Gardener&rsquo;s story</a> about the death of the once-popular national bookselling chain. If this story makes you too nostalgic for Borders, please go read <a href="https://medium.com/@paulconstant/books-without-borders-b8ccb08b5b8a#.hvshvnxhk">my account of what it was like to work at Borders</a>, which will hopefully remind you that the chain had a lot of big problems that led to its eventual collapse.</p></li>
