If you like epic dark fantasy, stop reading this post and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/">go immediately to the sample chapter</a> from sponsor Allen Batchelder&rsquo;s <em>Steel, Blood &amp; Fire</em>. You&rsquo;ll find the not-so-heroic hero Tarmun Vykers sitting in the stocks, at the mercy of an entire village he&rsquo;s mysteriously offended. It&rsquo;s an irresistible opening, and so are the cameos by Aoife, a woman on a secret and possibly deadly mission, and Long Pete, a man whose destiny (at least for today) lies at the bottom of a flask. The first book in a series called Immortal Treachery, <em>Steel, Blood &amp; Fire</em> is a fast-paced and gripping story, and we&rsquo;re delighted to share a taste with our readers.</p>
