<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">_[Upside Down: Inverted Tropes in Storytelling Anthology](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/apexpublications/upside-down-inverted-tropes-in-storytelling-anthol)_. We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Apex Publications](http://www.apexbookcompany.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>Upside Down is a collection of short fiction. Each story examines a tired trope or common cliche and twists it into something new!</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    What a fun project. Short fiction that takes a trope &mdash; Prostitute with a Heart of Gold; the City Planet; The Singularity Will Cause the Apocalypse; Heroine Loves a Bad Man; The Magical Negro, just to name a few &mdash; and flips it in some way. 
</p>

<p>The editors leave it up to the author to decide how to destroy the trope they chose, so no doubt there will be a lot of imaginative upending of some hoary old cliches.</p>

<p>Plus the production values look great &mdash; nice artwork, nice video, nice presentation.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">A ton of reasons, but here's a good one: Seattle's own Nisi Shawl is included.</p>

<p>Plus it&rsquo;s cheap! Get the ebook for $5, or the softbound print copy for $15.</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">28 days to go, and they're 45% funded. It's a good bet they'll make it.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
