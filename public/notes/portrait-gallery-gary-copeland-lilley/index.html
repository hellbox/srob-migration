**Friday May 26th: Lashley/Lilley**</p>

You might not know poet Gary Copeland Lilley, a Cave Canem fellow whose latest book is *The Bushman’s Medicine Show*. Together, the two of them are a bicoastal poetry assassin squad.<br />*Open Books, 2414 N. 45th St., 633-0811, http://openpoetrybooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*
