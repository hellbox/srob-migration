<p>This weekend, G. Willow Wilson <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/30/g-willow-wilson-on-commercial-art-ethics-and-donald-trump/">took a public stand</a> against Marvel president Ike Perlmutter for donating $1 million to Donald Trump&rsquo;s weird pro-veteran charity thing. In her post on the controversy, Wilson made a joke about getting fired.</p>

<p>The next day, Wilson picked up an honor that definitely makes the case for her continued employment. Her <em>Ms. Marvel</em> comic won the Best Series award at the Angouleme International Comics Festival. It&rsquo;s the first Marvel comic to ever win the award. This is not the best year for the Angouleme — they&rsquo;re <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/06/fantagraphics-author-withdraws-name-from-sexist-award-long-list/">having a sexism problem</a> — but they certainly made the right call with <em>Ms. Marvel</em>. Congratulations to Wilson, who certainly had a roller coaster of a weekend.</p>
