*Slate*'s Isaac Chotiner asks Jonathan Franzen if he's ever considered writing a book about race:

<blockquote>I have thought about it, but—this is an embarrassing confession—I don’t have very many black friends. I have never been in love with a black woman. I feel like if I had, I might dare.</blockquote>

Is there a word for when self-parody becomes the self? Is Jonathan Franzen the Donald Trump of the literary world?

**UPDATE 1 pm**: This tweet seems relevant:
