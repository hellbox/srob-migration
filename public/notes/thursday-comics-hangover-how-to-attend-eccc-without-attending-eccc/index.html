<p>Emerald City Comicon has long since sold out, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t enjoy a number of (free) comics-centered celebrations around Seattle this weekend. Here are a few of the best-looking events for you to attend:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Broadway&rsquo;s <a href="http://phoenixseattle.com/emerald-city-comic-con-schedule-events/">Phoenix Comics is hosting a signing tonight from 5 to 7 pm</a> with Seattle author G. Willow Wilson and former Batgirl writer and <em>MotorCrush</em> writer/artist Babs Tarr.</p></li>

<li><p>The fantastic free comics anthology <em>Thick as Thieves</em> is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2064285317150646/">hosting &ldquo;Thievescon&rdquo; Friday night at Nii Modo on Stone Way</a>. All sorts of great local cartoonists will be in attendance including Marie Hausauer and Sarah Ramano Diehl. This looks to be a great independent Seattle-centric mini-con.</p></li>

<li><p>Also on Friday night, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/916387338486326/">Outsider Comics and Geek Boutique in Fremont</a> is hosting Seattle artist Tatiana Gill as part of their artwalk celebration.</p></li>

<li><p>Saturday afternoon and evening, Outsider Comics is hosting a signing from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/165730457558349/">cartoonist Ben Fleuter</a> and a signing from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/546307009089908/">Richard Rivera, who created something called Stabbity Bunny</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Yesterday <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2018/02/28/for-jaime-hernandez-love-and-rockets-is-everything/">I interviewed Jaime Hernandez</a>, who will be doing a special signing at a party at the Fantagraphics Bookstore and Gallery in Georgetown on Saturday night with other cartoonists including Simon Hanselmann.</p></li>

<li><p>And also on Saturday night, <a href="http://phoenixseattle.com/emerald-city-comic-con-schedule-events/">Phoenix Comics is hosting a party</a> to celebrate the podcast <em>Jay + Miles X-Plain the X-Men</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>And if you&rsquo;d rather buy comics than socialize, Comics Dungeon in Wallingford is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/202626210326420/">hosting a different sale for every day of the convention</a>. These sales, according to the Dungeon, have &ldquo;one specific goal; to try to get you to try something new!&rdquo;</p></li>
</ul>
