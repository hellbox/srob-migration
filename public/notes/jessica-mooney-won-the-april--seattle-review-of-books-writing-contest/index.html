<p>A <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/12/aprils-throwing-a-writing-contest-and-youre-invited/">couple months ago</a>, the APRIL Festival announced a writing contest, with the winner receiving $100, the publication of their piece right here on the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>, and a reading slot in the 2016 festival.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/APRILFestival/posts/1203721599657226">APRIL announced</a> that the winner of their contest is Jessica Mooney, who <a href="https://twitter.com/jessleimoon">you can follow on Twitter</a> right now. <em>SRoB</em> cofounder Martin McClellan and I chose the winning entry, and it took a lot of deliberation. The entries were all so good, but Mooney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Love Canal&rdquo; was, in the end, a unanimous favorite.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re very excited for you to read this piece of writing in the spring, and we&rsquo;re also excited to hear Mooney read it in this year&rsquo;s festival. Thanks to everyone who participated, and thanks for APRIL for asking us to take part in this contest.</p>
