Kentop will be appearing this Sunday, November 15th at 2:00pm, at the Ballard branch of the Seattle Public Library to read from this impressive work.</p>

<p>You can read <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">two poems from the book on our sponsor page</a>. We encourage you to support local poets and artists, and taking a moment to look on our sponsor page is one easy way to do that. If you like what you see, consider purchasing the book or going to Kentop&rsquo;s reading.</p>

<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in reaching an eganged audience (like yourself), who love books and want to support local works, you may be <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">interested in our Sponsorship program</a>. We have one week left in our initial block, and once that&rsquo;s gone we&rsquo;re 100% sold out. Support the work we do with news, with publishing (and paying!) local poets, as well as our book reviews. It&rsquo;s our part of our campaign to make internet advertising 100 less terrible.</p>
