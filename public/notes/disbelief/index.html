<p>Said the prayer to the dream<br>
I don&rsquo;t believe you want to hear me</p>

<p>Said the dream to paper<br>
I don&rsquo;t believe you want to hold me</p>

<p>Said the paper to the wind<br>
I don&rsquo;t believe you want to help me</p>

<p>Said the wind to the man<br>
I don&rsquo;t believe you see me</p>

<p>The man felt the wind whisper in his ear and swatted the dream <br>
that sounded like a prayer that was held by the paper</p>

<p>In one breath, the wind became an answer<br>
no one ever asked the question to</p>

<p>In one dream, the wind forgot its voice, in another dream the paper<br>
was torn before it learned how to say its own name</p>

<p>In the first dream, the prayer learned what walking through<br>
blackness feels like &mdash; it is the opposite of abandonment</p>

<p>In the last dream, all the names are written on the paper<br>
in the form of a prayer that sounds<br>
like the wind and feels like the breath<br>
of a flower across your cheek</p>
