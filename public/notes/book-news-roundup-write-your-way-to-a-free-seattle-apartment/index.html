<li><p>An anonymous Seattle apartment building owner is <a href="http://www.essayforfreeapartment.com/">running an essay contest</a>. The winner gets to live rent-free in a &ldquo;clean, comfortable place&rdquo; in Queen Anne or Ballard for a year. The essays are supposed to respond to the question &ldquo;How would a free apartment for one year help you reach your goals in 10 years?&rdquo; in 350 words or less. You can&rsquo;t solve gentrification with a writing contest, but at least the odds are better than Powerball.</p></li>

<li><p>Jeff VanderMeer&rsquo;s new short story is titled &ldquo;Jeb Bush Is Sinking,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s <a href="http://electricliterature.com/jeb-bush-is-sinking-new-fiction-from-jeff-vandermeer/">published at <em>Electric Literature</em></a>, and it&rsquo;s fantastic, especially if you&rsquo;re the sort of person who has really enjoyed watching Jeb Bush squirm over the last few months.</p></li>

<li><p>Amazon is merging its original book social media site Shelfari with its other book social media site GoodReads, and at least one Shelfari user is <a href="http://thereadersroom.org/2016/01/12/amazon-kills-shelfari/">very upset about it</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>The January issue of <em>The White Review</em> — featuring works in translation — is <a href="http://www.thewhitereview.org/online-issue/january-2016/">available online</a>. If you&rsquo;re looking for somwehwere to start, I very much enjoyed this weird and wonderful short story titled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.thewhitereview.org/fiction/dimples/">Dimples</a>.&rdquo;</p></li>
