<p class="noindent">Paul has <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/11/09/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-november-9th-november-15th/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Your Week in Readings: The best literary events from November 9th - November 15th">recommended you go see Steven Barker</a> on Thursday night at Hugo House. While I think that's a great option, I wanted to also recommend an alternative: <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/priscilla-long-0" title="PRISCILLA LONG | The Elliott Bay Book Company">Priscilla Long at the Elliott Bay Book Company</a>.</p>

<p>Long has two newly released books: <em>Minding The Muse: a Handbook for Painters, Composers, Writers, and Other Creators</em> (<a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/help-selfie/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Help selfie">reviewed today by Bonnie J Rough</a>), and <em>Fire and Stone: Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?</em>, a book of essays.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s a local poet (we <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/09/20/art-life/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Art &amp;amp; Life">ran one by her a few months ago</a>) teacher, and long-time friend to writers (<em>The Writer&rsquo;s Portable Mentor</em>, from 2010, is a particular favorite of mine). Her background exploring the history of creativity, art, and expressions of everything from joy to grief will no doubt make interesting conversation in our current climate.</p>

<p><em>Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.</em></p>
