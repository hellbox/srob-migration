<p>Our sponsor <a href="http://www.priscillalong.com" title="Home - Priscilla Long">Priscilla Long</a> is launching her new poetry collection <em>Crossing Over</em> September 19th at 7pm at Elliott Bay Books. For the next day, we&rsquo;re featuring one of her poems on our <a href="/sponsorships">sponsrship page</a>, and we hope you take a look.</p>

<p>Like all of our sponsors, Priscilla is a hard-working writer. She wants to get the word out about her upcoming event. Take a look, consider going to see her, and tell her you found out about the reading on the <em>SRoB</em>. Your consideration is the first step in our campaign to make advertising on the <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Help us make internet advertisements 100 percent less terrible">internet something we all like</a>.</p>
