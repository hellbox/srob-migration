<p>You are hopefully already <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoBillNoBreak?src=tren&amp;data_id=tweet%3A745704163443675136">watching #NoBillNoBreak</a>, the Democratic Congressional sit-in to demand a vote on gun responsibility laws. It&rsquo;s a striking bit of political drama, and a battle over one of the most important issues of our time.</p>

<p>I just wanted to remind you that Georgia Congressman John Lewis, the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/22/politics/john-lewis-sit-in-gun-violence/index.html">originator of this sit-in</a>, has been at this kind of thing for a very long time, and he is the author of an amazing autobiographical comics series called <em>The March</em> about the fight for civil rights. There are two volumes out right now â€” here&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781603093002">Volume One</a>, and here&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781603094009">Volume Two</a>. The third and final book in the series will be published <a href="http://www.comicsbeat.com/march-book-3-cover-and-pub-date-revealed/">this August</a>. If you&rsquo;re looking for inspiration, if you&rsquo;re looking to learn how to win a political fight when seemingly every force in the world is lined up against you, you should read these books.</p>
