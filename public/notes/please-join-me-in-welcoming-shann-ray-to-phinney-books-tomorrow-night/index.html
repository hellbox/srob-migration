<p>After you&rsquo;ve celebrated <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/27/event-of-the-week-independent-bookstore-day-on-saturday-april-30/">Independent Bookstore Day</a> tomorrow, I hope you&rsquo;ll <a href="http://www.phinneybooks.com/upcoming-events/2016/4/30/shann-ray-in-conversation-with-paul-constant">come out to Phinney Books</a> for a special edition of the Dock Street Salon. Spokane author <a href="http://shannray.com/about/">Shann Ray</a>, who wrote the novel <em>American Copper</em>, will read and then he and I will be in conversation. <em>Copper</em> is a novel about Montana in the early 20th century, and Ray has very interesting things to say about masculinity. He also, according to his bio, &ldquo;teaches leadership and forgiveness studies at Gonzaga University,&rdquo; which is absolutely fascinating. So if you&rsquo;re up for a conversation about forgiveness, masculinity, basketball, and maybe bookstores, I hope you&rsquo;ll show up at Phinney Books around seven. It&rsquo;s free, and usually Dock Street brings along something to drink, too.</p>
