Collins died in Los Angeles today, the cause was breast cancer. It’s hard to imagine a single person selling as many books, reportedly 500 million copies of her 32 novels, as she did. The younger sister of actor Joan Collins, she made a career of the scandalous, covering romances, dalliances, deceptions, and desire. Apparently, _Vanity Fair_ once called her “Hollywood’s own Marcel Proust”, which seems as good as a compliment as anybody could ever hope to carry.
