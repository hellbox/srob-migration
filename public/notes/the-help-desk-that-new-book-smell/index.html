<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Whenever people get angry about e-books, they always talk about how much they love the way books smell. Is this real? The only time I’ve ever smelled a book was when it was sitting in a musty basement for too long.
**</p>

<p>**I’ve always had a decent sense of smell, I thought. I can tell when I forgot to put on deodorant in the morning, and I love new car smell. But of all the pleasures that books bring me, smell is not one of them.
**</p>

<p><strong>Do books have a smell? What do they smell like?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Brian,</p>
 

<p class="noindent">What have you been doing with your life that you've only ever sniffed one book? I bet you've sniffed a handful of horrible things *repeatedly* in your life but you can't be bothered to pick up a book, close your eyes, and inhale until you run out of lung? I have three books sitting on my desk right now and each smells different: Shawn Vestal's *Daredevils* smells crisp, like socks fresh from the dryer; *Sally Ride: America's First Woman in Space* smells sour because I spilled old coffee on it; my 20-year-old copy of Flannery O'Connor's *The Complete Stories* smells like spiders in top hats because it is the book I return to the most often and thus have charged my most trusted spiders to watch over it like those somber circus-themed sentinels that guard the Vatican.
</p>
 

<p>There have been scientific <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac9016049">research papers</a> written on how the smell of books change as they age. There are posters devoted to <a href="http://www.compoundchem.com/2014/06/01/newoldbooksmell/">the aroma chemistry of them</a>. Our memory is closely tied to our sense of smell, which is why book lovers cherish the scents that emanate from their favorite works, and which is probably why whenever I smell a spider in a top hat, I now have the urge to hug a wooden-legged woman.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in seeing how books smell (har har), ask a handful of friends to bring over a favorite book and a bottle of wine. Cover the labels and blindfold yourself, and your friends can blindly drink and watch in amusement as you sniff out the unique notes of their favorite works.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>

<h5 style="color:#70AF49; font-size:32px; padding:1em 0;">BONUS QUESTION:</h5>

<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Enough about us. What have you been reading lately?**</p>

<p class="noindent">**Donna, Winslow**</p>
 

<p class="noindent">Dear Donna,</p>
 

<p class="noindent">My summer resolution is to put a dent in the Subaru-sized pile of books that have been gifted to me over the years. The last few books I've read include the above-mentioned *Daredevils* (for which I owe this fine website a book review), *Sally Ride*, *Gilead*, *The Carter Family*, and *Between the World and Me*. Currently I'm reading *A Little Life*, which is quite the depressing beach read! When I need a break, I reread an O'Connor short story because it's been long enough since my last time through *The Complete Stories* that her descriptions and humor awe and surprise me anew.</p>
 

<p>Thanks for asking!</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>

<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
