<p class="noindent">You know who we think are the best people in the world? A hint: it starts with _s_ and ends with _ponsors_. We owe a huge enthusiastic thank you to the more than sixty sponsors who've signed up to support us since we launched. By putting their projects in front of our readers, it means that we can pay writers, which is pretty dope. Also, unlike some advertising, our sponsors are pretty amazing and interesting &mdash; you actually _want_ to read what their offering. They won't follow you around the internet like an annoying little sibling who you can't get away from. They won't profile you and sell it to another company. It's just a simple offering for you to read and look at. And they're popular! We've sold out every quarter we've put up for sale, sometimes nearly before they go public. How amazing is that?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re so thrilled to announce that we&rsquo;ve <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/"><strong>just opened up sponsor slots through July 2018</strong></a>. If you&rsquo;re one of the people who have been emailing us about dates — here they are! If you&rsquo;ve considered sponsoring before, step lively to pick up a prime week now.</p>

<p>And if you&rsquo;re a previous sponsor — well, we love you and want to show it. So, you get $25 off any slot through the end of today, Monday November 20th. Just <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/"sign up at the booking page</a> or send a quick note. We&rsquo;re always happy to hear from you</a></p>

<p>Each one-week sponsorship includes an ad on every page of the site; a full page dedicated to highlighting your book, event, class, or workshop (got something else in mind? <a href=mailto:sponsorships@seattlereviewofbooks.com>email us</a>), and a thank-you on the home page and over social media.</p>

<p>Two years ago we wrote about how we&rsquo;re aiming to <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">improve the model for internet advertising</a>. Together, we can make an impact and change the conversation. Local publishers, venues, and writers across all genres &mdash; our sponsors are truly the best. They help us keep the site alive, and make sure we can continue to publish reviews by writers new and known. In return, sponsors get exposure to the most passionate reading audience we’ve ever seen. <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/">Find out more</a>, and then reserve a slot before they&#8217;re gone.</p>
