<p>These events came in too late for me to add to <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/11/27/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-november-27th-december-3rd/">our readings calendar</a>, but you should definitely know about them: This coming Sunday, December 3rd, Seattle Civic Poet <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/08/01/anastacia-renee-is-seattles-next-civic-poet/">Anastacia-Renee</a> is hosting two very different events.</p>

<p>The first event, Speak to Me! is billed as &ldquo;an intergenerational monthly reading series showcasing emerging and seasoned poets,&rdquo; and the reading is &ldquo;followed by a 30-minute optional writing workshop facilitated by Anastacia-Renee and visiting workshop facilitators.&rdquo; Readers/facilitators at this event include Seattle poets Robert Francis Flor, Jalayna Carter, and the fabulous Quenton Baker. It starts at 1 pm and runs to 3:30, and it&rsquo;s at the Black Zone, which is located at 2301 S. Jackson St. in suite 203.</p>

<p>Then, Anastacia-Renee will scramble across town to a 5 pm reading she&rsquo;s curating at Open Books in Wallingford. This reading will include Anastacia-Renee&rsquo;s precedessor in the Civic Poet program, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/authors/claudia-castro-luna/">Claudia Castro Luna</a>. (Castro Luna will become the Washington State Poet Laureate next year.) They&rsquo;ll be joined by Lily Baumgart, who&rsquo;s serving as Seattle&rsquo;s Youth Poet Laureate, and local novelist <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/08/15/meet-the-new-writers-at-hugo-house/">Sonora Jha</a>, who is currently Hugo House&rsquo;s Writer in Residence. And if that&rsquo;s not enough, other readers include the wonderful Jekeva Phillips and Open Books&rsquo;s very first Poet-in-Residence, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/04/19/event-of-the-week-lena-khalaf-tuffaha-at-elliott-bay-book-company/">Lena Khalaf Tuffaha</a>.</p>

<p>I have already marveled at the fact that <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/07/19/literary-event-of-the-week-forget-it-reading-at-elliott-bay-book-company/">Anastacia-Renee is a dynamo of poetry</a>, but this Sunday is a herculean feat of poetic performance. Do you think you can keep up? She&rsquo;s daring you to try.</p>
