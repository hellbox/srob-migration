<p><a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/matt-driscoll/article162483123.html">Matt Driscoll at the <em>News Tribune</em></a> says that a new 11-acre park on a peninsula in Tacoma is super-close to being named after <em>Dune</em> author (and Tacoma native) Frank Herbert. Tacoma is now taking suggestions to name the park. Driscoll writes:</p>

<blockquote>According to Metro Parks spokesman Michael Thompson, 173 submissions were received over the weekend — and some variation of a name honoring Herbert was “the most common.” (There was at least one vote each for Parky McParkface and Breaky McWaterface.)</blockquote>

<p>The park looks like it&rsquo;ll be gorgeous:</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a Tacoma resident, you can suggest a name for the park on <a href="https://www.metroparkstacoma.org/dpd-peninsula-name">Metro Parks Tacoma&rsquo;s website</a> through August 4th.</p>
