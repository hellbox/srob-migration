<p>police<br>
glanced her tongue &amp; saw blade<br>
conjured gun<br>
from the cockiness<br>
of her throat dare breathe<br>
saw vertebrae of her quaking spine<br>
/ grenade keys<br>
mistook her words<br>
as / gunpowder<br>
every<br>
blink<br>
a<br>
/ trigger<br>
she<br>
pregnant ticking<br>
/ bomb.</p>

<p>seattle police call this nightmare-making<br>
“Training Policy”</p>

<p style="text-align:right">
(using a taser “wasn’t protocol”.<br>
“hands on approach” would have<br>
“put them at risk”<br>
pepper spray was “tactically counterproductive”<br>
could have endangered<br>
the officer’s ability<br>
to<br>
breathe.)
</p>

<p>“There was no viable alternative,”<br>
department says,<br>
besides twisting her body &mdash; black &amp; alive &mdash;<br>
into a banshee</p>

<p>a black woman’s body<br>
is always gleaned more weapon<br>
than mother<br>
as if nothing<br>
can harvest here but<br>
husks of babies<br>
&amp; bullets.</p>

<p><em>Charleena Lyle’s knife last seen:</em><br>
cutting the ribbon on Inauguration Day of Seattle’s new mayor<br>
whose glass-ceiling womanhood<br>
&mdash; like her title “trailblazer” &mdash;<br>
is also steeped in whiteness.</p>

<p><em>Charleena’s knife last seen:</em><br>
cutting the limestone of this<br>
Glittering Republic<br>
skyscraper<br>
by<br>
skyscraper<br>
headstones in a city she might<br>
have once called hers<br>
but would never hug<br>
her back</p>

<p><em>Charleena’s knife last seen:</em><br>
haunting the guilt of officers &amp; a city too infatuated<br>
with its own reflection<br>
to see her<br>
gleaming in the corners of<br>
their Trumped-up nightmares.</p>

<p>Seattle,<br>
after all,<br>
only has so much patience<br>
for those who are black <em>and</em> angry<br>
trauma longer than a soundbite<br>
and a week of headlines</p>

<p>“how awful they must feel,” someone pale &amp; alive tells me,<br>
“to have killed someone by mistake. To have to live with that.”</p>

<p style="text-align:right">
_police brutality ain’t supposed to happen here, right?<br>
not in this safe space city<br>
its liberals are so heartbroken.<br>
too bad their bleeding hearts don’t feed justice, just-stain hands.<br>
too bad their guilt never makes it to the courthouses, somehow.<br>
“too bad” “too bad” too bad”_</p>
   

<p><em>Charleena’s knife last seen:</em><br>
cutting umbilical cord of<br>
uniformed men<br>
babied by a society that will always<br>
call their fist an open palm<br>
who will never teach them how to pronounce<br>
a c c o u n t a b i l i t y<br>
in front of a mirror</p>

<p>“maybe they feel guilty,<br>
but she’s still dead,” I say.</p>

_Missing Persons Report for the Words I Did Not Say:_<br>
I CAN’T MAKE IT<br>
THROUGH AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE SHOOTING<br>
WITHOUT CRYING<br><br>
THE SOBS BEATING MY CHEST<br>
FEEL LIKE GUNSHOTS<br><br>
_Last seen:_<br>
shattering every,<br>
heart of glass<br> 
&amp; blood too dark<br>
to bring up at dinner.<br>
GUESS WHAT?<br>
YOU’RE REELING FROM THE KICKBACK OF A GUN<br>
YOU DON’T EVEN KNOW YOU SHOT.
</p>

<p>Charleena Lyles is still dead.<br>
Seattle thrives &amp; she is still dead.<br>
Mayor sharpens her reputation on her headstone at the MLK rally &amp; she is still dead<br>
Police try holding her knife<br>
up to a mirror<br>
it shrivels into ash<br>
yet she is still dead.</p>

<p><strong>she is still dead.<br>
she is still dead.</strong></p>
