<p>A Filipino restaurant is bone marrow<br>
and vinegar boiling<br>
perfectly over the sound<br>
of the most dramatic Tagalog<br>
soap opera you’ve ever been forced to watch.</p>

<p>I come here, when I can afford it,<br>
when my homesick can only be cured<br>
by my mother’s hands</p>

<p>The server is a young woman,<br>
possibly in her 20’s with a posture<br>
that’s been carrying the weight of her father’s expectations.</p>

<p>She calls me, “Ate” every time I come in.<br>
It means older sister in Tagalog.  </p>

<p>I can tell by the way she responds<br>
to her mother that she still lives at home,<br>
because Filipino women without husbands<br>
have no business being out on their own,<br>
she wears a crucifix on her necklace<br>
to remind her a man died for her once,<br>
her priest, her mother,<br>
her father, and her aunties<br>
won’t ever let her forget it.  </p>

<p>And she doesn’t know.<br>
But I’ve been there.<br>
Wanted to believe that<br>
I could behave and sit still.<br>
Find a nice boy to marry<br>
to shut my mom up and wear tradition<br>
and religion on my wedding day,</p>

<p>but I needed to be free.  </p>

<p>And I wonder what young women<br>
like this know about freedom.<br>
What it’s like to not have a predetermined destiny.<br>
To not always have to say the right thing,<br>
and dress the right way<br>
and be the dream<br>
that someone else dreamed for you.</p>

<p>But this glass house<br>
contains a boy<br>
with too many stones<br>
and not enough heart
to tell his mother he’s trans.<br>
Because I swore I would never tell my mother.<br>
Because she wouldn’t understand.</p>

<p>Because this is will make the pot boil over.<br>
And this young woman could’ve been my mother in past life</p>

<p>The woman behind the counter says,<br>
“Hi Ate.  how are you today?”</p>

<p>I smile.<br>
Hold back my painful desire<br>
to tell her I’m different now.<br> 
I went and got free.<br>
I am not your sister,<br>
but I’m still part of the family.<br>
But the smell of this adobo<br>
is whispering my mother’s name<br>
and I can’t unclench.  </p>

<p>My mother grips tradition<br>
and Catholicism so tightly<br>
she has no more knuckles for this.</p>

<p>I do not correct her.<br>
Continue this transaction like we normally would.</p>

<p>Do not try to axe at the root<br>
of this family tree we swing under<br>
I decide to never tell my mother<br>
I can’t be her daughter<br>
Do not throw these stones from your glass house, boy<br>
the only chain you have left<br>
Don’t anger your ancestors<br>
Don’t shame this family <em>anymore</em><br>
Do not come out <em>again</em><br>
Don’t do this to <em>us</em></p>

<p>So, I do not correct her.</p>

<p>Instead I settle into this excuse<br>
rather not uproot this tree from the ground</p>

<p>Rather not show her that she might be the one who is free</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>not me</p>

<p>We complete our business and she says, “Thanks Ate”<br>
But I’ve been used to being free for too long.<br>
My jaw shakes loose of the weight it’s been holding<br>
dislocates from my mouth<br>
and drops into the young woman’s hands</p>

<p>“Kuya” I say.<br>
which is a respectful title for<br>
“older brother”.</p>

<p>I do not expect her to catch me.<br>
My muscle memory braces itself for the shatter<br>
for the shards of stained glass<br>
church windows I’ve just smashed.</p>

<p>She says, “Have I been saying it wrong this whole time?”</p>

<p>And this is where I have to come out again.<br>
A decision to make to erase the history we’ve created together in our connection<br>
to erase my own history<br>
or to be loyal to who I’ve been</p>

<p>I choose to be loyal.</p>

<p>I say, “no.”<br>
Wait for the confusion, the hate, the back turned that I know so well</p>

<p>She says, “_Oh, Sige—Kuya_”</p>

<p>I smile.</p>

<p>And wonder how I will tell my mother that I am still her child.</p>
