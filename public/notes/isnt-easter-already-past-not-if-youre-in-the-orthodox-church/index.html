<p>If you&rsquo;re in the Orthodox church, Easter is still ahead, on May 1st this year. We&rsquo;re welcoming back sponsor Charlotte Riggle, whose children&rsquo;s book <em>Catherine&rsquo;s Pascha</em> follows a little girl&rsquo;s quest to stay awake for the overnight Pascha, or Easter, service.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not Orthodox, maybe you&rsquo;ll be wondering why the family next door are loading up the car with sleepy children all dressed up come April 30th. This book is a great way of understanding the faith of your neighbors and friends, and introducing children to the many ways that different people in the world worship. See a full-color sample from the book on our sponsor&rsquo;s page.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">take a look at our open dates</a>. We&rsquo;d love to talk to you about opportunities to sponsor us. It&rsquo;s our way of making internet advertising something to look forward to.</p>
