<p>This week you have two chances to see our Poet in Residence, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/julene-tripp-weaver/">Julene Tripp Weaver</a>, read her poetry aloud.</p>

<p>On Thursday, March 15th, Julene is reading at Soul Food Coffehouse in Redmond at 7 pm. She&rsquo;ll be sharing the stage with other poets including Anita K. Boyle, Nancy Canyon, Thom Schramm, Heidi Seaborn, and Michael Dylan Welch to celebrate an ice cream-related poetry anthology, titled <em>Ice Cream Poems: Reflections on Life with Ice Cream</em>. And of course there will be ice cream served at this reading. You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1677841348948371/">let them know you&rsquo;re coming on the Facebook Event page</a>.</p>

<p>And then the next day — Friday, March 16th — Julene will be reading from her latest book, <a href="https://www.finishinglinepress.com/product/truth-be-bold-by-julene-tripp-weaver/"><em>truth be bold — Serenading Life &amp; Death in the Age of AIDS</em></a>, at 7 pm at Open Books. This is a big reading for her because it&rsquo;s the first event celebrating <em>truth be bold</em> since it was announced as a finalist in the <a href="https://www.lambdaliterary.org/lambda-literary-award-finalists/">Bisexual Nonfiction category of the Lambda Literary Awards</a>, up against esteemed competition including Roxane Gay&rsquo;s <em>Hunger</em>. Julene will be sharing the stage with Seattle poetry legend Tara Hardy. This is billed as a scent-free event, so please leave the perfumes and such at home.</p>

<p>Both events are free. Go out and show your support for a longtime Seattle poet whose work is finally getting some of the recognition it deserves. We couldn&rsquo;t be prouder to celebrate Julene&rsquo;s work on our site in this, a momentous month in her career as a Seattle poet.</p>
