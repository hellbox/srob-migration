<p>As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/arts/macarthur-foundation-announces-2016-genius-grant-winners.html?_r=0">Jennifer Schuessler reported in the <em>New York Times</em></a>, the MacArthur Foundation announced their annual &ldquo;Genius&rdquo; grant winners yesterday. I&rsquo;m very excited to see that the new list of &ldquo;Geniuses&rdquo; includes authors we&rsquo;ve written about here at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> over the past year.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Willie Fitzgerald <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-publishers-dilemma/">wrote a review incorporating <strong>Claudia Rankine</strong>&rsquo;s compelling poetry collection <em>Citizen</em></a> last year.</p></li>

<li><p>The brilliant <strong>Maggie Nelson</strong> has been written about a few times here on the site, most notably in <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/body-of-work/">Cate McGehee&rsquo;s splendid review of <em>The Argonauts</em></a> and Jennifer Bernstein&rsquo;s review of, among other books, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/a-cruel-mistress/">Nelson&rsquo;s <em>The Art of Cruelty</em></a>.</p></li>

<li><p>I reviewed <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/07/14/thursday-comics-hangover-the-super-man-of-shanghai/">the first issue of cartoonist Gene Luen Yang&rsquo;s comic book <em>New Super-Man</em></a> when it was released two months ago.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations to all the &ldquo;Geniuses,&rdquo; (Those quotation marks are accurate, according to the MacArthur style guide, but they always feel so sarcastic whenever I write about the MacArthur grants that I always consider leaving them out.) I look forward to publishing many more pieces about their works here on the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> in years to come.</p>
