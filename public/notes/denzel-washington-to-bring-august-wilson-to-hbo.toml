Yesterday, [Denzel Washington announced](http://deadline.com/2015/09/denzel-washington-hbo-august-wilson-1201533153/) that he's going to produce adaptations of all ten plays in Seattle playwright August Wilson's [Pittsburgh Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Wilson#The_Pittsburgh_Cycle) for HBO over the next ten years. This is a hugely ambitious project, and we look forward to Wilson staying at the top of the cultural conversation for another decade because of it.
