<p>Conservative sci-fi troll Theodore Beale, who seemed dumb a few years ago when he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Puppies">tried to game the Hugo Awards</a> but now appears to have been a tiny droplet in the imbecilic wave of white male entitlement currently cresting in the culture, is back at it. Beale is currently trolling sci-fi superstar John Scalzi by publishing <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/amazon-pulls-castalia-house-book-for-ripping-off-john-s-1793533638">a book with a very similar title and cover to Scalzi&rsquo;s new novel, <em>The Collapsing Empire</em></a>. Scalzi, as i09&rsquo;s Beth Elderkin notes, is a bestselling author and one of the best-known sci-fi authors in the business. Beale is a jealous little mealworm who has finally resorted to publishing literary mockbusters.</p>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s true what they say about obsession; it will eat you up from the inside until there&rsquo;s nothing left of you.</p>
