Our thanks to Floating Bridge Press for their sponsorship this week. They're showing off 2015 chapbook award winner Michael Schmeltzer, and his winning work _Elegy/Elk River_. The titular poem is <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">available to read on our sponsors page</a>, and it is an amazing piece of work. His accolades are well deserved.

The 2016 Chapbook Competition is now accepting entries. The winner will be joining an impressive <a href="http://www.floatingbridgepress.org/chapbook/" title="Chapbooks | Floating Bridge Press">line of poets</a> going back twenty years. There's more information on the <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">sponsor page</a>, but if you're a poet looking for opportunities to submit your work, you should certainly pay attention here. You'd walk away with a cash prize, and publication of your chapbook. Be sure to check it out.

Also, big news! We've just opened up our Spring/Summer block of sponsorships, and we have some openings coming up as early as February. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">Book now to grab your spot</a>, our last block of sponsorships sold out.
