Remember when [I told you](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/29/mein-kampf-returns-to-germany/) that *Mein Kampf* was about to be published in Germany again for the first time since World War II? Yeah, it [sold out](https://www.rt.com/news/328494-mein-kampf-germany-sale/) in less than a week. This is not the ending to this story that I was hoping for. 

(Vaguely related: one time back in my bookselling days, a customer tried to return a copy of *Mein Kampf* because it was an "inferior text." He was upset that the introduction was written by a Jewish person. I just stared at him for a bit and then walked away.)
