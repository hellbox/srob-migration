What I brew in me<br>
your tongue no longer tastes. 

Do you believe passion<br>
or security 

ruins the palette?<br>
We once boiled red 

like the most glorious<br> 
emergency

and at the worst times.<br>
Sip me 

before I’m lukewarm,<br>
before the whistle of regret 

keeps us awake.<br>
Dear love, last night 

I walked in the rain<br>
dressed only in a bathrobe. I bought 

a little kettle on sale<br>
and am convinced our lives

will be better now.<br>
I am not sad 

when I say this. I am not quite<br>
unsad either. 

If there is one thing to be said<br>
about marriage or monogamy 

there is another thing entirely<br>
to be undone. Clean or dirty 

is how I divide the day.<br>
After you leave 

or before you come home.<br>
The more I smell 

of cleaning products<br>
the messier it means I am. 

The toilet, the kitchen sink,<br>
every closet–this house 

is yours to pollute.<br>
I’ve been alone 

in it<br>
for many, many hours. 

Look around.<br>
There’s no trace of me. 

It’s as if<br>
I don’t even exist.
