<p>Two housekeeping issues we&rsquo;d like to share with our readers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you&rsquo;re a Hugo House member, you can now sign up for <a href="https://hugohouse.org/store/class/the-you-review-of-books-paul-constant-and-martin-mcclellan/">&ldquo;The You Review of Books,&rdquo;</a> a book reviewing class taught by myself and <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> co-founder Martin McClellan. We hope to teach you how to communicate with art, how to be a better reader, and how to appreciate book reviewing as an art form. If you&rsquo;re not a Hugo House member, you&rsquo;ll be able to sign up for the class starting next week. But you really ought to be a member of the Hugo House.</p></li>

<li><p>Next week, Martin and I will be <a href="http://www.phinneybooks.com/upcoming-events/">reading at Phinney Books</a> to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the Dock Street Salon, a very fun reading series that combines readings and informal chats in a laid-back setting. If you have any questions about this here website or our upcoming class, please drop on by. We hope to see you there.</p></li>
</ul>
