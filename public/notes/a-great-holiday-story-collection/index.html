<p>You may or may not be ready for the holidays, but it&rsquo;s <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/">never the wrong time to read a great collection of themed stories</a>. This week&rsquo;s sponsor Grey Sun Press offers just that with <em>Joy to the Worlds: Mysterious Speculative Fiction for the Holidays</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a season&rsquo;s worth of cross-genre stories revolving around the legends and trappings of the Winter season holidays, by four accomplished local writers: Maia Chance, Janine A. Southard, Raven Oak, and G. Clemens.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re throwing a bunch of parties around this book, and we have a <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/">full list on our sponosor page</a>, as well as samples from four of the stories that appear in the book.</p>

<p>Grey Sun Press has partnered with us to get their work in front of your eyes. We think you&rsquo;ll love it, but with our sponsorship model, we offer you enough that you can make up your own mind. It&rsquo;s part of our campaign to make <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">internet advertising 100 percent less terrible</a>. Thanks for being a part of it with us.</p>
