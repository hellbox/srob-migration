<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/03/31/marvels-david-gabriel-sales-slump-people-didnt-want-diversity-didnt-want-female-characters/">some comments made at a sales conference</a> by Marvel Comics&rsquo;s Senior VP of Sales, David Gabriel, set the internet on fire. Gabriel was referring to a recent sales slump for Marvel books, and he seemed to place the entire blame for the slump on Marvel&rsquo;s attempts at diversity:</p>

<blockquote><p>What we heard was that **people didn’t want any more diversity.  They didn’t want female characters out there**.  That’s what we heard, whether we believe that or not.  I don’t know that that’s really true, but that’s what we saw in sales.</p>

<p>We saw **the sales of any character that was diverse, any character that was new, our female characters**, anything that was not a core Marvel character, people were turning their nose up against.  That was difficult for us because we had a lot of fresh, new, exciting ideas that we were trying to get out and nothing new really worked.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is dumb. While it&rsquo;s true that Marvel has been diversifying their line lately, it&rsquo;s important to note that at least half the new &ldquo;diverse&rdquo; characters were written by the same middle-aged white men who have been writing Marvel Comics for the last 15 years or so. It&rsquo;s also important to note that Marvel didn&rsquo;t actively try to create a larger, more diverse audience for their comics: they continued marketing and selling to the same crowd of middle-aged men who&rsquo;ve been buying their comics the whole time.</p>

<p>But you don&rsquo;t need me to dissemble Gabriel&rsquo;s moronic statements. Seattle writer G. Willow Wilson, who writes Ms. Marvel for Marvel Comics, has <a href="http://gwillowwilson.com/post/159094504658/so-about-that-whole-thing">published a blog post on the subject</a>. Ms. Marvel is one of Marvel Comics&rsquo; only breakout new characters of the past decade. Wilson has helped create a diversity success story in exactly the way you should: by bringing more people into the tent. Here&rsquo;s a piece of the post:</p>

<blockquote><p>2. I will tell you exactly why Ms Marvel works: it didn’t set out to be Ms Marvel. We were originally going to pitch it as a 10 issue limited series. I had a 3 issue exit strategy because I assumed we were going to get canned. There was no “diversity initiative” anywhere–getting that thing made at all was a struggle. It was a given that any character without AT LEAST a 20-year history would tank. Everybody, myself included, assumed this series was going to work out the same way.</p>

<p>3. That freed us–by “us” I mean the whole creative team–to tell exactly the story we wanted to tell. We had nothing to lose, nothing to overcome but low expectations. That gave us room to break a lot of rules.</p></blockquote>

<p>But you should <a href="http://gwillowwilson.com/post/159094504658/so-about-that-whole-thing">read the whole thing</a>. Wilson, by the way, will be interviewing cartoonist Faith Erin Hicks onstage at the Elliott Bay Book Company tomorrow night at 7 pm. (Hicks is the author of the excellent <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/no-one-owns-a-city/">Nameless City trilogy, which I reviewed last week</a>.) That reading is free.</p>
