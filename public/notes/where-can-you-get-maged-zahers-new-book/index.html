<p>This week, I reviewed Maged Zaher&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-seattle-globalist/">big new career-spanning collection, <em>Opting Out</em></a>. It&rsquo;s published by local press Chatwin Books, which is based out of Pioneer Square used bookstore Arundel Books.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve tried to order Zaher&rsquo;s new book online, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed that it&rsquo;s not available. I talked with Chatwin/Arundel owner Phil Bevis about why that is. Basically, Arundel Books had to suddenly move their store to a newer, more favorable location. (Previously it was facing Occidental Park. Now it&rsquo;s at 212 1st Ave S.) But because the move consumed so much of Arundel/Chatwin&rsquo;s time and resources, the book has been delayed.</p>

<p>Bevis says the new publication date for <em>Opting Out</em> is April 7th. Any books you pre-order through IndieBound or <a href="http://www.chatwinbooks.com">http://www.chatwinbooks.com</a> or any other online retailer will be fulfilled then. But if you can&rsquo;t wait to get your hands on a copy — and you should be eager to get your hands on a copy; it&rsquo;s an exemplary work — Bevis says &ldquo;a limited number of pre-release copies are available now at Arundel Books&rsquo; new location.&rdquo; So the only place in the world to buy Maged Zaher&rsquo;s new book right now is in Pioneer Square. Stop by, check out Arundel Books, and get a super-rare pre-pub edition.</p>
