Looks like Amazon gave the *Seattle Times* the exclusive. [Jay Greene reports](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-opens-first-bricks-and-mortar-bookstore-at-u-village/):

<blockquote><p>At 9:30 Tuesday morning, the online retail giant will open will open [sic] its first-ever brick-and-mortar retail store in its 20-year life in University Village.</p>

<p>The store, called Amazon Books, looks a lot like bookstores that populate malls across the country. Its wood shelves are stocked with 5,000 to 6,000 titles, best-sellers as well as Amazon.com customer favorites.</p></blockquote>

We will of course go and investigate Amazon Books and report back soon. But in terms of quick takes: **that's not a lot of titles** for a bookstore to carry. Elliott Bay Book Company, for example, [has 150,000 titles](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/node/about).
