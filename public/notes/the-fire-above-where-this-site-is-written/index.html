I also did a blurb about <a href="https://hugohouse.org/wherewewrite-martin-mcclellan/" title="None">where I write, for Hugo House</a>.

<p>In my studio, I write fiction, I work on the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>, and I ship <a href="http://californiafouroclock.com" title="California Four O&amp;rsquo;Clock by Martin McClellan">copies of my novel <em>California Four O&rsquo;Clock</em></a>.</p>

<p>Where do you write? Just remember to tag it: #<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WhereWeWrite?src=hash" title="#wherewewrite">WhereWeWrite</a>.</p>
