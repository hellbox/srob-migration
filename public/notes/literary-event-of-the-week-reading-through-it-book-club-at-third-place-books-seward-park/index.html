<p>The second year of the post-Trump book club founded by the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> and <em>Seattle Weekly</em> officially begins <a href="https://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/reading-through-it-weapons-math-destruction">this Wednesday at Third Place Book Seward Park</a>.</p>

<p>This month, for a change of pace, we&rsquo;re talking about something not specifically related to Trump, Russia, or the Republican Party. Instead, our choice, Cathy O&rsquo;Neil&rsquo;s <em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em>, is about the rise of data and algorithmic systems. It&rsquo;s probably hard for you to place a priority on data management when the whole world is falling apart around you. But O&rsquo;Neil argues that our faulty mechanisms of data management are exacerbating our problems.</p>

<p>Obviously, algorithms are responsible for the spread of &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; on Facebook, and the ability of Russians to interfere with the outcomes of the 2016 presidential election. But O&rsquo;Neil points out that data can enhance pre-existing structures of racism and classism, creating a negative feedback loop that accidentally &ldquo;proves&rdquo; the problems that data collection is intended to solve.</p>

<p>This is important stuff, and it will be a big part of the conversation as we move toward the 2018 midterm elections. <em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em> is available for 20% off at Third Place Books right now, though no purchase is necessary to join us for the book club. I hope to see you there.</p>
