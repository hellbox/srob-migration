GoodReads just [put up a blog post](https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/545-how-the-girl-on-the-train-became-a-runaway-success) about the stunning success of Paula Hawkins's thriller *The Girl on the Train*. If you're into metrics, this will fascinate you. If you're a big believer in the power of reviews — as I am — it will affirm your worldview in a satisfying way. And that's what the internet is all about, right? Affirming your worldview in a satisfying way?

Also satisfying: the post's comment section, which is mostly full of people who, like me, thought *The Girl on the Train* was an unremarkable thriller.
