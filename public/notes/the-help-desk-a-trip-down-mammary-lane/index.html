<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>Help me to not be a boob! I'm a dude and a writer and every time I go to describe a woman I write something about her rack. I know this drives women readers crazy, and for good reason.</strong></p>
 

<p><strong>But! I&rsquo;m queer. Boobs to me have about as much sex appeal as cow udders. This isn&rsquo;t about male gaze (I don&rsquo;t think?), and sometimes a woman&rsquo;s breasts tell a story — like an old Russian lady with really big ones who is very modest and keeps that shit locked down tight. There&rsquo;s obviously some kind of management there that helps define who she is, right?
 </strong></p>

<p><strong>Or my sister talking about how big her “tits” (her words) got when she was pregnant — that&rsquo;s not a character trait per se, but it is something honest worth mentioning, right?</strong></p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m a guy, but I don&rsquo;t want to be THAT guy. Is there a rule of thumb to help me here?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Bottle fed, Burien</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Bottle fed,</p>

<p class="noindent">Being gay doesn't inoculate you against sexism, just as being a cultural latina (olé!) doesn't make me incapable of racism. As you noted, there are times when writing about breasts helps inform the reader about a character or the narrator. There are also many times when writing about boobs is lazy shorthand for a woman's sexual appeal, which in turn is lazy shorthand for her worth in the world.</p>

<p>So here are a few questions to consider the next time you begin fixating on a character&rsquo;s breasts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are these boobs central to the scene taking place right now?</li>
<li>What am I trying to convey by focusing on these boobs?</li>
<li>Is this the best way to impart that message to readers?</li>
<li>Are these boobs that I&rsquo;m describing the boobs of a female character?</li>
<li>If so, why the fuck don&rsquo;t I ever write about male boobs? Men have chests, too, and many men even have boobs and sensitive areolas.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another exercise you might try: Take a few descriptions of your characters, swap their pronouns (or remove pronouns altogether) and re-read the descriptions aloud. It will help you identify the crutches you rely on and gender biases you may have.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses!</p>
