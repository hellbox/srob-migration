<p>The owner of a comic book store called Pristine Comics in Federal Way recently <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Seattle-area-shop-sells-rare-first-Wonder-Woman-12164743.php">sold three collectible Wonder Woman comics for 1.5 million dollars</a>, writes Daniel DeMay for the <em>Seattle PI</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Public service announcement</strong>: This does not mean that the comics your mom threw away after you went to college are worth millions of dollars. Most comics do not have much, if any, resale value. Please don&rsquo;t get mad at comics dealers when they tell you the stack of musty comics you brought in are only worth about five bucks. They&rsquo;re just doing their job.</p>
