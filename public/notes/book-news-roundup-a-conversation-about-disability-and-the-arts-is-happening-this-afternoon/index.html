<li><p>Sorry for the late notice, but <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/607068906114933/">today at 4:30 pm</a>, Seattle author Nicola Griffith will join Riva Lehrer to discus disabilities in arts and culture. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/27/talking-with-nicola-griffith-about-the-importance-of-counting-womens-stories/">Griffith is a <em>SRoB</em> favorite</a>, and disabilities and the arts are not discussed very often in this town. So if you&rsquo;re free this afternoon, you should head up to the Odegaard Undergraduate Library for this event.</p></li>

<li><p>This morning, <a href="http://the-toast.net/2016/05/13/we-are-closing-the-toast-july-1st/">the editors of The Toast announced</a> that the site will be ending on July 1st.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>**NICOLE**: You have a WHOLE OTHER JOB and a book in progress, I think youâ€™ll stay busy. Oh, let me state for the record that we do not do NOT want anyone to start a Save The Toast campaign of any kind, even though it would be so obviously lovely and kind of you! We are done.</p>

<p>**MALLORY**: No Kickstarters, please. If you start one I promise I will waste every single penny sent my way on expensive single-serving cakes and various perfumed unguents designed to enhance my beauty.</p></blockquote>

<li><p>The shortlist for the Caine Prize for African Writing has been released. If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about African literature, you <a href="http://caineprize.com/2016-shortlist/">can&rsquo;t really go wrong with this list</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Cartoonist Chester Brown&rsquo;s latest book, <em>Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus</em>, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/theres-something-about-mary/">confused the hell out of <em>SRoB</em> co-founder Martin Mcclellan and I</a>. But maybe we&rsquo;re not the only ones who were confused: comics blog The Beat discovered that Brown <a href="http://www.comicsbeat.com/chester-brown-vs-the-bible-the-final-chapter/">seems to have admitted</a> accidentally misinterpreting a Bible passage in such a way that it furthered his own thesis. Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t invalidate Brown&rsquo;s book, but it does add another complicated layer to a book that is already made up of complicated layers.</p></li>

<li><p>I mean, these <a href="http://www.teleread.com/spellbound-uses-augmented-reality-to-turn-childrens-books-into-digital-pop-up-books/">digital pop-up books</a> look fun and everything, but aren&rsquo;t real pop-up books a lot cooler than these? Just saying.</p></li>

<li><p>If you ever wanted to read <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> but thought it had way too many words, the <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2016/05/13/the-communist-manifesto-in-pictures/">good folks at Crooked Timber</a> have found <a href="http://ucf.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/ucf%3A5057">a PDF of a 1948 <em>Illustrated Communist Manifesto</em></a>. Some of the drawings in this thing are truly incredible.</p></li>
