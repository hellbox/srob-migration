<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>What do you think about posthumously releasing books that authors didn’t want us to see? On the one hand, you get unnecessary books like Nabokov’s *The Original of Laura*, and on the other, there’s Kafka’s entire oeuvre. I’m torn.</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Shelton, Winslow</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Shelton,</p>

<p class="noindent">Speaking as a living human being (I DARE YOU TO PROVE OTHERWISE), I enjoy writing because of its control – my mouth often doesn't convey meaning nearly as well as my human fingers do. I believe many writers feel this way about their work; at it's best, it's the truest expression of their ideas and intentions. Anything less than its best is a work in progress.</p>

<p>So yes, I find it problematic that someone else would take that control away and publish a writer&rsquo;s work without consent – or worse, against their express wishes, as was the case with much of Kafka&rsquo;s work and Harper Lee&rsquo;s <em>Go Set a Watchman</em>, which I refuse to read because in addition to resentful uterus syndrome and arachnofealty, I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with a deferential corpse complex.</p>

<p>That said, I don&rsquo;t believe in any afterlife, so the part of me that&rsquo;s dead inside doesn&rsquo;t really give a fuck whether they&rsquo;re published or not, and I don&rsquo;t believe Lee or Kafka care at this point either.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
