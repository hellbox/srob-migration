<p class="intro">(with apologies to Philip Larkin)</p>

<p>Contemporary romance peaked<br>
In nineteen-fifty-eight<br>
(Which of course was rather late)<br>
When mousy Midtown office girls<br>
Sought out rich men to date.</p>

<p>Now, since then there&#8217;s only been<br>
A sort of echoing<br>
Of Heyer&#8217;s style of thing;<br>
A virgin beauty&#8217;s quest to find<br>
A duke for marrying.</p>

<p>For all at once, the smut appeared:<br>
Everyone fucked the same<br>
And every book became<br>
A drenched and dizzy bacchanal<br>
Quite free from tact or shame.</p>

<p>So books were never better than<br>
In nineteen-fifty-eight;<br>
And now is far too late<br>
For those mousy Midtown office girls<br>
And the wealthy men they date.</p>

<p class="poem-footer">Yesterday, [Olivia Waite published a response](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/09/27/robert-gottlieb-is-obviously-smitten/) to the hackneyed Robert Gottlieb article in the _New York Times_. She also submitted this poem, which we couldn't resist. This one's for our romance readers. </p>
