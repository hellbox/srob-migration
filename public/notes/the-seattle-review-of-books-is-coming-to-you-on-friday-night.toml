Tomorrow night, you'll have two opportunities to see the co-founders of the *Seattle Review of Books* in public events.

I'll be part of [a special panel at Town Hall](https://townhallseattle.org/event/happy-hour-voting-party/) hosted by Seattlish editor Hanna Brooks  Olsen. It's a voting happy hour, and a bunch of smart folks — including Mayor Mike McGinn, [*South Seattle Emerald* editor Marcus Harrison Green](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/theres-no-place-like-home/), and more — will be on hand to help you work through the important issues on your ballot. So if you're not sure how to vote this year, come talk to me about it. I promise to not be bossy about it. Plus: free stamps! It's at 5:30, it's absolutely free, and it should be a good time. 

But if you've already voted, or if you're looking for something book-related to do, you should head to Phinney Books, where the *Seattle Review of Books* co-founder Martin McClellan will be taking part in [a literary wake](http://www.phinneybooks.com/upcoming-events/2016/10/28/dock-street-salon-a-literary-wake) for the hardcover edition of Phinney Books owner Tom Nissley's extraordinary book *The Reader's Book of Days*. The idea of mourning for a remaindered title is a great, funny idea, and Martin will be joined by local writers Joshua Mohr and Nicole Dierker. This event is free, refreshments will be served, and it starts at 7 pm.

And the best news? If you hurry, you can probably **attend both events** in one super-packed evening. We'll see you out there.
