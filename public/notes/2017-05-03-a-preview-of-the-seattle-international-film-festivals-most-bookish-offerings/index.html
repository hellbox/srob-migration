        <p>This morning, tickets to the 2017 edition of the Seattle International Film Festival go on sale for SIFF members. This year&rsquo;s SIFF is huge (400 films from 80 countries) and diverse. Highlights include a series spotlighting films from nations on President Trump&rsquo;s travel ban list, an education series for kids, and a heavy focus on Northwest filmmakers, women directors, and films that as of yet have no established North American premiere dates.</p>

<p>Tickets for the general public go on sale starting tomorrow. (If you&rsquo;re not a SIFF member, <a href="https://www.siff.net/support/membership">I recommend it</a>; you get discounted tickets and free popcorn and early access to events like, well, festival screenings.) I attended the SIFF press launch last night and I have some tips on bookish movies that readers of the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> might want to keep in mind. Here&rsquo;s an overview of some of the literary and literary-adjacent SIFF films:</p>

<p><em>The Young Karl Marx</em> is the closing-night film of the festival, screening on Sunday, June 11, at Cinerama. It&rsquo;s a biopic from Raoul Peck (director of the excellent <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/02/07/now-playing-james-baldwins-brilliance-and-heartbreak/"><em>I Am Not Your Negro</em></a>) about the birth of the friendship between Friedrich Engels and a passionate young writer named Karl Marx.</p>

<p>The closing seconds of the trailer for the raunchy Middle Ages nun comedy <em>The Little Hours</em> claims that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Based on <em>The Decameron</em> by Boccacio.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s maybe a stretch, but with a cast like this — Alison Brie, Aubrey Plaza, John C. Reilly, Nick Offerman — I&rsquo;m willing to give it some room for literary license.</p>

<p>Based on the Stephen Fry novel of the same name, <em>The Hippopotamus</em>  is about an alcoholic writer who travels to the countryside in order to debunk a reported series of miracles.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a big year for fairy tales at SIFF. The French films <em>The Girl Without Hands</em> and <em>Ivan Tsarevitch and the Changing Princess: Four Enchanting Tales</em> adapt fairy tales into animated movies. <em>The Girl Without Hands</em> is a Brothers Grimm deep cut. <em>Revolting Rhymes</em> collects five of Roald Dahl&rsquo;s poetic fairy-tale updates into cute animated shorts.</p>

<p><em>Lady Macbeth</em> isn&rsquo;t based on Shakespeare; rather, it&rsquo;s adapted from a Russian novella from 1865 by Nikolai Leskov titled <em>Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District</em>. (The novella has also been adapted into an opera by Dmitri Shostakovich.) I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this one to land for a while; seems like I first saw the trailer months ago.</p>

<p>Some other quick hits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Based on a memoir titled <em>The Hypocrisy of Disco</em>, the film <em>Lane 1974</em> is a coming-of-age film about a 13-year-old girl with a decidedly unreliable mother.</p></li>

<li><p>Austin-based junk-rock orchestra The Invincible Czars will be performing their score for the 1920 silent-film version of <em>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em> live at The Triple Door on Thursday, June 6.</p></li>

<li><p><em>The Truth About Love Is &hellip;</em>, which is making its North American debut at SIFF, is based on a popular Italian memoir by a divorced housewife.</p></li>

<li><p>The <em>Captain Underpants</em> movie will make its Seattle debut at SIFF, if your kids are into that kind of thing.</p></li>

<li><p>The festival also features a tribute to Anjelica Huston that features two of her best adaptations — Jim Thompson&rsquo;s creepy con-artist noir <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-aSj4uiR90"><em>The Grifters</em></a> and Roald Dahl&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_ZyqaN_XNM"><em>The Witches</em></a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be running reviews and news from the literary side of SIFF in the days and weeks ahead. For now, <a href="https://www.siff.net/festival/box-office">go get your tickets</a>.</p>
