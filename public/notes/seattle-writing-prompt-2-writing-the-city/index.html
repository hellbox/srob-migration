<p class="intro">Ask any writer: the two most difficult parts of the writing process are **1)** sitting down in the seat to write and **2)** figuring out what to write about. We *can't* help you focus on your work, but we *can* try to help you find inspiration in the city around you. That's what Seattle Writing Prompts is all about. These prompts are offered free to anyone who needs them; all the *Seattle Review of Books* asks in return is that you thank us in the acknowledgements when you turn it into a book.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t read that many good books about graffiti. Jonathan Lethem&rsquo;s <em>Fortress of Solitude</em> is the first one that comes to mind, though I know I&rsquo;ve read others. Why isn&rsquo;t there more good fiction about graffiti? Don&rsquo;t writers love to write about writers? And aren&rsquo;t graffiti artists just another kind of writer, explaining the city around them?</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re having trouble finding inspiration, go take a walk. Focus on noticing the graffiti. When you find a piece that speaks to you — maybe it&rsquo;s half-finished, maybe it&rsquo;s clever, maybe it&rsquo;s crude — try to write about it. What was the artist trying to say? What are the different ways the piece could be interpreted? Where&rsquo;s the artist right now?</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re unable to go out for a walk, my friend Renée Krulich has <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/krulich/albums">a world-class Flickr stream</a> on which she documents seemingly every single piece of graffiti in Seattle that she can find. They&rsquo;re all organized in albums alphabetically by artist, from famous names like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/krulich/albums/72157649317283211">John Criscitello</a> to sticker artists like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/krulich/albums/72157649888158040">&lsquo;Phones</a>. Personally, I&rsquo;m fond of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/krulich/albums/72157624553871900">Sti&copy;kman</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/krulich/albums/72157631893263478">Allo</a>, but you can choose whomever you like. Or maybe you finally want to get to the bottom of the eternal Seattle question: what&rsquo;s the deal with <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/krulich/albums/72157626594948200">SHITbARF</a>? There must be a novel there. At <em>least</em>.</p>
