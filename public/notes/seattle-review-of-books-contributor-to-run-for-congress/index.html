<p>We are so excited that <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/brianna-wu/">Brianna Wu</a> is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/21/14041542/brianna-wu-congress-campaign-gamergate-harassment">running for Congress in 2018</a> and we hope that she&rsquo;s the first of many <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> contributors to run for public office. (I&rsquo;d love to vote for Mayor Nisi Shawl one day.)</p>
