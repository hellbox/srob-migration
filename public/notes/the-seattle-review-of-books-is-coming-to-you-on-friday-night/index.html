<p>Tomorrow night, you&rsquo;ll have two opportunities to see the co-founders of the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> in public events.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be part of <a href="https://townhallseattle.org/event/happy-hour-voting-party/">a special panel at Town Hall</a> hosted by Seattlish editor Hanna Brooks  Olsen. It&rsquo;s a voting happy hour, and a bunch of smart folks — including Mayor Mike McGinn, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/theres-no-place-like-home/"><em>South Seattle Emerald</em> editor Marcus Harrison Green</a>, and more — will be on hand to help you work through the important issues on your ballot. So if you&rsquo;re not sure how to vote this year, come talk to me about it. I promise to not be bossy about it. Plus: free stamps! It&rsquo;s at 5:30, it&rsquo;s absolutely free, and it should be a good time.</p>

<p>But if you&rsquo;ve already voted, or if you&rsquo;re looking for something book-related to do, you should head to Phinney Books, where the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> co-founder Martin McClellan will be taking part in <a href="http://www.phinneybooks.com/upcoming-events/2016/10/28/dock-street-salon-a-literary-wake">a literary wake</a> for the hardcover edition of Phinney Books owner Tom Nissley&rsquo;s extraordinary book <em>The Reader&rsquo;s Book of Days</em>. The idea of mourning for a remaindered title is a great, funny idea, and Martin will be joined by local writers Joshua Mohr and Nicole Dierker. This event is free, refreshments will be served, and it starts at 7 pm.</p>

<p>And the best news? If you hurry, you can probably <strong>attend both events</strong> in one super-packed evening. We&rsquo;ll see you out there.</p>
