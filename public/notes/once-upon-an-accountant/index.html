<p>Once upon a time<br>
an accountant there was<br>
who numbers loved</p>

<p>And every day<br>
numbers flew in<br>
and numbers floated away<br>
and days were numbers<br>
and also gloves and boots and<br>
numbers counted the noodles</p>

<p>in his soup as he ate it</p>

<p>Until one day began<br>
the numbers to slip<br>
their shapes, to stand<br>
up off their stools, to spool<br>
into nests of number<br>
and start to nap</p>

<p>And grew afraid the accountant<br>
and strung up by elbows<br>
the numbers and<br>
to their chairs<br>
he tied them with garden<br>
twine and wire</p>

<p>And could not move<br>
the numbers now or wave<br>
or cartwheel their dance,<br>
their fountaining over<br>
each other all over, forgot,<br>
the way they rose to the top<br>
and tumbled down<br>
began to be a dream</p>

<p>Until at last sneaked out<br>
the accountant from his corner<br>
to cut with nail scissors<br>
the bonds, to filch<br>
from the window an inch of air<br>
to nudge a number, struggling,<br>
to the sill and watch it, gasping,</p>

<p>toss itself out over into<br>
the hedge. And then its brother.<br>
And then its mother. And then<br>
its son. Each number went.<br>
Except for one.</p>

<p>And since that day ever<br>
holds he the zero<br>
to himself, at center chest,<br>
hand over its open mouth<br>
so hear he cannot<br>
the tiny ringing cry: alone,<br>
alone, alone,<br>
alone.</p>
