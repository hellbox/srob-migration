<p>I have to admit something: <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/07/thursday-comics-hangover-everybodys-talking-about-the-black-panther/">I loved the first issue of Ta-Nehisi Coates&rsquo;s <em>Black Panther</em></a>, but the series has largely lost my interest in the intervening year-and-a-half. That first issue was a perfect balance between pop-culture philosphy and superhero action, and Coates seemed to be attempting a more stylish version of a text-heavy style of comics writing that we haven&rsquo;t seen in mainstream comics since the 1980s.</p>

<p>But gradually, over the next few issues, Coates&rsquo;s writing went from wordy to overindulgent to bloated. Long stretches would happen where people would talk in self-important prose and all the important story beats seemed to be happening off-panel. The recap pages would contain more palace drama than the actual comics pages.</p>

<p>And to cap it all off, Brian Stelfreeze, the artist who started <em>Black Panther</em> with Coates, seemed to entirely disappear. Stelfreeze has always had difficulty hitting a monthly deadline, but this book used so much of his visual language that when he stopped drawing the title, the characters seemed to lose their motivation with him. I ordinarily adore Chris Sprouse, the artist who has taken Stelfreeze&rsquo;s place, but Sprouse&rsquo;s superheroic figures, who always seem ready to leap off the page their impossible musculatures and lantern jaws, feel badly mismatched with Coates&rsquo;s action-free scripts.</p>

<p>All that said, the latest issue of <em>Black Panther</em>, #16, is the most exciting issue in a long time. In just a few pages, Coates manages to reinvigorate a background character from the Marvel Universe in a way that feels entirely authentic and thought-provoking, yet still true to the character. The few scenes with this character combine social commentary, some fun writing, and a genuine passion for the Marvel Comics framework.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not enough to salvage the whole issue. Back-up characters appear and disappear with no explanation. The story wants to raise stakes without actually investing in building the drama, and Coates can&rsquo;t seem to find a working rhythm for the book.</p>

<p>Perhaps <em>Black Panther</em> reads differently in trade paperback; it&rsquo;s possible that it flows better when given the same attention one would apply to a novel. But as a monthly comic, it&rsquo;s consistently the least interesting book in the stack I bring home from the comic shop. The great promise of that first issue feels squandered.</p>
