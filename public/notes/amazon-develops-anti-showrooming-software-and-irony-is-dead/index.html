<p>Amazon grew its book business in large part due to showrooming: ask any bookseller and they&rsquo;ll tell you horror stories of customers flipping through books, looking the title up on Amazon, and buying the book on their phone just before leaving the bookstore empty-handed.</p>

<p>But things have changed over the years. Amazon owns and operates several brick-and-mortar bookstores in cities around the country. They just bought Whole Foods. And so naturally they&rsquo;re getting concerned about showrooming, themselves. <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/06/19/amazon-plans-to-check-up-on-your-price-checks/">Lisa Vaas at Naked Security writes about a new patent from Amazon</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The patent, titled “Physical store online shopping control”, describes a system that would prevent customers from comparing prices in Amazon stores by watching any online activity conducted over its Wi-Fi network, detecting any information of interest and responding by sending the shopper to a completely different web page, or even blocking internet use altogether.</blockquote>

<p>With the help of our friends at Elliott Bay Book Company, we at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> were happy to <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/06/independent-bookstore-fan-showrooms-amazon-books/">encourage Allison Steiger become the first person in the world to showroom Amazon Books</a> back in 2015. If Amazon has their way, Steiger won&rsquo;t be a trend-setter.</p>
