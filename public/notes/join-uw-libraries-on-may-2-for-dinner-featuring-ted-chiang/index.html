<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1521520494674/Ted%20Chiang_150.jpg" alt="" /></p>Every year the University of Washington Libraries host Literary Voices, a dinner to support the Libraries and this year, to provide scholarships for its student staff — a lovely idea and one from which we all benefit. Each year the keynote address is stunning; this year, the featured guest is Ted Chiang. Chiang&rsquo;s writing brought a kind of imagination back to hard science fiction that a lot of readers had stopped expecting, and he&rsquo;s applied the same lens, terrifyingly, to <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/tedchiang/the-real-danger-to-civilization-isnt-ai-its-runaway?utm_term=.bu1EgJaa5B#.oeA21VOOAr">the giants of tech</a>. It&rsquo;s sure to be a fascinating speech.</p>

<p>But wait: as excited as we think you should be about seeing Chiang, your hosts for dinner deserve equal attention. Every table at the event is shepherded through the meal by a notable Seattle writer or Pacific Northwest writer: Claudia Castro Luna, Ross McMeekin, Ijeoma Oluo, and more.
