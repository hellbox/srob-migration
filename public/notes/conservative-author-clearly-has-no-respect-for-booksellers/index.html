<p>Just in case you weren&rsquo;t sure that <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/dinesh-dsouza-pleads-guilty-illegal-campaign-contribution-106882">convicted felon</a> and <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/disgraced-humiliated-dinesh-souza-pleads-probation-article-1.1927485">self-described &ldquo;disgraced&rdquo;</a> conservative attack dog Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza is a horrible person, look no further than his tweet from Sunday:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This argument is more relevant than ever as the media left tries to use <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Charlottesville?src=hash">#Charlottesville</a> to promote its Big Lies about fascism &amp; Nazism <a href="https://t.co/58uAfB2Tn0">pic.twitter.com/58uAfB2Tn0</a></p>&mdash; Dinesh D&#39;Souza (@DineshDSouza) <a href="https://twitter.com/DineshDSouza/status/896792320154099713">August 13, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Rather than be embarrassed about the subject matter of his new book, which tries to tie liberals to Nazism, D&rsquo;Souza is trying to profit off of the Charlottesville neo-Nazi rally.</p>

<p>As if to demonstrate what a bad thinker he is, D&rsquo;Souza covered the rest of a new arrival table with copies of his book in order to seem like a big deal. But he does a shit job of it — you can see the other books peeking out from underneath his — and you just know he didn&rsquo;t clean up after himself.</p>

<p>My favorite response to D&rsquo;Souza&rsquo;s tweet comes from Seattle author Adam Rakunas:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First person to send me a picture of my books stacked on top of Dinesh D&#39;Souza&#39;s at a bookstore gets a signed copy of LIKE A BOSS.</p>&mdash; Adam Rakunas (@rakdaddy) <a href="https://twitter.com/rakdaddy/status/896853414247751680">August 13, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>If you take Rakunas up on his offer, please remember to clean up after yourself. Don&rsquo;t be a D&rsquo;Souza. (And read <em>Like a Boss</em>, which is a wonderful book about labor unions in outer space.)</p>
