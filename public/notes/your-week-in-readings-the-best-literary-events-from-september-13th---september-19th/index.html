<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Monday September 18th: <em>The Twelve-Mile Straight</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
In case you weren’t already aware, the South is deeply fucked up. Aside from being badly beaten in the Civil War and never really getting over it, there’s a roots-deep racism that infects everything. Eleanor Henderson’s second novel is set in rural Georgia in the year 1930, which was an especially fucked up time.
