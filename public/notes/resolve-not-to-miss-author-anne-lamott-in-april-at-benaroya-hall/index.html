Sponsor Northwest Associated Arts is back this week to bring yet another great event to the attention of our readers. This time, it&rsquo;s a talk by <strong>Anne Lamott, coming up on April 8, 2018, at Benaroya Hall</strong>. It&rsquo;s sure to be packed, given how beloved Lamott is, and after her recent sold-out interview with Hillary Clinton at the Paramount Theater.</p>

<p>This will be a good evening for writers and readers both: for followers of Lamott&rsquo;s <em>Bird by Bird</em> writing guide (who are legion), and for lovers of her thoughtful, direct, and funny novels and essays. Start the year right by putting this on your calendar — you&rsquo;ll thank yourself later. Get more information <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/">on our sponsor’s page</a>, or buy tickets <a href="https://www.seattlesymphony.org/concerttickets/calendar/2017-2018/benaroyahall/anne-lamott">here</a>.</p>

<p>We just realized that both Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s day here at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> were sponsored by Northwest Associated Arts. Thank you for the making our holidays bright, NWAA! And a huge thank-you to all of our 2017 sponsors. We&rsquo;re grateful for each and every one of you.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in joining our community of sponsors (who are, really, the best) — and putting your book or event in front of our readers — check out <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">available dates in 2018</a>. We&rsquo;d love to meet you.
