<p class="noindent">*Love a little, die a little, and break the law. Trey Milligan did them all in one summer, and before his 14th birthday.* Sponsor Frank Murtaugh's debut novel, *Trey's Company*, was just released this month, and we've got a sneak peek to share with our readers — [the intro and whole first chapter](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) – perfect timing for your summer reading list. Baseball and coming of age are a common pairing; with his background in sports writing and intimate knowledge of the story's locale, Murtaugh brings something special to the mix.</p>
