<li>Scarecrow Video, the best damn video store in the whole damn world, announced yesterday that they&rsquo;re running a fundraiser book fair through the Northgate Barnes &amp; Noble. Between February 20th and February 27th, a portion of the sales from every customer who presents code 11800976 when they buy books in store or online will be donated to Scarecrow. To celebrate the book fair, I&rsquo;m giving a talk about books and adaptations titled &ldquo;The Book Was Better but the Movie Was Shorter&rdquo; on Saturday, February 20 at 1 pm. It&rsquo;s free. You should come. Scarecrow also made ths gorgeous poster to celebrate:</li>

<li><p>The <em>New York Times</em> has sued Powerhouse Books over the use of <em>New York Times</em> cover images in David Shields&rsquo; most recent book, <em>War Is Beautiful</em>. Many are questioning the wisdom of the <em>Times</em>&rsquo;s suit; for more information, read <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/01/26/new-york-times-copyright/">this report by Jeff John Roberts at <em>Fortune</em></a>.</p></li>

<li><p>The American Library Association has gone back to print on the wonderful David Bowie READ poster, which features Bowie, barefoot and dressed like a teenager, leaping into the air while reading <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>. The poster <a href="http://www.alastore.ala.org/detail.aspx?ID=11669">costs $18 and will be shipped in early February</a>, making it an ideal Valentine&rsquo;s Day gift.</p></li>

<li><p>This page from Octavia Butler&rsquo;s notebook made the rounds on Twitter yesterday, and it is incredible:</p></li>
