Classes include "[Promotion Fundamentals](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2922148)" and "[Business Fundamentals](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2922190)."

* Open Culture published [a neat look at what children's books were like in the Soviet Union](http://www.openculture.com/2017/04/read-vladimir-mayakovskys-childrens-book-whom-should-i-be.html).
