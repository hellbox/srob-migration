<p><em>Paris Review</em> editor and Farrar, Straus and Giroux editor Lorin Stein has stepped down amid charges of harassment. “At times in the past, I blurred the personal and the professional in ways that were, I now recognize, disrespectful of my colleagues and our contributors, and that made them feel uncomfortable or demeaned,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/books/lorin-stein-resigns-the-paris-review.html?smid=tw-share">the <em>New York Times</em> reports</a> Stein wrote in his resignation letter from the <em>Paris Review</em>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, author Jennifer Weiner attacked the framing of Stein in the <em>Times</em> story, and rightfully so:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NYT piece on Lorin Stein&#39;s resignation ID&#39;s him as &quot;champion of new talent, particularly women writers.&quot; In 2016, 35% of Paris Review bylines were by women. One out of 10 interviews was with a woman writer. <a href="https://t.co/zVLYlUxijQ">https://t.co/zVLYlUxijQ</a></p>&mdash; Jennifer Weiner (@jenniferweiner) <a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferweiner/status/938536890868912128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>And <em>New Yorker</em> staff writer Alexandra Schwartz just tweeted a link to the Stein story and left this comment:</p>

<p>Hopefully, we&rsquo;ll see more harassers in the publishing and magazine industries lose their power. We&rsquo;ve written many times on this site that the publishing industry is primarily made up of women, except for at the very highest posts: editors and publishers and executives still tend to be men, and that affects every other aspect of the industry. It&rsquo;s time to drive the harassers out and replace them all with women.</p>
