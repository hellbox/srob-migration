<p>like a heavy freight train<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is headed towards you,<br>
but you are running, tripping</p>

<p>over its tracks. You hope luck<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the taxi ready to pick you up,<br>
but luck’s the subway, luck’s</p>

<p>the bus with the accordion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;middle. You wait<br>
for luck, thought you bought</p>

<p>a ticket, thought the cab<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would stop. At the airport<br>
you hold a sign, <em>Welcome</em></p>

<p><em>Luck!</em> But everyone passes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;luck passes, doesn’t stop,<br>
and you are left</p>

<p>with your sign and a moment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of hope when you think<br>
you’ve found luck</p>

<p>in your pocket, but luck is down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the street in the Horseshoe<br>
Tavern, so you peek inside</p>

<p>and see it &mdash; luck, in its shy suit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drinking a beer<br>
with your best friend,</p>

<p>and they are taking selfies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with their smartphones,<br>
and you holding</p>

<p>your paper map,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hoping luck would travel<br>
long distances to find you.</p>
