<p>We get asked this a lot, and it is the nicest, most heartening compliment we can think of. We are not a non-profit, so we don&rsquo;t ask for your money. We&rsquo;re not interested in a Patreon or GoFundMe page. In fact, the best way for you to support us to be slightly selfish and take a bit of time for yourself each week. How?</p>

<p>Well, did you know that our sponsorships are not generic, horrible internet advertising? Do you know that preparing and presenting each sponsorship is an hours-long, hand-crafted process to create the very best reading experience possible for you? That the people who buy our sponsorships feel like you&rsquo;re really going to like what they have to say, and that you may like it so much that you&rsquo;ll want to buy their book, or attend their reading?</p>

<p class="pull-quote">All we ask is that you take a few minutes each week to look at our sponsorships.</p>

<p>We do have to say it pretty often, because we&rsquo;re all so used to advertising on the internet being so terrible. But: <em>All we ask is that you take a few minutes each week to look at our sponsorship</em>. Read the sample chapter and see if it&rsquo;s something that appeals to you. That&rsquo;s it! If you like it, of course we invite you to pick up a copy of the book, or attend the event. But really, all we ask, as your way of supporting us, is for you to look each week. If you&rsquo;ve done that, you are actively supporting us in very real way.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re more motivated, then if you&rsquo;re ever talking to a friend and they say something like &ldquo;<em>Wow, did you see that Elisa Chavez poem on the Seattle Review of Books? I love that they run poems like that.</em>&rdquo;, you should reply: &ldquo;<em>Did you visit their sponsor&rsquo;s page? Do it every week. It paid for Elisa&rsquo;s poem to appear on the site.</em>&ldquo;</p>

<p>Not to lay it on too thick, but it literally is true: your attention and time is all the support we desire, and it would mean so much to us if you could help us out in this way.</p>

<p><strong><em>But what if I <em>really</em> want to send you money?</em></strong></p>

<p class="noindent">We seriously get asked this. We're not making it up. And, finally, we have an answer: _you, too, can buy a sponsorship_! 

We'll give you a discount over our published rate, and you can tell us about a book you want people to know about. As long as you have no financial interest or connection to the author, we'll take your thoughts and write up a nice blurb, and get that book in front of our readers for a full week. You'll have given us some money, and directly paid for the content you see every day on the site.</p>

<p>And of course, if you have your own book or event to promote, our sponsorships are as popular as ever. <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">Take a look at the newly released block of dates</a>, and let us help you tell your story. We can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
