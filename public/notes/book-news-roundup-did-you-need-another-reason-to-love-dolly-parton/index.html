<li><p>Emerald City Comicon is coming this weekend! The fantastic <a href="https://seattle.curbed.com/maps/seattle-comic-book-shops">Sarah Anne Lloyd at Curbed</a> compiled a handy list of Seattle-area comics shops to visit over the weekend. I have to admit, I had never heard of Burien&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ancientcomics-278474455532743/">Ancient Comics</a> until I read this list and now I can&rsquo;t wait to check it out.</p></li>

<li><p>The Seattle Public Library&rsquo;s <a href="https://shelftalkblog.wordpress.com/2018/02/27/worldbuilding-in-comics/">Shelf Talk Blog</a> is celebrating ECCC with a list of worldbuilding comics, including Faith Erin Hicks&rsquo;s excellent Nameless City series.</p></li>

<li><p>Applications close tomorrow for <a href="https://www.clarionwest.org/workshops/summer/">Clarion West&rsquo;s summer workshops</a>. If you&rsquo;re an aspiring sci-fi writer, you should get involved with Clarion West; they&rsquo;re an amazing resource.</p></li>

<li><p>Ta-Nehisi Coates <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/02/we-who-love-america/553991/?utm_source=atltw">is writing a <em>Captain America</em> series</a>. The first issue will be published on July 4th.</p></li>

<li><p>Fantasy author Terry Goodkind became an internet villain this week when he <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/fantasy-author-terry-goodkind-wants-everyone-to-know-ho-1823323895">encouraged his fans to mock his most recent book cover</a>, which was illustrated by Bastien Lecouffe Deharme. I&rsquo;ve literally never heard of an author shitting on his own book cover in public. Goodkind is <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?742364-The-Sword-of-Truth-Just-how-bad-does-the-objectivism-propaganda-get">known as an Ayn Rand acolyte</a>; it&rsquo;s not too surprising that he has no idea how to act like a decent human being.</p></li>

<li><p>But let&rsquo;s not dwell on the horrible people in the world. Let&rsquo;s celebrate the truly great human beings out there, like Dolly Parton. Why am I talking about Dolly Parton on a book site? Because of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2018/02/27/dolly-parton-likes-to-give-away-books-she-just-donated-her-100-millionth/?utm_term=.e61095cde5d8">this story from the <em>Washington Post</em></a>: Parton just donated her hundred millionth book. Yes, her <strong>100,000,000th</strong> book.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Parton is the founder of Imagination Library, a nonprofit that started out donating books in Sevier County, Tenn., and grew into a million-book-a-month operation. Families who sign up receive a book per month from birth to kindergarten. The singer donated her organization’s 100 millionth book to the nation’s library on Tuesday.</blockquote>
