<p>This morning, <a href="http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2017/03/elliott-bay-book-company-friendly-buyer-found-for-capitol-hills-ford-building/">Capitol Hill Seattle&rsquo;s Kaylee Osowski reported</a> that the Elliott Bay Book Company&rsquo;s building has found a buyer. According to present Elliott Bay landlord Hunters Capital, the new landlord wants to keep the bookstore as a tenant. They have not yet revealed the identity of the prospective owner, but they call them &ldquo;local&rdquo; and &ldquo;family-owned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have every reason to believe those claims: Elliott Bay has a long-term lease for the space, and Hunters Capital specifically sought them out as tenants back when the store was based in Pioneer Square. In a time when no Seattle landmarks are safe from development, Osowski&rsquo;s report leaves me cautiously optimistic.</p>
