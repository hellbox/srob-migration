Zanadu Comics, the 41-year-old comics shop on 3rd Avenue downtown, has launched a [crowdfunding campaign on GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/zanadu-comics) to raise $80,000 to keep the lights on and the doors open. The shop cites "increased rent costs, and unfortunate city developments which includes a forced relocation due to building renovation late next year" as the reason for the campaign. It's especially heartwarming to see that Pike Place Market comics shop Golden Age Collectables, has donated $500 to the campaign, leaving a comment that "We're all in this together!"

In the last two decades, Zanadu has greatly expanded their independent and local comics selection, transforming from a pretty good spot to fill your weekly comics fix to a phenomenally well-stocked comics bookstore that I'd recommend to anyone. If you're allergic to crowdfunding campaigns, I'd urge you to drop by Zanadu for a visit, see what they've been up to lately, and show your support the old-fashioned way: by buying books off the shelves.
