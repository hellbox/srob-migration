DeFrees, who <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/13/madeline-defrees-1919-2015/">passed away in November</a>, was one of the very best poets our region had to offer.

closes out your week with a memoir by <strong>Katherine A. Hitchcock</strong>. Hitchcock was one of the very few women in Silicon Valley in the late 60s, 70s, and 80s, which means she helped computers transform from gigantic monsters to tiny little handheld time-sucking devices. Her memoir is titled <em>Atypical Girl Geek</em>.</p>
