        <p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1449291707771/db_sidebar1.jpg" alt="" /></p><strong>MONDAY</strong> Your week begins with a splash: author and artist <strong>Molly Crabapple</strong> reads at <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/molly-crabapple">Elliott Bay Book Company</a>. Crabapple’s <em>Drawing Blood</em> is a memoir about art, journalism, and upheaval. It’s an absolutely gorgeous (and, by all accounts, beautifully written) book.</p>

<p><strong>TUESDAY</strong> <a href="https://hugohouse.org/event/copper-canyon-press-holiday-party/">Hugo House</a> hosts <strong>the Copper Canyon Press holiday party</strong>. A bunch of Copper Canon poets including Dean Young and Deborah Landau will read new work, and Copper Canyon staffers will introduce you to poets and books that could change your life. (This is the publisher that Sherman Alexie once called the best poetry press in America, after all.) They’ll offer great gift suggestions, too!</p>

<p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong> The best-looking literary event of the night is at the <a href="http://www.spl.org/calendar-of-events#/?i=3">South Park Neighborhood Center</a>, where Seattle Public Library staffers will lead a book club discussion of the excellent comic book memoir <em>Marbles</em> by Ellen Forney, who is a Seattle-area treasure.</p>

<p><strong>THURSDAY</strong> <a href="http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=12&amp;evyear=2015&amp;eventid=2015120210160300&amp;pre=20151203&amp;pst=20151219">University Book Store</a> presents <strong>a Theo Chocolate and Coffee Tasting</strong>. There’ll be chocolate from Theo and coffee from Stumptown, along with signed copies of the <em>Theo Chocolate</em> cookbook. University Book Store does offer gift-wrapping, so this is a pretty easy way to score a good Christmas present and sneak some chocolate for yourself along the way.</p>

<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong> At the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/478308432340189/">Jack Straw Cultural Center</a> Jack Straw musicians <strong>Sharon Nyree Williams and Stephen Cohen</strong> will present new work. (Williams is also a storyteller and poet.) They’ll be joined by <strong>Anna Balint</strong>, who will present writers from the Recovery Café Safe Place Writing Circle. Balint is recording writers from the Recovery Café in a series of podcasts.</p>

<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong> It’s back to <a href="http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=12&amp;evyear=2015&amp;eventid=2015101411064800&amp;pre=20151211&amp;pst=20151227">University Book Store</a> for a special story time for kids, featuring treats, activities, and a visit from <strong>Santa Claus</strong>. (We have it on good authority that Mr. Claus will also pose for free photos with the kids, too.)</p>

<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong> We’re about to enter the two most reading-free weeks of the year, but this is a great way to close out 2015: Seattle poet <strong>Sarah Galvin</strong> presents a debut party for her new book <em>The Best Party of Our Lives</em> at <a href="https://hugohouse.org/event/book-launch-party-for-sarah-galvins-the-best-party-of-our-lives/">Hugo House</a>. This is a heartwarming collection of true stories about gay weddings. Galvin will be joined by couples from the book, and she’ll be interviewed onstage by Official Awesome Person David Schmader. This one is not to be missed.</p>
