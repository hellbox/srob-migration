<p>A little over a week ago, I moderated a panel on DIY culture for <a href="http://www.spl.org/locations/central-library/cen-events-at-the-central-library?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D126388054">Literary Career Day at the Seattle Public Library</a> downtown. The panel conversation was between myself, author Jeffrey Cheatham of <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/08/23/literary-event-of-the-week-seattle-urban-book-expo-at-washington-hall/">the Seattle Urban Book Expo</a>, and poet Rita Wirkala of <a href="http://www.seattleescribe.org/">Seattle Escribe</a>, but many of the dozens of young aspiring authors in the room took part in the conversation, which covered a wide array of topics.</p>

<p>Cheatham talked about his surprising success with the first Urban Book Expo, and his current attempts to turn the festival into &ldquo;an actual movement, a culture&rdquo; that represents writers and readers of color in Seattle. Wirkala discussed her history as a writer and a publisher and a published poet, as well as her work with Escribe, which she describes as an organization featuring readings, &ldquo;classes, and workshops for people who are writing&rdquo; in the Seattle area.</p>

<p>Most of the questions centered around how they manged to build a community, and how they kept the community going once it got started. Wirkala said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very good at finding people, but people have found me&rdquo; because she kept herself available as a publisher and a writer. Putting her name out and maintaining a presence in the city meant that like-minded could easily find her. As to maintaining the community, she attributes that to the &ldquo;self-generated energy&rdquo; created when &ldquo;you find people who are on the same wavelength and you fit with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cheatham said when he created the first Expo, he went on a listening tour. &ldquo;I listened to potential clients, because they&rsquo;ll tell you what you&rsquo;re looking for when they go to events,&rdquo; and then he took it upon himself to &ldquo;mold the show to fit what they wanted.&rdquo; And in order to more than double the size of the second Expo, he says he kept his ears open after the first one. &ldquo;I just listened to my customers. They told me what they wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Putting on an event is hard work, Cheatham notes, but if you listen and create a space, people &ldquo;as human beings want to find something they can call their own and work together on.&rdquo; Everyone&rsquo;s looking for their people, and they&rsquo;re willing to work to keep their community together.</p>

<p>Those groups are important for writers and publishers, Wirkala agreed, because &ldquo;when you write, or when you&rsquo;re engaging with work, you are too close to it as an idea. You always need somebody to help you&rdquo; gain some distance from the work. &ldquo;And you learn a lot from other people who are in the same field. That&rsquo;s really important,&rdquo; she added.</p>
