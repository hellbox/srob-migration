<p>This month&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books?logo&amp;utm_source=Humble+Bundle+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a0fd2ae9dc-Humble_Comics_Bundle_Forbidden&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_990b1b6399-a0fd2ae9dc-124184005&amp;mc_cid=a0fd2ae9dc&amp;mc_eid=514ad8e277">Humble Bundle features a whole passel of comics that have been banned</a>. (In case you&rsquo;re not familiar with the premise, the Humble Comics Bundle offers e-book editions of comics for a single low price, with a set-your-own-amount of that price going directly to charity.) A lot of the books in this Bundle are first volumes of great series — <em>Bone</em>, <em>Barefoot Gen</em> — and others are wonderful standalone comics from artists like Julie Doucet, Leah Hayes, Chester Brown, and Jim Woodring. At least one of them is outright terrible — Garth Ennis&rsquo;s <em>The Boys</em> was an awful dirty joke of a comic that unjustly tied up artist Darick Robertson for way, wayyyy too long. Still, if <em>The Boys</em> is the worst book in there, I like them odds.</p>
