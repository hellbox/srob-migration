<p>Alec Baldwin reads from his new memoir <em>Nevertheless</em> <a href="https://www.lectures.org/season/special_events.php?id=467">at the Paramount tonight</a>. It&rsquo;s sold out.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking about buying Baldwin&rsquo;s memoir, you should know that Baldwin is openly complaining about the job his editors did on the book. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/10/alec-baldwin-nevertheless-harpercollins-errors">Danuta Kean at <em>The Guardian</em> notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The 59-year-old actor has attacked his publisher HarperCollins, accusing the editors of poor proofreading. In his first post on a Facebook page set up to promote his new autobiography, *Nevertheless*, he claimed the published edition “contains SEVERAL typos and errors which I was more than a little surprised to see”.</blockquote>

<p>Editing is thankless work. Nobody ever comments on how <em>few</em> errors they find in a published book. They only complain when they <em>do</em> find errors. And that&rsquo;s basically an editor&rsquo;s lot in life: an editor&rsquo;s job is to fall on their sword when a book is released with an egregious error. Editors take the blame, absorb the insults, and then move on, knowing full well that they&rsquo;ll be responsible for any errors in the next project, too.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s be clear: a writer who publicly complains about his editors is <strong>a shit writer</strong>. I find it hard to believe that all those errors Baldwin complains about were introduced into the text during the editing process. If some of those typos and misstatements are his, then he is <strong>whining about someone not cleaning up the mess that he made</strong>. And that&rsquo;s never a good look.</p>

<p>Baldwin is a good actor. But I will never understand America&rsquo;s willingness to feign amnesia when it comes to Baldwin&rsquo;s character. This is a man who <a href="http://pagesix.com/2013/11/26/msnbc-fires-alec-baldwin/">says horrible things</a> to strangers. This is a man who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J0-ZatDHug">says horrible things to his own daughter</a>. This is a writer who pubicly derides his editors.</p>

<p>Why would I bother reading his memoirs — particularly memoirs that, by his own admission, are poorly written?  — just because he does a so-so Trump impression every couple of weeks on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>? Sorry, no. Life&rsquo;s too short.</p>
