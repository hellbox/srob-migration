<p><strong>MONDAY</strong> Our week begins with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/450452418475437/">Monorail Poetry Series at Fred Wildlife Refuge</a>.  Local author <strong>Tara Atkinson</strong>, who has a book coming out from Instant Future soon that I’m very excited to read, will be joined by Portland author <strong>Rachael Jensen</strong> and a Brooklyn writer with the unbelievable name of <strong>Sampson Starkweather</strong>. Jensen recently published her first chapbook with Snoot Books, and Starkweather has written a lot of books and also created “a multi-media website of pop/love GIF poems.”  Can one read a GIF at a reading? Maybe you’ll find out tonight.</p>

<p><strong>TUESDAY</strong> <a href="http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=10&amp;evyear=2015&amp;eventid=2015090213151000&amp;pre=20151005&amp;pst=20151021">University Book Store</a> hosts local sci-fi author <strong>Nancy Kress</strong>, who’ll be reading with <strong>Brenda Cooper</strong>. Kress is reading in support of a best-of collection of her work, and Cooper, who is also the Chief Information Officer for the City of Kirkland, reads from her new book <em>Edge of Dark</em>.</p>

<p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong> Head to the <a href="http://www.spl.org/calendar-of-events?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D116137777">Kangaroo and Kiwi pub in Ballard</a> for <strong>Librarian’s Revenge Trivia</strong>. As part of Seattle Public Library’s Booktoberfest promotion, librarians will be a-drinkin’ and a-trivia-in’ it up in an adults-only setting. This is such a ridiculously lovable idea.</p>

<p><strong>THURSDAY</strong> At a very special setting — “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/455211804682045/">the rooftop garden of the historic Union Arts Coop</a>, in the heart of Seattle&rsquo;s Capitol Hill” — contributors to literary magazines <em>Willow Springs</em> and <em>Los Angeles Review</em> will read prose and poetry. Booze will be served, too. Readers include <strong>Maggie MK Hess, Johnny Horton, Kate Lebo, Sam Ligon, Gary Lilley, Kirsten Lunstrum, Christine Robbins, and Philip Shaw</strong>. That’s a fine array of talent, from new-ish names to well-established local (and <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/exit-interview-talking-with-kate-lebo-about-why-she-left-seattle-for-spokane/">used-to-be-local</a>) writers.</p>

<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong> Cascade Writers, an organization that “ brings dozens of educational seminars and workshops to members of the public interested in writing and publishing,” will present a group reading at <a href="http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=10&amp;evyear=2015&amp;eventid=2015012012233500&amp;pre=20151008&amp;pst=20151024">University Book Store</a>. Tonight’s readers are local sci-fi writers  <strong>Ellen Datlow, Elliott Kay, and Kat Richardson</strong>, along with mystery author <strong>Tom Wright</strong>. It’s a genre-riffic kind of an evening.</p>

The name of that book? <em>Punch to Kill</em>. Delightful! This will be a great chance to hang out with the Seattle Comics Illuminati™ and maybe learn a thing or two about cartooning.</p>

<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong> As we prepare for the ginormous Lit Crawl happening on October 22nd, it’s probably smart to check out a smaller literary crawl just to stretch our reading muscles. Don’t want to pull an eye-hammy, after all. So it’s good news that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=525627827590575&amp;set=gm.514219755410687&amp;type=3&amp;theater">Rainier Valley Lit Crawl</a> is happening, with readers including <strong>Jeanine Walker</strong>, <strong>Greg Bem</strong>, <strong>Monique Franklin</strong>, <strong>Wendy Call</strong>, and <strong>Lindsey Walker</strong>.</p>
