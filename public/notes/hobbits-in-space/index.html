<p>We&rsquo;ve done our best to avoid Star Wars mania here on the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>, but even we can&rsquo;t ignore <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=T6Tft-LmkosC&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=hobbits%20in%20space%20jg%20ballard&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q=hobbits%20in%20space%20jg%20ballard&amp;f=false">this J.G. Ballard review</a> of the original movie from 1977.

Is Ballard fake-geek-girling Star Wars? Is he right? The happy answer is he&rsquo;s right, and he&rsquo;s wrong, and you&rsquo;re right, and you&rsquo;re wrong. It&rsquo;s possible for a universe to contain as many different opinions as there are people who have opinions. Sometimes it&rsquo;s interesting to read a contrarian take just to gather a new opinion about a time-honored piece of art.</p>
