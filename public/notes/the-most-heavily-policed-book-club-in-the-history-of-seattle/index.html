<p>Comedian and activist Brett Hamil notes that the Seattle Police Department came out for a discussion at the Beacon Hill Library:</p>

<p>Were all those police there just for a meeting of the Seattle Black Book Club? Apparently. Here&rsquo;s an account of what happened:</p>

<p>The Seattle Black Book Club describes themselves as &ldquo;a Black led community organizing group. We focus on the plight of the Black community to alleviate racial opression.We strive for Black liberation.&rdquo; You can read more about them on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Seattle-Black-Book-Club-1508678139444060/">their Facebook page</a>.</p>

<p>While I encourage everyone in the city to take an interest in literacy and book clubs, I&rsquo;m going to theorize that the Seattle Police Department&rsquo;s interest in the Seattle Black Book Club might not be of a strictly literary persuasion. Maybe they ought to back off and let people talk about what they want to talk about without escalating the situation?</p>

<p>And further: maybe, just maybe, we should allow book clubs to meet in Seattle without the kind of police coverage we ordinarily see for May Day marches?</p>
