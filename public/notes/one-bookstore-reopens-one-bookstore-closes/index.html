<li>Here&rsquo;s is a last-minute event that just delivered itself to our attention: Horizon Books, the used bookstore on Capitol Hill that recently closed, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/177174912829965/">is now having a grand re-opening sale</a> on Friday from 6 to 10 pm. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/177174912829965/">Facebook invite</a> says:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>Friends! Horizon Books is proud to re-open it's doors. We'd love to invite friends, community members and book lovers of all stripes to come and celebrate our re-opening party and sale. Come say hi to Don, Dave or Brandon, and see the new lay out.</p>

<p>For the one night only, everything under $20 will be %50 off, and include a huge range of free, dollar, $3 and $5 books, with the hope of clearing enough space to start shuffling off some dust, and clearing a few extra boxes out of the way.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Horizon will have a sale for the whole month of October, so drop by and see what they&rsquo;ve got onhand.</p></li>

<li><p>Remember: Seattle Mystery Bookshop is closing forever on Saturday, September 30th. Go and say goodbye to one of the best bookstore staffs that Seattle has ever seen. We&rsquo;ve been writing about <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/02/our-september-bookstore-of-the-month-is-seattle-mystery-bookshop/">Seattle Mystery Bookshop</a> since <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/09/the-recommendation-engine/">the very beginning of our site</a>, and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/23/the-staff-of-seattle-mystery-bookshop-recommends-mysteries-for-people-who-think-they-hate-mysteries/">we&rsquo;ve always been in awe of their bookselling ability</a>. I&rsquo;ll miss them very much.</p></li>
