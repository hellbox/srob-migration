<p>A name known all around Seattle&rsquo;s writing community, <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMountford" title="Peter Mountford (@PeterMountford) | Twitter">Peter Mountford</a> is the author of the novels <em>A Young Man&rsquo;s Guide to Late Capitalism</em>, which won the 2012 Washington State Book Award for fiction, and <em>The Dismal Science</em>, which in 2014 was a <em>New York Times</em> Editor&rsquo;s Choice. He&rsquo;s been published widely, from the <em>Atlantic</em>, to <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, to the <em>Sun</em>. Plus, if you&rsquo;ve seen a heroically amazing writer talk at Hugo House in the last few years, odds are that they appeared because Mountford asked them, in his capacity as events curator.</p>

<p>But of course, this recognition comes because of his phenomenal writing, which was the word Paul Constant used to sum up <em>The Dismal Science</em>. Mountford is a fine writer, and there is no doubt he&rsquo;ll put the time that money will buy him to very good use. Congratulations to him; he now joins the fine company of <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/08/anca-szil%C3%A1gyi-wins-the-first-gar-lasalle-storyteller-award/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Anca Szilágyi wins the first Gar LaSalle Storyteller Award">Anca Szilágyi</a> as the two recipients of this still-new, exciting prize.</p>
