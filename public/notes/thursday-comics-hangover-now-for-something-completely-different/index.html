<p>The first issue of <em>Now</em>, a quarterly comics anthology from Fantagraphics, begins with a text page that falls just shy of manifesto territory. It&rsquo;s by <em>Now</em> editor Eric Reynolds, and it argues that &ldquo;The anthology format can be an inherent force for good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reynolds makes a compelling argument. Anthologies are a great way for young cartoonists to get exposure and to experiment with styles without committing to a longform project. But nobody&rsquo;s really doing anthologies anymore. It&rsquo;s been years since Fantagraphics last dipped into the format with their gorgeous <em>Mome</em> series of bookshelf-ready paperbacks.</p>

<p>While still very substantial, <em>Now</em> seems more magazine-y than <em>Mome</em>, and that&rsquo;s a good thing: comics anthologies like this should feel of-the-moment and maybe not so permanent. And a good anthology needs a real reason to exist — a point to make, an argument to bear out, a fight to win.</p>

<p>So does <em>Now</em> live up to its name? Is it of the zeitgeist, or is it more of a nostalgia trip for a time when the comics industry was choking on anthologies?</p>

<p>The best comics in <em>Now</em> look like nothing else on the stands. The first page in the book, a strip called &ldquo;Constitutional&rdquo; by Sara Corbett, is absolutely gorgeous, a cross between a mannered kid&rsquo;s book from the 1950s and a deck of art deco playing cards. Nothing much happens in the six panels — an old woman and her cat go walking in a city park — but you can&rsquo;t stop staring at it, trying to figure out how a human hand could make something so eerily perfect.</p>

<p>Tobias Schalken&rsquo;s &ldquo;21 Positions&rdquo; feels like a magazine illustration from another time. It&rsquo;s just 21 borderless panels of a man and a woman dancing — or are they fighting, or are they fucking, or all three at once? — but as a comic it&rsquo;s something stripped down and raw and totemic. It&rsquo;s hard to pull your eyes from it.</p>

<p>A few comics veterans contribute pieces to <em>Now</em>. In &ldquo;Scorpio,&rdquo; Dash Shaw tells a story of a couple whose baby arrives on election night, 2016. Gabrielle Bell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dear Naked Guy In the Apartment Across from Mine Spread-Eagled &amp; Absent-mindedly Flicking his Penis While Watching TV&rdquo; is pretty much what it says in the title. (It begins, &ldquo;I know that you know that I know that you see me seeing you seeing me back.&rdquo;) Neither of these strips feel especially groundbreaking in relation to their respective artists&rsquo; careers, but they&rsquo;re both haunting little vignettes.</p>

<p>There are 17 different pieces in <em>Now</em>, and they&rsquo;re thematically all over the place. Sammy Harkam&rsquo;s &ldquo;I, Marlon&rdquo; imagines the plight of mid-career Marlon Brando as he luxuriates on his private island. &ldquo;Widening Horizon,&rdquo; by Malachi Ward and Matt Sheean, portrays a parallel history of space travel in a strip that might not be out of place in an especially adventurous issue of <em>Popular Mechanics</em>. Antoine Cossé&rsquo;s &ldquo;Statue&rdquo; is science fiction told in loopy, minimalist sketches. You never know what&rsquo;s going to come with the turn of a page, and every reader will find that some pieces of <em>Now</em> work better for them than others. (That&rsquo;s the whole point of an anthology.)</p>

<p>The most successful strips feel like they come from a slightly different  universe, one where the lush aesthetics of magazine illustration fused together with comics. Given that magazines are nearly dead now — <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/26/media/meredith-time/index.html">the Kochs will likely deliver the death blow</a> to the long-suffering medium — it&rsquo;s heartening to see the mannered and deeply designed illustrations from magazine culture&rsquo;s heyday take refuge in the (relative) safe harbor of comics, where cartooning has held sway for over a century.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been years since I&rsquo;ve seen someone in the comics world draw a line in the sand like this. Even Fantagraphics, which was practically a manifesto-producing factory back in the 1990s, hasn&rsquo;t made a declaration like <em>Now</em> in a while. Hopefully Reynolds will continue to explore this aesthetic in future issues of <em>Now</em>. This first issue proves he has the ambition, but it remains to be seen if the can turn that potential into a movement.</p>
