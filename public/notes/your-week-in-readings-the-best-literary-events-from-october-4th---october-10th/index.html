<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday, October 6: *From Here to Eternity* Reading**</h5></p>

<p>Caitlin Doughty is a mortician whose new book, <em>From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death</em>, “travels the world [from Bolivia to Japan to Indonesia] to discover how other cultures care for their dead.” Tonight, she’s joined by Seattle poet Sonya Vatomsky in an onstage conversation. She goes to Bolivia to see cigarette-smoking, wish-granting human skulls; to Japan to watch relatives of the deceased use chopsticks to pluck their loved ones’ bones from cremation ashes; to Indonesia to watch a man dress his grandfather’s mummified body.</p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Saturday, October 7: “Write-In”</strong></h5></p>
This confluence of the literary and the political (“politeracal?”) is a combination of readings by local writers, writing prompts, and joint writing exercise. These events are intended to celebrate the importance of free speech in these Trump-y times. This event is put on by Write Our Democracy, which used to be known by the much better name Writers Resist.

The best sci-fi bookstore in town brings a Tacoma author named Joseph Brassey to town with his brand-new space fantasy about knights in space and a magical gem.

The editors are joined by local superstar Ijeoma Oluo, who has a much-anticipated book coming out next year. Hopefully there will be several good Janet Jackson jokes to accompany all the good, thoughtful conversation.
