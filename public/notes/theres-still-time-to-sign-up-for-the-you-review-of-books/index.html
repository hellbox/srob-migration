<p>A quick reminder: you can <a href="https://hugohouse.org/store/class/the-you-review-of-books-paul-constant-and-martin-mcclellan/">still sign up for the 6-week book reviewing class</a> that Martin McClellan and I are teaching at Hugo House. We intend to discuss the purpose of book reviews, what it takes to make a book review into something more than just a GoodReads blurb or a boring plot synopsis, and the many different forms a book review can take. We&rsquo;re also going to get into some very important ideas: why responding to art is necessary, how to become a better reader, and why books are so important. We&rsquo;re very excited about this class, and <a href="https://hugohouse.org/store/class/the-you-review-of-books-paul-constant-and-martin-mcclellan/">we hope to see you there</a>.</p>
