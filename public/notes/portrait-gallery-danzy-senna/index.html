<p><p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday August 14th: <em>New People</em> Reading **</h5></p>
Danzy Senna is one of the very most interesting social writers the 21st century has yet to produce. Her long-awaited new novel, <em>New People</em>, is about a biracial couple who find themselves divided along lines that they don’t fully comprehend. Senna explodes American conceptions of class and race in ways that will make readers completely uncomfortable.</p>
