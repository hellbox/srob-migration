<p>Because there’s a sparrow outside that appears to be dying.<br>
Because I carry it with me, not the bird, but the emotion.<br>
Because its feathers are wet, almost drenched.<br>
Because not knowing what to do is my own purgatory.<br>
Because nothing in the house is sugarcoated.<br>
Because if you position yourself at the window you will see things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you don’t want to see.<br>
Because there is a forest of coyotes and we keep finding the bones of fawns.<br>
Because sorrow has embroidered itself beneath my ribs and I can’t unstitch it.<br>
Because even when I’m wrapped in a blanket, I’m not warm.<br>
Because we all keep dying.<br>
Because it’s really not a bird, but our country.<br>
Because the rain won’t stop, the rain won’t stop, the rain won’t stop.</p>
