<p>So as you probably know by now, writer Geoff Johns and artist Gary Frank are publishing a sequel to <em>Watchmen</em> titled <em>Doomsday Clock</em>. I don&rsquo;t really know what to say about the first issue of the book, except it is drenched in nostalgia. It&rsquo;s the kind of book that ten thousand teenage geeks dreamed they&rsquo;d get to write after they read <em>Watchmen</em> for the first time. <em>Doomsday Clock</em> reads like a cover version of <em>Watchmen</em>, a mimicking of Alan Moore&rsquo;s tone without the intellect to back it up.</p>

<p>At least the art is pretty. Frank is one of the best contemporary superhero artists, though it must be said that his work is changing in an unpleasant way with each passing year. The faces of his characters are getting tighter and more pinched; the poses seem more coiled with every new page. The looseness and excitement of his early work seems to be replaced with a dour and puckered over-rendering, and it&rsquo;s kind of sad to watch. I want to start a GoFundMe to send him on a nice relaxing vacation or something.</p>

<p>DC Comics published a prequel to <em>Doomsday Clock</em> in a Batman/Flash crossover called <em>The Button</em>, which is out in hardcover with a fancy cover that changes when you tilt the book. I enjoyed parts of <em>The Button</em> â€” writer Tom King&rsquo;s segments of the story, particularly a slow-motion battle between Batman and the ridiculous Flash villain Reverse-Flash, is laid out with King&rsquo;s customary attention to the rhythmic power of comics.</p>

<p>But <em>The Button</em> isn&rsquo;t just a callback to the <em>Watchmen</em>: it also homages the 1980s crossover <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em>, which suggests that perhaps there&rsquo;s even more of a callback to 1980s nostalgia in DC Comics today than <em>Doomsday Clock</em> lets on. It seems that every single book DC is publishing has to hearken back to its 45-year-old-male readership&rsquo;s childhoods in some form or another.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t really recommend either of these books, even though they&rsquo;re definitely appealing to a certain kind of reader. It doesn&rsquo;t really feel like there&rsquo;s anything new here, but unfortunately there are plenty of readers who might take that as a recommendation and not a criticism.</p>
