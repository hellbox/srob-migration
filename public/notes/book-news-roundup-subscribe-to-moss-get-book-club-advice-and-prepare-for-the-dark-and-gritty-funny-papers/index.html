<li><p>You have until Halloween to apply for the <a href="http://jackstraw.org/programs/asp/2017/2017_apps.shtml">Jack Straw Artist Residency programs</a>, which teach artists how to better use sound as a medium. Most writers are, sad to say, terrible readers of their own work. A program like Jack Straw immediately gives writers an edge over the competition by teaching them how to present their work in a reading, radio, or podcast setting. The writers program curator this year is poet and essayist Jourdan Imani Keith, who it is safe to say knows a thing or two about reading work aloud. <a href="http://jackstraw.org/programs/asp/2017/WP2017_application.shtml">Get your applications in by 5 pm on the 31st</a>.</p></li>

<blockquote>Penguin wrongly lost confidence in the power of the printed word and invested “unwisely” amid the rise of eBooks, one of the company’s bosses has admitted.</blockquote>

<li><p><a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/joeturrent/">This poem by Joe Turrent</a> is not extremely successful, but it is interesting: it&rsquo;s an erasure by way of Microsoft Word&rsquo;s &ldquo;track changes&rdquo; feature.</p></li>
