<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">_[Losswords. A game of literary portions](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2093152267/losswords-a-game-of-literary-portions)_. We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Colleen M, John S, &amp; Eric Z](  
http://losswords.com).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>The most fun you've ever had with Moby Dick, Alice in Wonderland, and Pride and Prejudice.!</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">What!? A game!?
</p>

<p>I like word games and games with book themes, and this one looks great. You take a book that is (hopefully) in the public domain and use that text to find words inside of other words. It&rsquo;s part <a href="http://www.tomphillips.co.uk/humument" title="Tom Phillips - A Humument"><em>Humument</em></a> and part word search, and will defiintely appeal to people who love anagrams and word puzzles.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">More word games! You can get a copy of the game for $10, which, for an iPhone game is not cheap, but you get your name in the app, and look at it this way: if the game doesn't get funded, you'll never get to play it. This one looks awfully fun, and the people making it have the experience making games (they made a fun tabletop card game called <a href="http://metaga.me" title="The Metagame: A card game for sharing opinions on almost everything.">Metagame</a> that's kind of 6-games-in-one &mdash; I played it at last year's <a href="http://2015.xoxofest.com" title="XOXO Festival">XOXO Festival</a>.)</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">They're 91% funded with 26 days to go, so it looks like they'll make it!</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
