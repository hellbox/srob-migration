<p class="noindent">Sponsor Entre Ríos Books is back to invite you to the launch celebration for a new book by San Francisco master Aaron Shurin — <em>Flowers &amp; Sky: Two Talks</em>. Hosted at Open Books, the event features a reading by Shurin and a special guest, Alex Vigue, a Washington native whose debut chapbook is forthcoming from Floating Bridge Press.</p>

<p>Entre Ríos has an excerpt from Shurin&#8217;s book and more information about the authors and the event on <a href="www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/">our sponsor page</a>. Check it out, then save room on your calendar for this Friday, November 3rd — it promises to be a great night. Many thanks to Entre Ríos Books for supporting the site and promoting the work of both writers!</p>
