<p><strong>MONDAY</strong> Your week of civic activism, Black Lives Matter, and a heavy dose of poetry begins at the <a href="http://www.spl.org/locations/fremont-branch/fre-events-at-this-branch?trumbaEmbed=eventid%3D117489919%26view%3Devent%26-childview%3D">Fremont branch of the Seattle Public Library</a> with Floating Bridge Press&rsquo;s quarterly reading series An Evening of Poetry. This is <strong>Elizabeth Austen</strong>’s last Seattle-area appearance in her capacity as Washington’s poet laureate. (<a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/07/spokane-poet-tod-marshall-is-washingtons-new-poet-laureate/">Read about our new poet laureate here</a>.) Go and show her some love for all the hard work she’s put in as the public face of poetry. Other readers include <strong>Angela Belcaster and Von Thompson</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>TUESDAY</strong> We have a real rarity tonight: I can’t decide between the two top readings, so I’m going to tell you about them both. First up, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/459990450852749/"><strong>Sara Brickman</strong> features at the Round at Fremont Abbey</a>. Brickman, a Seattle poet who headed east for graduate school, is making a rare local appearance with other poets, a cellist, and “live painters.” Brickman is a lively reader, and it’ll be good to catch up with her recent work.</p>

<p>Also tonight, <strong>Nick Licata</strong> debuts his new book <em>Becoming a Citizen Activist</em> at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/752408068197906/">Couth Buzzard Books</a>. I <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/how-nick-licata-won-seattle-politics/">reviewed this one last week</a>. Licata just left Seattle’s city council last week, and now he’s re-entering life as a private citizen. Be gentle with him.</p>

<p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong> <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/emily-johnston-drew-dillhunt-jeff-encke">Elliott Bay Book Company</a> hosts a launch party for Seattle poet <strong>Emily Johnston</strong>’s debut collection, <em>Her Animals</em>. She’ll be joined by <strong>Drew Dillhunt</strong>, the associate editor at *Her Animals*’s publisher, Hummingbird Press. Seems like a good way to introduce yourself to a Seattle-area small publisher and support Seattle poetry in one evening.</p>

<p><strong>THURSDAY</strong> It’s time again for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1008442805911637/">Margin Shift</a>, the Seattle poetry collective&rsquo;s reading series. Tonight’s readers are <strong>Eddie Kim</strong> from Seoul, Seattle poet <strong>Samar Abulhassan</strong>, and, up from LA, <strong>Cathy Linh Che</strong>. You won’t find a more geographically diverse bill in Seattle this week, and Margin Shift always puts on a good show.</p>

<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong> Tonight’s best event is a talk titled “Black Lives Matter in Hip-Hop” at <a href="https://townhallseattle.org/event/black-lives-matter-in-hip-hop/">Town Hall Seattle</a>. A panel of local musicians, including <strong>Wyking Garrett, Jace Ecaj, Nikkita Oliver, Suntonio Bandanaz, and Renaissance the Poet</strong>, will talk about gentrification in hip-hop and the local Black Lives Matter movement. This one is important.</p>

His newest book, <em>Finding Them Gone: Visiting China’s Poets of the Past</em>, is a photo-filled travelogue from Pine’s monthlong trip to China, during which he tried to learn more about the history of Chinese poetry.</p>

<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong> <a href="http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=01&amp;evyear=2016&amp;eventid=2015110516084300&amp;pre=20160108&amp;pst=20160124">University Book Store</a> closes out our week with  “<strong>Cindy Safronoff</strong>&rsquo;s comparative biography of late 19th century feminist activists Mary Baker Eddy and Victoria Claflin Woodhull.&rdquo; Eddy believed in marriage as an institution. Woodhull was a proponent of free love. They often disagreed. Passionately. The book is titled <em>Crossing Swords: Mary Baker Eddy vs. Victoria Claflin Woodhull and the Battle for the Soul of Marriage</em>, and it sounds totally fascinating.</p>
