A million thanks to Arundel and Chatwin Books for returning to sponsor the site this week and for tipping us (and you) off to their holiday party, coming up this Friday. As always, the celebration is shaping up to be something special, particularly this year&rsquo;s featured guest: Carl Montford, well-known local wood engraver and extraordinary artist and craftsman.</p>

<p>Montford&rsquo;s prints are on display all month at Arundel&rsquo;s Pioneer Square shop, and you should absolutely stop in and see them (and get some Christmas shopping done while you&rsquo;re there; originals are shockingly affordable). But there&rsquo;s only one night on which you can also meet Montford in person, talk to him about his craft, and hear him play a little music as well. Books, music, art, and wine — don&rsquo;t wait for an invitation; <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/">come out this Friday, December 15, and celebrate the season in true Northwest style</a>.</p>

<p>Sponsors like Arundel Books make the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> possible — and it&rsquo;s part of our commitment to <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">make internet advertising 100% less terrible</a>. We&rsquo;d love to feature your book, event, or opportunity on the site. <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">Reserve a date now</a>.</p>
