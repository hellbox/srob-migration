        <p><em>Houstonia</em> magazine <a href="http://www.houstoniamag.com/articles/2015/7/20/the-case-of-the-missing-magazine-2015">responds perfectly</a> to racist readers who complained about an advertisement depicting a mixed-race family. Sometimes the customer is not right. Sometimes the customer is a bigot. In times like that, it&rsquo;s okay to call them out on their bigotry, and to tell them they are not welcome to read the publication anymore. The quality of your readers definitely makes a statement about your publication. In fact, it says a lot more about your publication than the quantity of readers.</p>
