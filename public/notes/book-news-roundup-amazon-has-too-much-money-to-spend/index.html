<li><p>Congratulations to Tim Lennon, who <a href="http://artbeat.seattle.gov/2017/11/13/first-executive-director-of-langston-hired/">was announced as</a> the Executive Director of LANGSTON, a new Seattle nonprofit that will &ldquo;guide programming intended to strengthen and advance community through Black arts and culture.&rdquo; I worked with Lennon at Elliott Bay Book Company right after he moved to town in 2001 and we&rsquo;ve been friends ever since, so I can&rsquo;t claim any objectivity, but his career in the years since — at One Reel, heading up Vera Project, working at the Office of Arts &amp; Culture — demonstrates that he&rsquo;ll be excellent at this. I look forward to seeing what LANGSTON contributes to Seattle&rsquo;s arts and literary communities. Lennon starts in January of next year. And if this post didn&rsquo;t have enough conflict-of-interest in it for you already, the best account in local media of Lennon&rsquo;s new job is <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/theater/a-new-leader-for-langston-tim-lennon/?utm_source=RSS&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=RSS_brendan-kiley">from my old associate Brendan Kiley at the <em>Seattle Times</em></a>.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/cali-kopczick-chin-music-press/"><em>Kirkus</em> interviewed Chin Music Press editor Cali Kopczick</a> about the trends she&rsquo;s spotted in publishing, what manuscripts she&rsquo;d never like to see again, and what&rsquo;s unique about Seattle&rsquo;s Chin Music.</p></li>

<li><p>Yesterday, Amazon&rsquo;s television division <a href="http://deadline.com/2017/11/amazon-the-lord-of-the-rings-tv-series-multi-season-commitment-1202207065/">paid a crazy amount of money</a> to make a Lord of the Rings prequel TV show. There&rsquo;s not much information about this, but the deal is so huge that it seems to be tempting fate:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>In its quest to launch a hit fantasy series of the Game of Thrones caliber, Amazon has closed a massive deal — said to be close to $250 million — to acquire global TV rights to The Lord of the Rings, based on the fantasy novels by J.R.R. Tolkien. The streaming service has given a multi-season commitment to a LOTR series in the pact, which also includes a potential spinoff series.</blockquote>

<li><p>I dunno about you, but when I see a quarter-of-a-billion deal with multi-season franchise commitments, I think of the <a href="https://newswire.net/newsroom/news/00098592-universal-s-dark-universe-cancelled.html">recent collapse of Universal&rsquo;s awful &ldquo;Dark Universe&rdquo; megafranchise</a>, and then I think of an old cliche about counting baby chicks before they hatch. And then I think of all the people living under bridges in this city and I start to feel queasy.</p></li>

<li><p>The comics industry is going through its own sexual harassment crisis, and <a href="http://www.comicsbeat.com/the-week-in-harassment-news-and-analysis/">Heidi MacDonald at the Beat</a> has been keeping good track of it all. Hopefully when we get to the other side of all this and the predators have been shaken out, we&rsquo;ll see a more inclusive, less white-male-centric comics industry.</p></li>

<li><p>And if you think the children&rsquo;s book industry is free from sexual harassment, you should read this thread:</p></li>
