      <div class="content">
        <p>Just last week, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/07/25/heres-what-vlad-from-third-place-books-is-most-looking-forward-to-this-fall/">we told you</a> that booksellers around Seattle were buzzing about Colson Whitehead&rsquo;s upcoming novel <em>Underground Railroad</em>. We quoted Vlad from Third Place Books, who praised &ldquo;Whitehead’s unflinching exploration of the various manifestations of the economics of slavery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today, Oprah <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2016/08/02/oprahs-book-club-back-underground-railroad/87946160/">added her approval</a> to the chorus of booksellers and librarians by adding the novel to her Oprah&rsquo;s Book Club label. &ldquo;The September issue of <em>O, The Oprah Magazine</em> (available Aug. 9) will feature the former talk-show queen&rsquo;s interview with Whitehead,&rdquo; <em>USA Today</em> reports.</p>

<p>This is great news for Colson Whitehead — a fabulous novelist who has never quite garnered the appreciation that he deserves, in part because he&rsquo;s such a fearless experimenter. No one of his books is like any other of his books: his debut novel <em>The Intuitionist</em> is a sci-fi thriller; <em>John Henry Days</em> is a big novel of ideas about the distinctly American myth of John Henry; <em>Apex Hides the Hurt</em> is a short, satirical novel in the style of Heller; <em>Zone One</em> is a zombie novel; <em>Sag Harbor</em> is a quiet, semiautobiographical story. Hopefully the Oprah acclaim will propel some of those other books to the top of reading piles and bestseller lists. Whitehead is the real deal — a novelist with an incredible body of work who puts art before personality — and he deserves every ounce of attention he&rsquo;s getting today.</p>
