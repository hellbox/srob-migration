<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday, November 9th: *Images of the West* Reading **</h5></p>
Down from Edmonds, photographer Randall Hodges shares photographs he has taken while wandering around the western portion of North America. Hodges will share tricks of the trade and explain why the west is his muse, and not the east. (Though that last one is pretty obvious to anyone who lives in Seattle: the west is dramatic and beautiful; the east is worn-down and exhausted.)

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday, November 10th:  *Fresh Complaint* Reading**</h5></p>
Jeffrey Eugenides is a stone-cold genius writer of novels. If you haven’t read *Middlesex*, you’re missing one of the finest American novels of the last twenty years; you’ll likely be hooked from the very first description of a fire tearing along a waterfront. Tonight, Eugenides breaks a long silence with a short story collection titled *Fresh Complaint*. He appears in conversation with Mary Ann Gwinn, who is no longer the *Seattle Times* book editor but who is still one of the city’s foremost literary experts.
