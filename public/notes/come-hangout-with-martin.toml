Last March, I ran [a successful Kickstarter to print my first novel, _California Four O'Clock_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hellbox/california-four-oclock-a-novel-about-the-lore-of-p). Kickstarter asked me if I'd take part in their series "Creator Hangouts", so today at 10 a.m. PST, I'll be doing just that. 

[Tune in at Google+ to take part](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/c0d6cvie7bq46sl8idb933co408). I'll be taking questions on the Kickstarter, _The Seattle Review of Books_, and anything else people want to discuss. Come and join!
