<p class="noindent">_The Seattle Review of Books_ has donated our sponsorship slot this week to encourage our readers to donate to the [ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/secure/become-freedom-fighter-join-aclu?s_src=UNW170001C00&alt_src=UNV170001C00&ms=web_menu_join). Just the few first days of the Trump administration were enough to tell us that we're going to need as many hands on deck as possible to fight him.</p>

<p>That means lawsuits, and challenging him in court. That means the ACLU is going to be vital to American freedom in the years to come. Please consider donating, or becoming a member of the ACLU.</p>
