<li>The children&rsquo;s book world is in turmoil right now over <a href="http://jewcy.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/childrens-book-german-suffering-wwii">a controversial new book for kids that focuses on German suffering during World War II</a>. Gabriela Geselowitz at Jewcy first notes the similarity to <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-idea-of-freedom-might-be-too-great-a-temptation-for-them-to-resist/">the kid&rsquo;s book from earlier this year which made light of slavery</a>, and then she writes:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Part of what is disturbing about the reception of the book is the unexplored idea of the motherâ€™s brief attempt to seat the slave laborers at the kitchen table as a great act of bravery and resistance, a sufficient antidote to the evil which is not even alluded to in the rest of the story.</blockquote>

No other industry builds their entire business model on the idea that customers pre-order their products, sight unseen. Books can live and die before readers even get to check out the first issue. There must be a better way to run the industry, right?</p></li>
