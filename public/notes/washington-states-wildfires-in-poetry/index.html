<p>Even though Seattle is happily back to its normal grey drizzle, we can&rsquo;t forget that the eastern half of Washington is currently battling the worst wildfires in state history. We&rsquo;ve already looked at how <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/28/washington-bookstores-survive-wildfires/">booksellers are surviving</a> the fires, but here&rsquo;s a project that&rsquo;s worthy of your attention: every other day, Washington state Poet Laureate Elizabeth Austen will <a href="http://wapoetlaureate.org/">publish a poem</a> relating to the wildfires. Yesterday, she published a beautiful poem by William Stafford about the Tillamook Burn. Last week, she ran <a href="http://wapoetlaureate.org/2015/08/28/endless-summer-by-kelli-russell-agodon/">a poem called &ldquo;Endless Summer&rdquo;</a> by <em>SRoB</em> contributor <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/kelli-russell-agodon/">Kelli Russell Agodon</a>.</p>

<p>Some of you may be wondering what poems have to do with wildfires. The answer is that poetry has to do with everything; Austen is raising awareness of a life-or-death issue in her capacity as our Poet Laureate. She is doing, in short, exactly what she should be doing: applying her mind to the problem and helping the public interpret the news, to give an unthinkable disaster a more human scale.</p>
