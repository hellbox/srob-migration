<p>Over the weekend, Spokane author Sharma Shields and Seattle authors Erik Larson and Jessixa Bagley won big at the Washington State Book Awards. St. Louis poet Carl Phillips, who was <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/09/19/why-does-carl-phillips-need-the-washington-state-book-award/">born in Washington but has not lived in Washington state for decades</a>, also won. (Here&rsquo;s hoping the Washington Center for the Book at the Seattle Public Library updates the rules to ensure to favor Washington writers in the future.) <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/dead-wake-sasquatch-hunters-almanac-top-washington-state-book-awards/">Moira Macdonald at the <em>Seattle Times</em></a> has a list of all the winners.</p>
