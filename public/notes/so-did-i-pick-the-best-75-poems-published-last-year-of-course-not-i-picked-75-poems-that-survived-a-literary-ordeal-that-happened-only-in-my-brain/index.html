<p>On <a href="http://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/2015/09/like-most-every-poet-i-have-viewed-the-publication-of-each-years-best-american-poetry-with-happiness-i-love-that-poem-je-1.html">the Best American Poetry blog</a>, Sherman Alexie explains the process of guest-editing <em>Best American Poetry 2015</em>. He also addresses a controversy that&rsquo;s swirling around the book:</p>

<blockquote>I chose a strange and funny and rueful poem written by Yi-Fen Chou, which turns out to be a Chinese pseudonym used by a white male poet named Michael Derrick Hudson as a means of subverting what he believes to be a politically correct poetry business.</blockquote>

<p>Alexie talks about the process of selection, how he felt when he found out Yi-Fen Chou was a ruse, and why you&rsquo;ll still find the controversial poem in the book when it&rsquo;s published this fall. Alexie is taking a lot of heat for this decision, but you can&rsquo;t accuse him of obfuscating the process. His transparency in the face of this controversy — did poetry <em>really</em> need its own Hugo Awards-style mess? — is to be commended, even if you disagree with his decision.</p>

<p>And if you&rsquo;re a white male writer who is complaining about political correctness as a roadblock to your success, let this white male offer you a piece of advice: putting on another culture like a Halloween costume is not going to win you friends or fans. It&rsquo;s not going to prove a point. It&rsquo;s just going to make people furious at you, and rightfully so. And in the years and decades to come if you&rsquo;re ever remembered at all, it will be as the white male writer who pretended to be another race because he was a total asshole and on the wrong side of history. That&rsquo;s not a legacy, it&rsquo;s just a stinkbomb tossed into a room full of unsuspecting and well-intentioned people.</p>
