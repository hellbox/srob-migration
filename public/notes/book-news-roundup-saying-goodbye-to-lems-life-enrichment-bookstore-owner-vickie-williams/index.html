<li><p>Seattle Public Library&rsquo;s own David Wright wrote about the best/worst storytime ever <a href="http://lithub.com/librarians-of-the-21st-century-worst-story-time-ever-or-best/">over at Literary Hub</a>:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>When we opened our new downtown library with its large auditorium, back in 2004, I stood looking up at the empty seats and immediately felt that I needed to do a story time for adults there. Ours is one of the most childless cities in the country. Every library has children’s story time. Don’t adults deserve the same? Our need for story doesn’t go away at a certain age. Not surprisingly, turnout has been good for over a decade, and spinoff programs such as ghost storytelling in bars are standing room only. Last year, I added another narrative element by pairing story readings with screenings of film adaptations in a program I called Page to Screen.</blockquote>
