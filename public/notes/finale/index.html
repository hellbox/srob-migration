<p>It was hours and then the end is almost over.<br>
Velvet curtains all in rustle at the borders<br>
of the stage. Our eyes are dry, our knees numb,</p>

<p>our temples dull. Nothing is left to be begun:<br>
No tearing at the breasts of hairdoed birds,<br>
no smooth unscrolling of the Italian words</p>

<p>for <em>love</em> and <em>loss</em>. No garden froth, no castle wall<br>
to knock the sword against, no impossible<br>
extension of the slenderest ankle in its arc.</p>

<p>The lights on stage will dim and so we feel the dark, <br>
feel how the real &mdash; real sex, real pain, real meat &mdash;<br>
awaits us in the car. We feel the purses at our feet.</p>

<p>Onstage the voices call but we are half-<br>
way back to home by now, numbering the claps,<br>
saying the bravos that we hope are minimum.</p>

<p>We are adding up the babysitter&rsquo;s sum.<br>
We are watching for the last breath of the lover.<br>
We forget to be the ones who don&rsquo;t recover.</p>
