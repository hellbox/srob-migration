<p>If you, like tens of thousands of others, loved <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/01/03/revenge/">Elisa Chavez&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; when it appeared on the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> in January</a>, you should know that a broadside of the poem is <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/523725611/letterpress-broadside-revenge-by-elisa">now available on Etsy</a>. It costs $35, and all proceeds benefit the <a href="https://www.rescue.org/">International Rescue Committee</a>. It looks absolutely gorgeous, too.</p>
