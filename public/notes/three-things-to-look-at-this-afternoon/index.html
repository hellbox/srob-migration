<li><p>The (I guess NSFW, maybe?) photograph of <a href="http://thenewpostliterate.blogspot.com/2016/03/naked-language-mural-by-vladimiro.html">the &ldquo;naked language mural&rdquo; by artist Vladimiro Lunardon up at The New Post-Literate</a> is a thing of beauty. It&rsquo;s exactly what reading great literature feels like to me. Lunardon&rsquo;s art employs <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Vladimiro-lunardon-146087905413487/photos_stream">lots of writing-like imagery</a>, and some of it is really quite beautiful.</p></li>

<li><p>Chip Zdarsky&rsquo;s <a href="http://zdarsky.tumblr.com/post/141274340631/huh-who-knew">addition to the conclusion of <em>Frankenstein</em></a> solves one of literature&rsquo;s greatest problems.</p></li>
