Applications for 2018 Mineral School residencies (and the six fellowships available to help cover costs) are due on February 15. Writers and visual artists who need a place to start something new or finish something big should leap on this: Mineral School is young, but rapidly gaining an ardent following. The setting is quirky and idyllic, the food is good, and the company is exceptional — just ask Clare Johnson, whose last round-up of Post-It Note art on this site <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2018/01/05/decembers-post-it-note-art-from-instagram/">documented her experience at the program</a>.</p>
