<blockquote><p>Seats on 42nd Street subway Shuttle cars are [wrapped with symbols from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan](http://gothamist.com/2015/11/23/nazi_mta_subway_castle.php), intended to carry commuters into the alternate history of the Amazon TV series, *The Man in the High Castle*, in which the Axis Powers were victorious.</p>
