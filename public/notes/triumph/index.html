<p>I always forget who lives<br>
in my city.<br>
No comment on them &mdash;<br>
my memory’s bad.<br>
Or good<br>
for certain things.<br>
Like faces.<br>
Or items<br>
on a grocery list.<br>
Or the precise feelings<br>
a book produced<br>
in me once,<br>
although perhaps not<br>
its phrases or ideas.<br>
But people, you<br>
lovely impenetrables,<br>
too often I forget<br>
you exist.<br>
I don’t find it hard<br>
to reach out to you<br>
in moments &mdash;<br>
to recognize<br>
your flesh and flutter<br>
as mine.<br>
Still, the grocery<br>
list lengthens.<br>
Somewhere<br>
a party commences.<br>
It occurs to me<br>
I store a vast reserve<br>
of sympathy for myself<br>
inside myself.<br>
I don’t know whether<br>
this is a triumph<br>
of compassion or greed<br>
but I guard it like passion<br>
or grief.</p>
