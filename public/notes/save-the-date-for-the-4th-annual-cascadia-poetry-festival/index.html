<p>Now that fall has arrived in Seattle again — I type this while wearing the first sweater of the season — it&rsquo;s time to start planning your literary autumn. And there&rsquo;s a lot going on this year; your schedule will be packed before you know it.</p>

<p>So I just wanted to draw your attention to a special event: <a href="http://cascadiapoetryfestival.org/">The Cascadia Poetry Festival happens from November 3rd to November 6th</a> at the Spring Street Center. There will be readings, workshops, a book fair, and plenty of discussions about Cascadian literature, Cascadian poetic identity, and the importance of regionalism in the age of the internet. Some other special guests and events:</p>

<blockquote>Daphne Marlatt, Brenda Hillman, Sam Hamill, Marilyn Stablein, Judith Roche, Janie Miller and Peter Munro are among the confirmed performers. The festival will honor the memory of Denise Levertov and there will be a ritual walk to her grave on Sunday morning.</blockquote>

<p>I wrote about the importance of Denise Levertov to Seattle (and vice versa) <a href="http://lithub.com/denise-levertov/">for Literary Hub</a>. This celebration of her memory alone makes the Festival a must-attend event. Visit <a href="http://cascadiapoetryfestival.org/">Cascadiapoetryfestival.org</a> for more details.</p>
