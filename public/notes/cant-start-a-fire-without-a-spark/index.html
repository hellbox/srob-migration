<p>Did you know that the good folks at Humanities Washington publish a magazine called <em>Spark</em>? It&rsquo;s true! and <a href="https://www.humanities.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/HW_Spark_FallWinter2017_LO.pdf">the latest issue of <em>Spark</em> is now online in PDF form</a>. In this issue, you&rsquo;ll find a new poem from Sherman Alexie, a history of Washington literature as told in 14 books, a discussion of the long history of fake news, and a new short story by Spokane author Jess Walter. It has a fantastic first sentence:</p>

<blockquote>Your goddam kids wanna send *you* to the booby hatch?</blockquote>
