<p>This week I want to talk about a book that isn&rsquo;t actually a comic book, but which wouldn&rsquo;t exist without comics. Catherynne M. Valenti&rsquo;s young adult short story collection <em>The Refrigerator Monologues</em> is an attempt to give voice to the often-neglected women who serve in supporting roles in superhero comics.</p>

<p><em>Refrigerator</em> is structurally a riff on the <em>Vagina Monologues</em> with a superhero twist, and Valenti clearly knows her source material. The name comes from a superhero comic trope known as &ldquo;fridging,&rdquo; in which a love interest&rsquo;s grisly death serves no greater purpose than really pissing off a hero, thereby giving him the motivation he needs to defeat the villain of the story. The book examines, satirizes, and deepens the cliches that women must endure in comics.</p>

<p>These are riffs on Spider-Man&rsquo;s first girlfriend Gwen Stacy (thrown off a bridge to her death by the Green Goblin) and Cyclops&rsquo;s girlfriend Phoenix (committed suicide after being tempted to the dark side by a cosmic being) and the Joker&rsquo;s girlfriend Harley Quinn (not dead, but often reduced to a punchline about codependency.) Valenti gets deep into the characters&rsquo; heads, adding motivations and complex emotional responses to the crude stories mapped out in superhero comics of the past.</p>

<p>The framing story in <em>Refrigerator</em>, a club in the afterlife where wronged women can gather and tell their stories, doesn&rsquo;t quite go anywhere. And the book feels a little slight; it could use one or two more stories. But Valenti definitely ties together a thesis here, and she vindicates a whole rainbow of characters who have only gotten short shrift for the last fifty years. Hopefully next, she&rsquo;ll write a comic that puts these women front and center â€” without the men around to ruin everything.</p>
