<p>Cecilia Woloch, whose most recent poetry collection was from Washington publisher <a href="http://www.twosylviaspress.com/index.html">Two Sylvias Press</a>, has a wonderful poem in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/07/magazine/wild-common-prayer-cecilia-woloch.html?_r=0"><em>New York Times</em></a> today. &ldquo;Wild Common Prayer&rdquo; is a poem with long, luxurious lines about an encounter with a familiar friend in uncertain territory. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a lunchtime investigation.</p>
