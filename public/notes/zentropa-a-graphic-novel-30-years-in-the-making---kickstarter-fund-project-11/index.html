<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Zentropa, a Graphic Novel 30 years in the making_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/194503169/zentropa-a-graphic-novel-30-years-in-the-making?ref=nav_search). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[John Mahoney](http://mahoneyart.carbonmade.com).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>A new Si-Fi epic in the tradition of the old Heavy Metal Magazine comic strips.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    First, the artwork is crazy. It really is in that tradition of Heavy Metal (the magazine), which despite its rampant over-sexualizing of women characters, published some freaky, freaky shit. Comics that would take you places no others did, that would visualize strange mechanisms, and creatures, and nightmare situations that hung on a hybrid web of fear and wicked-cool visuals.
</p>

<p>Mahoney&rsquo;s work certainly recalls that. He&rsquo;s a professional artist, so there&rsquo;s not much of a surprise there. But what is more surprsising is that he&rsquo;s started and given up on making comics many times in his life. It was only after having a large life-threatening tumor removed that he decided to knuckle down and make his dream project.</p>

<p>And his dream project, inspired by his hospital stay, sounds like it contains nightmares.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want one of those books you can look at, and look at, and look at, getting lost in the line work and thinking about how cool it is, then this book is for you. The thing is, this style is just not seen anymore in the comics world. It's nice to see something so starkly different.</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">Great. 18 days to go, and they've raised about 230% of their goal. Don't give because you feel guilty, give because you want a copy.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
