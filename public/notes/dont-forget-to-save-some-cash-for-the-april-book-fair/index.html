<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that this Saturday, from noon to 4 pm, the APRIL Book Fair is happening at Hugo House. 27 local publishers — including the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> — will have tables full of merchandise for sale. <a href="http://www.aprilfestival.com/expo/">Find a full list of vendors right here</a>.</p>

<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is this: if you&rsquo;re on a budget, and you&rsquo;re thinking about hitting the bars on a weeknight this week, maybe stay home and invest in some literature this weekend. You&rsquo;ll thank me later.</p>
