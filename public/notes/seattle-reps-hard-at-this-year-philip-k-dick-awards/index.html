<p>This year&rsquo;s Philip K. Dick Awards shortlist <a href="http://www.philipkdickaward.org/">was released last week</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>EDGE OF DARK by Brenda Cooper (Pyr)</p>
<p>AFTER THE SAUCERS LANDED by Douglas Lain (Night Shade Books)</p>
<p>(R)EVOLUTION by PJ Manney (47North)</p>
<p>APEX by Ramez Naam (Angry Robot Books)</p>
<p>WINDSWEPT by Adam Rakunas (Angry Robot Books)</p>
<p>ARCHANGEL by Marguerite Reed (Arche Press)</p></blockquote>

<p>On that list, Brenda Cooper lives in Kirkland, Ramez Naam is a Seattle author, and Adam Rakunas moved to Seattle last year. (<a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/state-of-the-union/">Read my review of <em>Windswept</em> here</a>.) This is a pretty strong showing for local sci-fi. It&rsquo;s especially heartening that it&rsquo;s the Dick Awards, too, because they are, in my opinion, the best of the science fiction awards, favoring substance over style.</p>

<p>The winner of the Philip K. Dick Award will be announced at Norwescon in SeaTac on Friday, March 25th. Here&rsquo;s hoping a local author brings it home.</p>
