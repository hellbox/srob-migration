<p>Hugo House has published a <a href="https://hugohouse.org/wp-content/uploads/hugo/2016/04/Moving-FAQ.pdf">(PDF) Frequently Asked Questions</a> sheet explaining what their last month of operations in the Capitol Hill building will be like. There will be a large party on May 7th in which people will be invited to write on the walls of the House, and there will be a Literary Series event on the 20th — the theme is &ldquo;The Writing on the Wall,&rdquo; cleverly enough — that is slated to be the final event. If you&rsquo;d like to learn about what the Hugo House will look like on First Hill, please <a href="https://hugohouse.org/wp-content/uploads/hugo/2016/04/Moving-FAQ.pdf">check out the FAQ</a>. They&rsquo;re doing a good job of being very transparent about this.</p>
