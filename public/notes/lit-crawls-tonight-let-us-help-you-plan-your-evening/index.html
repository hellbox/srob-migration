<p>The Seattle edition of Lit Crawl is finally here! It starts at 6 pm and continues through 8:45 (although the afterparty at Fred Wildlife Refuge will likely continue until the booze runs dry.) You can <a href="http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-map">find a map and schedule here</a>.</p>

<p>But if I may be so bold as to offer you some advice: <strong>don&rsquo;t overthink it</strong>. You&rsquo;re obviously not going to see everything tonight. You&rsquo;re only going to see a tiny fraction of what&rsquo;s on offer. And that&rsquo;s great! What&rsquo;s important is that you make the most of what you do attend. Applaud your readers. Compliment them after the readings. Talk to people about what they saw. Ask someone what they&rsquo;re reading. Have fun. Enjoy the night.</p>
