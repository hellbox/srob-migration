<p>The Nobel was granted to Alexievitch &ldquo;for her polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time.&rdquo; Remarkably, she is the very first journalist to ever win the Nobel in Literature. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34475251">The BBC explains</a>,</p>

<blockquote>Her best-known works in English translation include *Voices From Chernobyl*, an oral history of the 1986 nuclear catastrophe; and *Boys In Zinc*, a collection of first-hand accounts from the Soviet-Afghan war. The title refers to the zinc coffins in which the dead came home.</blockquote>

<p>Now is the time for some bores to start with the <em>why-not</em> caterwauls. &ldquo;Why not Philip Roth? Why not Joyce Carol Oates? Why not Haruki Murakami?&rdquo; These are short-sighted complaints by people who can&rsquo;t be bothered with contemporary literature unless it&rsquo;s been codified into some sort of modern &ldquo;canon.&rdquo; Nothing is more boring than canons, especially when the writer you&rsquo;re trying to canonize is Philip Roth.</p>

<p>If you <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/">look at recent history</a>, the Nobel committee has taken to celebrating talent that is not internationally famous, or at least not commonly celebrated in America and Great Britain. That, to me, is <strong>infinitely more exciting</strong> than handing the Nobel over to authors who already enjoy international acclaim.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know Alexievitch&rsquo;s work. I can&rsquo;t wait to read her.</p>
