As [Jennifer Schuessler reported in the *New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/arts/macarthur-foundation-announces-2016-genius-grant-winners.html?_r=0), the MacArthur Foundation announced their annual "Genius" grant winners yesterday. I'm very excited to see that the new list of "Geniuses" includes authors we've written about here at the *Seattle Review of Books* over the past year.

* Willie Fitzgerald [wrote a review incorporating **Claudia Rankine**'s compelling poetry collection *Citizen*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-publishers-dilemma/) last year.

* The brilliant **Maggie Nelson** has been written about a few times here on the site, most notably in [Cate McGehee's splendid review of *The Argonauts*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/body-of-work/) and Jennifer Bernstein's review of, among other books, [Nelson's *The Art of Cruelty*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/a-cruel-mistress/).

* I reviewed [the first issue of cartoonist Gene Luen Yang's comic book *New Super-Man*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/07/14/thursday-comics-hangover-the-super-man-of-shanghai/) when it was released two months ago.

Congratulations to all the "Geniuses," (Those quotation marks are accurate, according to the MacArthur style guide, but they always feel so sarcastic whenever I write about the MacArthur grants that I always consider leaving them out.) I look forward to publishing many more pieces about their works here on the *Seattle Review of Books* in years to come.
