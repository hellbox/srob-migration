<p>Yesterday, Book Expo America officially launched in Chicago. BEA is the biggest, loudest trade book show in the United States; it&rsquo;s when all the big publishers announce their biggest, splashiest projects and the industry looks ahead at the year to come. Publishing Perspectives just <a href="http://publishingperspectives.com/2016/05/as-bea-opens-a-new-global-ebook-report-on-a-mercurial-world-market/#.VzQZ598rIkg">ran an overview of a report</a> on the global state of e-books. And how are e-books doing? <strong>Not so great</strong>. In fact, the word &ldquo;stalled&rdquo; comes to mind. And the wide array of pricing — from $12.99 to $14.99 for many e-books at large online retailers to 99 cents for self-published titles —  could be confusing matters: &ldquo;the wider fear is that the advent of the paperless digital book and rock-bottom pricing has actually adjusted in the minds of reader-consumers the value of a book.&rdquo;</p>
