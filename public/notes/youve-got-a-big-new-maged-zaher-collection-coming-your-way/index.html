<p>In case you weren&rsquo;t keeping track, <a href="http://www.arundelbookstores.com/home.html">Arundel Books</a>, which used to be a beautiful bookstore on 1st Avenue downtown, is now a beautiful bookstore in the old Wessel &amp; Lieberman space facing Occidental Park in Pioneer Square. And Arundel founder Phil Bevis still publishes books, both under the <a href="http://www.arundelbookstores.com/publications.html">Arundel Press</a> shingle and, more expansively, as <a href="http://www.chatwinbooks.com/">Chatwin Books</a>. (One of Arundel Press&rsquo;s titles, Nicole Sarrocco&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.karatebride.com/KB2.html"><em>Karate Bride</em></a>, is a Seattle poetry classic.)</p>

<p>Bevis has just announced that Chatwin Books is publishing collected poetry editions (with previously published and new work) from three poets: <a href="http://www.themonarchreview.org/three-poems-maged-zaher/">Maged Zaher</a>, <a href="http://jackgrapes.com/grapes_bio.php">Jack Grapes</a>, and <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/rex-wilder">Rex Wilder</a>.</p>

<p>Zaher&rsquo;s will be the first in the series. Titled <em>Opting Out: Collected Poems (2000-2015)</em>, it will be out sometime this winter. Next will be <em>Last of the Outsiders: The Collected Poems of Jack Grapes Volume I</em>, out in late winter or spring 2016, with the second, still untitled, volume arriving later in the year. <em>The Collected Poems of Rex Wilder</em> will be published in spring of 2016. (Bevis thanks Red Hen Press for giving &ldquo;generous permission to use work from&rdquo; Wilder&rsquo;s <a href="http://redhen.org/authors/?author_UUID=A51AE7E1-F163-8D36-18A2-B1BC736822A3">two recent Red Hen releases</a>.)</p>

<p>Wilder and Grapes are both California poets. Zaher is a proud Seattleite (by way of Egypt), and a substantial collection of his work is a big deal for the Seattle literary scene, even moreso because he&rsquo;s being published by a Seattle press. Expect to hear a lot about this book in the next few months.</p>
