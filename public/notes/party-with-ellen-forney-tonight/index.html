<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1449864678945/CV1RnZlU8AALrFu.jpg" alt="" /></p>Awesome Seattle cartoonist Ellen Forney&rsquo;s giant portraits of hands have finally been installed at the Capitol Hill light rail station, which is (and I am pants-wettingly excited about this) set to open early next year. <strong>Tonight at 5 pm</strong>, Forney will be on hand at the station as part of the Capitol Hill Art Walk to sort-of christen the new artwork with <a href="http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/event/capitol-hill-light-rail-murals-sidewalk-party-art-opening/">hot beverages and a public party</a>. If you&rsquo;re a Forney fan — as everyone who&rsquo;s read <em>Marbles</em> or <em>I Love Led Zeppelin</em> undoubtedly is — you should show up for this one. (And you should also read my friend and former colleague <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/visual-art/features/2015/12/09/23247443/how-ellen-forney-got-the-right-pair-of-hands-for-her-capitol-hill-light-rail-station-mural">Jen Graves&rsquo;s interview</a> with Forney about the creation and installation of these pieces.)</p>
