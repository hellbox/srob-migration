<p>I&rsquo;m taking part in a pair of upcoming events that you should know about:</p>

<ul>
<li>This Saturday, February 3rd, I&rsquo;ll be on a panel at <a href="http://www.spl.org/calendar-of-events?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D126388054">Literary Career Day</a> at the downtown branch of the Seattle Public Library. This is a free event intended to offer information and encouragement to young people aged 16 - 24 who are interested in pursuing careers in the literary arts. It runs from 11 am to 4 pm, and <a href="https://onereel.org/literarycareerday">you can register here</a>. A description, from SPL&rsquo;s website:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>This event will start with Keynote Speakers, followed by lunch—free for all attendees—and a Table Fair featuring opportunities from local arts organizations. After lunch, attend the Breakout Session that's relevant to your interests. We'll finish off the afternoon with a Networking Party, featuring a live DJ, to help you get the most out of your Career Day!</blockquote>

<li>I&rsquo;m <a href="https://www.seattlesymphony.org/concerttickets/calendar/2017-2018/live-at-bh/benaroyahall/fran-lebowitz">interviewing Fran Lebowitz at Benaroya Hall on Sunday, February 18th</a>. Lebowitz possesses a remarkable wit — she&rsquo;s a natural heir to Dorothy Parker, Oscar Wilde, and other historical wiseasses. It&rsquo;s intimidating as hell to share a stage with her, and I&rsquo;ll certainly feel better if you&rsquo;re there to back me up. You should <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/seattle/she-is-not-amused/Content?oid=12813434">read this interview from the last time Lebowitz came to town</a> that was conducted by my friend Bethany Jean Clement to get an idea of what I&rsquo;m up against. This is terrifying for me, which means it should be fun, at the very least, to watch me squirm. Hell, I can guarantee that it will be entertaining to watch me get my clock cleaned by one of the funniest people alive.</li>
