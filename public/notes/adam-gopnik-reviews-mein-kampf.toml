Now that [*Mein Kampf* is back in the headlines](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/13/its-a-hitler/) — thanks a lot, Germany — Adam Gopnik [reviews the book for *The New Yorker*](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/does-mein-kampf-remain-a-dangerous-book). 

<blockquote>...the striking thing about the text as a text is that it is not so much diabolical or sinister as *creepy*. It is the last book in the world that you would expect a nascent Fascist dictator to write... Hitler, whom we suspect of being an embittered, envious, traumatized loser, presents himself as . . . an embittered, envious, traumatized loser.</blockquote>

This is a very good book review and you should [read the whole thing](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/does-mein-kampf-remain-a-dangerous-book).
