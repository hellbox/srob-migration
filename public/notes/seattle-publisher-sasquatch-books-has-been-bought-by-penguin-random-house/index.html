<p>This morning, Seattle publisher <a href="http://www.sasquatchbooks.com/">Sasquatch Books</a> announced that they&rsquo;ve been acquired by New York publisher Penguin Random House for &ldquo;an undisclosed sum.&rdquo; Sasquatch and Penguin Random House are not strangers to each other; the larger publisher has served as a distributor for Sasquatch since 2012, shipping the smaller publisher&rsquo;s titles to bookstores and marketing their upcoming books to retail buyers.</p>

<p>Sasquatch is not moving to New York; the press will maintain their offices and staff on 3rd Avenue downtown, and they will continue to publish titles — cookbooks, guidebooks, children&rsquo;s books, and so on — with a Northwest perspective.</p>

<p>“We are going to be the same Sasquatch Books as always, publishing great talent from the Pacific Northwest,&rdquo; Sasquatch publisher Gary Luke wrote me in an email yesterday. &ldquo;We are still an independent publishing company with our own editorial, design, production, and marketing. It’s important to point out that Sasquatch will not become an imprint of Penguin Random House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, to readers of the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>, I say: Got a book idea? We’d like to hear about it,” Luke concludes. (Sasquatch&rsquo;s submission guidelines are <a href="http://www.sasquatchbooks.com/about/">posted on their About page</a>.)</p>

<p>As for the immediate future, Sasquatch is publishing a full complement of local-interest books and/or books by local authors this fall. A pair of highlights: <a href="http://www.sasquatchbooks.com/book/?isbn=9781632171139&amp;pie--whiskey-by-kate-lebo"><em>Pie &amp; Whiskey</em></a> is an anthology collecting readings from a popular literary series, edited by Spokane authors Kate Lebo and Sam Ligon. And David M. Buerge&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.sasquatchbooks.com/book/?isbn=9781632171368&amp;chief-seattle-and-the-town-that-took-his-name-by-david-m-buerge"><em>Chief Seattle and the Town That Took His Name</em></a> is described as &ldquo;the first thorough historical account of Chief Seattle and his times.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll be reading more about both those books right here in the weeks to come.</p>
