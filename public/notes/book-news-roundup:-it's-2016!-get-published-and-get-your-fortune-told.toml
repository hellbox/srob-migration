Here's what's going on in the Seattle book world right now:

* Do you know a promising young writer? There's still time for them to apply to the [brand-new Jack Straw Young Writers program](http://www.jackstraw.org/programs/ed/youngwriters.shtml). Press materials say that "Selected writers will take part in one-on-one mentoring sessions with professional writers, a live performance coaching session, and a studio recording session with vocal coaching." Any high school student in Seattle is eligible; applications are due by Friday, January 22nd.

* Speaking of Jack Straw, have we raved about the writers that curator Karen Finneyfrock chose for the [2016 Jack Straw Writers Program](http://www.jackstraw.org/programs/writers/WritersForum/#wp16) yet? Soak this in: Anis Gisele, Ramon Isao, [EJ Koh](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/06/korean-war/), Robert Lashley, [Casandra Lopez](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/07/meet-the-short-run-vendors-casandra-lopez-of-asus/), Kirsten Sundberg Lunstrum, [Corinne Manning](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/authors/corinne-manning/), Ruby Hansen Murray, [Shin Yu Pai](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/20/an-interview-with-shin-yu-pai-redmonds-new-poet-laureate/), Alison Stagner, Shontina Vernon, and Carolyne Wright. These are going to be some kick-ass readings: the thought of Koh, Pai, and Lashley sharing a stage makes our knees go weak.

*  This is your midpoint reminder that the [Floating Bridge Press Chapbook Competition](http://www.floatingbridgepress.org/chapbook/subguidelines/) is still accepting entries through March 1st. The writer of the winning poetry chapbook will receive $500, their chapbook will be published, and they'll be the featured reader at a Floating Bridge event.

* The new issue of *Cirque: A Literary Journal for Alaska and the Pacific Northwest* is [available online](http://www.cirquejournal.com/index.php) and in print. It features a short story by Seattle author David Fewster, "The Poetry Slam," which is set in Seattle.

* This morning, [the Hugo House announced a fascinating new series](https://hugohouse.org/event/ask-the-oracle-at-hotel-sorrento/) that will be happening at the Sorrento: "Ask the Oracle" will feature writers using their own books as fortune-telling devices. Audience members will ask questions, and the writers will provide answers from the text of their books. They've got a great lineup for spring, including writers like [Stacey Levine](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/21/lit-crawl-itinerary-8-local-favorites/), [David Schmader](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/27/an-interview-with-david-schmader-the-brand-new-creative-director-at-the-bureau-of-fearless-ideas/), [Megan Kruse](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/tolstoys-unhappy-family-moves-to-the-northwest/), [Sarah Galvin](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/what-the-heart-wants/), [Anastacia Tolbert](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/25/rattail/), and [Kary Wayson](https://hugohouse.org/classy-talk-with-kary-wayson/). Sounds like a fun spin on the traditional reading. The first one is on February 8th.
