<p>There are three<br>
people float<br>
ing in a<br>
lake. One does<br>
not know how<br>
to swim and<br>
neither do<br>
the others<br>
saying I<br>
don’t know how<br>
to swim I<br>
don’t either.<br>
But there. They<br>
are. They’re float<br>
ing straight up<br>
and down so<br>
the top third<br>
of each face<br>
bobs just a<br>
bove the wa<br>
ter. These are<br>
a few of<br>
my favor<br>
ite subjects.</p>
