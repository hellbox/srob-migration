<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**My brother married a gazillionaire heiress. She's really, really nice. She's generous, takes the whole family on luxury vacations where she pays for everything once a year, is crazy about my brother and they are, like, sickeningly cute together. And, she's beautiful, and smart, and has a big degree and a real career on top of it all.**</p>

<p><strong>Anyway. I can&rsquo;t help it but feel like trash around her. I dropped out of high school and had drug issues, and did stuff I&rsquo;m not proud of. Now, I have my shit together like no other time in my life. I did it through writing, and sweating my pain and failure out of every pore in my body until my skin was clear. My life is really, really good now, and I&rsquo;m working on my first novel, and I&rsquo;ve been getting good feedback from my writer&rsquo;s group, and I have an agent that I&rsquo;m talking to.</strong></p>

<p><strong>But goddammit, my sister-in-law just sold a novel. She did it to this big house with a star-studded agent, and I just know it&rsquo;s going to sell a gazillion copies. I mean, she&rsquo;s Ivy League, so she&rsquo;s smart and deserves it, but I just can&rsquo;t help but feel like it&rsquo;s so unfair. I feel like trash next to her, and she could stop working and give away her money every day of her life and still have enough to buy a country, but I have to struggle for every scrap. I don&rsquo;t begrudge her, but I can&rsquo;t help but feel jealous and awful, and I want to be a good sister to her too.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Help me, Cienna! What should I do?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Sister Heart, Capitol Hill**</p>
 

<p class="noindent">Dear Sister Heart,</p>
 

<p class="noindent">Succumbing to jealousy is graceless and exhausting, like signing on to be the principal dancer in a clubfoot ballet.</p>
 

<p>I have been seethingly, sweatily jealous of two women as an adult: a fellow writer who I felt unfavorably compared to and the girlfriend of a man I briefly loved, who unfortunately shares many of my passions and hobbies (with the exception of breastfeeding spiders). Unlike you, there were no warring feelings of love for either woman. I felt only ugly things. At one point, I fantasized about the vainer one contracting jaw cancer and having her lower jaw removed so perhaps &mdash; just perhaps &mdash; she would post fewer pictures of herself doing things I loved to do (with the exception of breastfeeding spiders) with people I loved on the internet.</p>

<p>I wish I could say I overcame those feelings but I didn’t, not really. Fortunately, they burned so hot that they mostly burned themselves out. Once my all-consuming jealousy had collapsed into an emotional bruise that only ached when I acknowledged it, I was able to privately concede that neither woman deserved the emotions I ascribed to them. They had unwittingly threatened parts of my identity that I cherished, at times in my life when I felt especially vulnerable.</p>

<p>You, Sister Heart, are in an enviable position: You’re at a very good place in your life, you respect the woman you envy, and it sounds like you have a good relationship with her. You should know that her successes don’t undercut your own &mdash; the insights of a billionaire heiress writer are likely radically different from the insights of an ex-drug-using writer (and frankly, your life sounds more fascinating). There’s room in the publishing world for you both.</p>

<p>Looking back, if I were in your position and had a relationship with either woman, I would have exorcised my demons by telling them how I felt, in my own clubfooted way. Like, “I mostly enjoy your writing but I hate that people compare us because we’re both women.” Or: “I will probably always resent that a person who was so important to me treats you better than he ever could me. Sorry about that. Also, would it physically kill you to take a picture that didn’t prominently feature yourself in it?”</p>

<p>Sometimes I still fondly remember the jaw cancer.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>

<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
