<p>I enjoyed the first issue of sci-fi writer Saladin Ahmed&rsquo;s <em>Black Bolt</em> series for Marvel Comics, but I ultimately didn&rsquo;t continue with the book, because Black Bolt is the very definition of a one-note character. The best writing in the world couldn&rsquo;t make an aloof mute king with a tuning fork on his forehead a compelling protagonist. But there was so much talent in evidence in that first issue of <em>Black Bolt</em> that when I saw Ahmed had a new creator-owned series coming out from Boom! Studios, I was eager to give it a try.</p>

<p><em>Abbott</em>, published for the first time yesterday, is a new series about an African-American newspaper reporter in 1972 Detroit. Elena Abbott is described in the first issue of <em>Abbott</em> as a &ldquo;black Lois Lane,&rdquo; but Ahmed admits in interviews that he envisions the character as more along the lines of the cult TV show <em>Kolchak the Night Stalker</em>.</p>

<p>A tough Black journalist on the mean streets of 70s Detroit, fighting supernatural menaces? Yes, please! <em>Abbott</em> has all the makings of a great comic series, and artist Sami Kivelä is a revelation: he draws apartments that look lived in, and figures that have lived entire lives. It&rsquo;s a flat-out gorgeous book.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame, then, that the first issue of <em>Abbott</em> suffers from a pretty severe cass of first-issue-itis. There are a lot of word balloons here covering up Kivelä&rsquo;s beautiful artwork, and a lot of them could have been trimmed. The exposition flows hot and heavy, with a lot of telling and not enough showing. Early in the issue, Abbott shows up at a crime scene with her own camera. She&rsquo;s greeted by an older white photographer. This is their exchange:</p>

<blockquote><p>—Holy crap, Abbott, Fred's got you taking your own pictures now? That's ridiculous. He giving you any kind of budget?</p>

<p>—Hello, Murray. It's not Fred. It's the higher-ups. Someone didn't care for my police brutality stories. I'm being punished.</p>

<p>—That's too bad. You're a good reporter, Abbott. A damn good reporter. Better than the little @#$%& I'm working with now.</p>

<p>—Thank you, Murray. And you're the best crime photographer in Detroit.</p>

<p>—Now you're just flattering me.</p>

<p>—Well, it is possible I'm hoping you'll tell me what the police know here, since no one else will.</p></blockquote>

<p>This exchange desperately needs an editor.  There&rsquo;s way too much backstory and repetition and cross-talk for the first few pages of a comic. I&rsquo;d love to see Murray and Abbott&rsquo;s history relayed through an intimate exchange that didn&rsquo;t lay everything out so plainly.</p>

<p>As the issue carries on, <em>Abbott</em> starts to pick up in pace, building to a cliffhanger that really sets the premise in motion. I&rsquo;m definitely coming back for the second issue. But I&rsquo;m also willing to bet that the second issue of <em>Abbott</em> should have been the first issue; dropping the reader in the middle of the action and forcing them to figure out the story as it goes along is always preferable to explaining everything.</p>
