<blockquote>A Denver-area store called Isis Books & Gifts wants the world to know its name comes from the Egyptian goddess of healing and motherhood and it isn't run by terrorists.</blockquote>

Isis Books & Gifts has been vandalized five times in the last year, presumably because of, as Isis owner John Harrison told the Associated Press, "some ignorant people believing that somehow the terrorists have a store, a gift store, in the middle of Denver, Colorado."

The [amount of stupid in America this week](https://twitter.com/isisAnchalee/status/666718100377628673) is truly staggering. This story came to me [via the *Idaho Statesman*](http://www.idahostatesman.com/living/religion/article45323835.html), which — gasp! — has "*IS*" in its name. Everybody riot!
