<p>For over a year now we&rsquo;ve been publishing poems by local writers every Tuesday (you can see them all on the <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/tuesday-poem/">archive page</a>). Each poet recommends the next in a chain that has led us through some of the most fascinating corners of the Northwest poetry scene.</p>

<p>We wanted to take one week out of our schedule to look back, in appreciation to the poets who have shared their work with us, and in hopes that you might discover a piece or two that speaks to you that you may have missed the first time.</p>

<p>Next week, we&rsquo;ll be back with the start of our Fall chain, but in the meantime, here&rsquo;s a retrospective.</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p>Our first poet was <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/04/argument-waltz-with-pessimistic-drowning/">Kelli Russel Agodon</a> (she also wrote for us about <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/06/21/a-poet-explores-when-poems-go-viral/">poetry</a> going <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/06/21/interviewing-maggie-smith-and-the-editors-of-waxwing-magazine-about-the-poem-good-bones-going-viral/">viral</a>). After her: <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/18/waking-up-strange/">Kathleen Flenniken</a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/25/rattail/">Anastacia Renee Tolbert</a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/15/we-walk-a-heart-around-lake-union/">Michelle Peñaloza</a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/22/ten-thousand-saw-i-at-a-glance/">Arlene Kim</a>, and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/29/manegg/">Don Mee Choi</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/06/korean-war/">EJ Koh</a> was next &mdash; we&rsquo;re presenting her, Robert Lashley, and Sherman Alexie at the Elliott Bay Book Company on November 11th, so please save the date. Then: <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/20/variation-on-a-theme/">Claudia Castro Luna</a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/27/at-dungeness-spit/">Jourdan Imani Keith</a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/03/why-a-cuban-living-in-the-nw-isnt-going-to-write-about-rain-or-salmon/">Felicia Gonzalez</a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/10/all-of-us-whatever-we-are/">Emily Bedard</a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/17/time-capsule/">Erin Malone</a>, and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/24/dispatched/">Christine Deavel</a>.</p>

<p>We spent the month of December <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/01/this-month-we-celebrate-the-life-of-madeline-defrees/">celebrating the life of Madeline DeFrees</a> by running five of her poems: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/01/matinal/">Matinal</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/08/phobias-incorporated/">Phobias Incorporated</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/15/grandmother-grant/">Grandmother Grant</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/22/in-the-locker-room/">In the locker room</a>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;<a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/29/going-back-to-the-convent/">Going Back to the Convent</a>&rdquo;.</p>

We did a brave thing, then, breaking our tradition of publishing only women with three short poems by <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/19/three-poems/">Maged Zaher</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/26/inkwells/">Deborah Woodard</a> rebalanced our gender ratio, followed by <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/02/in-response-to-cd-wrights-questionnaire-in-january/">Samar Abulhassan</a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/09/excerpt-from-lyrebird/">Meredith Clark</a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/16/panic-blossom/">Melanie Noel</a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/23/star-lab/">Jessie Knoles</a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/01/its-what-tells-you-youre-in-trouble/">Ashley E Booth</a>, and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/08/triangulation/">Sierra Golden</a>.</p>

<p>We were thrilled to run a lovely piece by an unknown local writer we think has a great future: <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/15/hunger-rites/">Sherman Alexie</a>, followed by <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/29/apology-in-the-age-of-construction/">Jane Wong</a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/05/love-letter/">Quenton Baker</a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/12/triumph/">Alex Gallo-Brown</a>, and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/19/the-quick/">Bill Carty</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/26/the-familiar/">Kristen Steenbeeke</a> ended April for us, and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/05/03/formulas-for-successful-curation/">Rebecca Hoogs</a> led us into May, along with <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/05/17/selfies-in-the-wilderness/">Rachel Kessler</a> (who also did a bang-up job <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/31/notes-from-the-field-day-1-of-awp/">covering</a> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/01/notes-from-the-field-awp-15/">all</a> of <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/02/notes-from-the-field-awp-day-2/">AWP</a> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/03/notes-from-the-field-awp-day-3/">Los Angeles</a> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/04/notes-from-the-field-awp-wrap-up-the-day-after/">for us</a>).</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s a lot. In these works you&rsquo;ll find humor, beauty, playfulness, anger, sarcasm, frustration, desire, love, bravery, and exhilaration. We couldn&rsquo;t be happier about our Tuesday Poem series, and are so pleased to be able to offer it to you.</p>

<p>Please do spend today browsing them, and we&rsquo;ll see you next Tuesday with new poets and new work.</p>
