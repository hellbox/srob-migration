<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_The Calligraphy of Alice_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1307403978/the-calligraphy-of-alice?ref=home_potd). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[The Kelly-Winterton Press](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1307403978/the-calligraphy-of-alice/creator_bio).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>A first-ever compilation devoted to Aliceâ€™s calligraphy and drawing</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Calligraphy is the most amazing thing. Nobody knows letterforms with the acuity and brilliance of a master calligrapher, and there is not a master calligrapher alive better than Alice Koeth. Her work is simply breathtaking. Think about how many times you've seen work like hers &mdash; or, if you're in New York, maybe hers &mdash; and wondered who made it. Well, come meet Alice.
</p>

<p>Alice also has spent her life sharing technique, teaching her craft, and making sure others knew how to wield the mighty pen as well as she could.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
Alice has a classic hand. Her work has a distinct 20th century feel to it &mdash; which is not to say dated. It is to say that the craftspeople who made the graphic arts in that era had hand skills that very few designers or lettering artists today could match. They came from years of daily work, of constantly studying letters and composition in a way that computers, with their perfect lines and instant imagery, can't match. 

</p>

<p>We are not Luddites here at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>, but you don&rsquo;t need to be one to mark the differences that working inside a computer, where nothing is ever permanent, and taking wet ink to a piece of expensive paper to make a complicated design that you could ruin with a bad mark. Confidence, craft, and care make master calligraphers. What an amazing joy to witness a collection of Alice&rsquo;s work in this format.</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    They're 171% funded with 13 days to go. They don't need you in the slightest. But, if you're drooling looking at the photos, you should definitely throw your money down for a copy of this awesome work.
