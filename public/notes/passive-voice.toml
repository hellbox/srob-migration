I use a trick to teach students<br>
how to avoid passive voice.

Circle the verbs.<br>
Imagine inserting “by zombies”<br>
after each one.

Have the words been claimed<br>
by the flesh-hungry undead?<br>
If so, passive voice.

I wonder if these<br>
sixth graders will recollect,<br>
on summer vacation,<br>
as they stretch their legs<br>
on the way home<br>
from Yellowstone or Yosemite<br>
and the byway’s historical marker<br>
beckons them to the<br>
site of an Indian village &mdash;

Where _trouble was brewing_.<br>
Where, _after further hostilities, the army was directed to enter_.<br>
Where _the village was razed after the skirmish occurred_.<br>
Where _most were women and children_.

Riveted bramble of passive verbs<br>
etched in wood &mdash;<br>
stripped hands<br>
breaking up from the dry ground<br>
to pinch the meat<br>
of their young red tongues.
