<li><p>In a great piece, <a href="http://crosscut.com/2017/09/hugo-house-washington-state-legislature-capital-budget-olympia/">John Stang at Crosscut </a> writes about the way the state legislature is fucking over Hugo House&rsquo;s move home:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Hugo House has raised about $4.8 million for construction, but it still needs slightly more than $1 million to start the work. That happens to be the amount the Legislature was supposed to appropriate before the state capital budget stalled... Consequently, a move-back date in early 2018 has been delayed indefinitely, and plans to expand classes and accommodate more students are in limbo as well.</blockquote>

<li><p>We&rsquo;re big fans of <a href="https://shoutyourabortion.com/">Shout Your Abortion</a> around here, and we love it when they publish stuff. (I reviewed <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-visible-women/">their first zine</a> last summer.) So we&rsquo;re thrilled that SYA founder <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marisxmaris">Amelia Bonow used the second anniversary of her organization to announce</a> that they&rsquo;re going to be publishing a book, which she described as &ldquo;a big beautiful collection of the art, artifacts, and stories which have shaped this movement over the last two years, as well as brand new work commissioned especially for this project.&rdquo; If you have anything you&rsquo;d like to say about abortion, submissions for the book open up on October 3rd. Details about the submission guidelines will be in Shout Your Abortion&rsquo;s newsletter. You say you don&rsquo;t subscribe to Shout Your Abortion&rsquo;s newsletter?

<li><p>Peter Kuper has always been a forward-thinking cartoonist, but this is a jaw-dropping discovery from Steve Lieber:</p></li>

<li>If you were anywhere near a bookstore or library in 2011, you probably know that the big literary sensation of that year was Chad Harbach&rsquo;s novel <em>The Art of Fielding</em>. <a href="https://www.theawl.com/2017/09/lets-talk-about-the-art-of-fielding-lawsuit/">Sylvia Killingsworth at The Awl wrote a post</a> about a lawsuit circling around <em>Fielding</em>, and it&rsquo;s well worth your time.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>If you remember the year 2011 when The Big Book of the Year was The Art of Fielding and you don’t want to die after reading that clause, take a moment to read over the allegations of one Charles Green against the one Chad Harbach in the matter of wrongfully appropriating elements of the former’s manuscript, Bucky’s 9th, and interpolating them into the latter’s long-languishing first novel (which then sold for $665,000 and debuted to All The Acclaim)</blockquote>
