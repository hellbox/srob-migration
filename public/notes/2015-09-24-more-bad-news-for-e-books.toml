After noting [the news yesterday](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/23/ebook-sales-slip-independent-bookstores-increase/) that e-book sales have dipped ten percent in the first five months of this year, I stumbled across [this post on Good E-Reader](http://goodereader.com/blog/e-book-news/people-are-not-reading-the-e-books-they-buy-anymore), which indicates that e-books might be doing even worse than the numbers are letting on:

<blockquote>At Book Expo America last April, [e-book retailer] Kobo dived deep into global reading behavior and analyzed the data.  They found that **60% of e-books that are purchased from their complete line of apps, e-readers, tablets and via the web are never opened**. Interestingly, the more expensive the book was, the more likely the reader would at least start it.</blockquote>

Another tech firm found that "40 to 45% of e-books never get opened." Those numbers can't be sustainable; is there any other mass-market product (besides maybe condoms) where around half of all purchased items are never used?
