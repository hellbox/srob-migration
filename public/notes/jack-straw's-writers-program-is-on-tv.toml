KING 5's *New Day NW* interviewed local writers Anca Szilagyi and Erin Malone about the very worthy [Jack Straw Writers Program](http://www.jackstraw.org/programs/writers/WritersForum/). (I'd embed the video here, but in my experience KING 5's video viewer tends to make websites shiver, roll over, and die. You're better off just [clicking through and viewing it on their own site](http://www.king5.com/story/entertainment/television/programs/new-day-northwest/2015/08/05/jack-straw-writers-program-fellowships/31157987/).) The interview also discusses Hugo House, and it promotes a Jack Straw reading that happens tonight at [Elliott Bay Book Company](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/jack-straw-writers-group-reading-emily-bedard-laura-da%E2%80%99-erin-malone-matthew-schnirman).

I'll admit to being happily flabbergasted; I can't recall the last time a local TV news show has focused on a writing program. **Fine work, KING 5!** More like this please.
