<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday, October 30: *Leonardo Da Vinci* Reading**</h5></p>
Walter Isaacson has made a career out of writing about geniuses. He’s written books about Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Benjamin Franklin. His latest book is a biography of one of history’s most important geniuses: Leonardo Da Vinci. How does one man paint several of the most recognizable paintings of all time, make world-changing discoveries in anatomy and biology, and craft a flying machine in just one lifetime?

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday, October 31: Booktoberfest: Halloween Horror Hour**</h5></p>
Seattle’s librarians are fucking awesome. They sing karaoke. They kick your ass at trivia. They recommend books and help you locate some obscure title you saw one time five years ago in Bora Bora and the only thing you know for sure is that the dust jacket was blue. And they also read you scary stories on Halloween when they could surely be at a party somewhere canoodling with someone dressed up as Sexy Regret. Go get scared by a library professional. They went to school for this.
*Third Place Books Seward Park, 5041 Wilson Ave S, 474-2200, http://thirdplacebooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 pm.*


<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday, November 1st:  Reading Through It Book Club **</h5></p>
The joint book club from the *Seattle Review of Books* and the *Seattle Weekly* continues with this month’s selection, *White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide* by Carol Anderson. The book was originally published as an editorial in 2014, so this is not some hastily slapped-together post-Trump book (looking at you, [Noam Chomsky]( http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-good-old-days-arent-what-they-used-to-be/)). Even if you didn’t buy your copy of the book at Third Place Books, you’re welcome to come for what should be a really enlightening discussion. Plus, you can bring drinks from the bar into the book club!

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday, November 2nd:  *The Obama Inheritance* Reading**</h5></p>
*The Obama Inheritance* is a new anthology of 15 stories which promises to transform noir into an “over-the-top, transcendental psychedelic thriller ride of pulpy goodness.” Every story in the book treats a far-right Republican conspiracy theory about Barack Obama as though it is true. Seattle sci-fi genius (and *Seattle Review of Books* columnist) Nisi Shawl will read from her contribution to the book. *Third Place Books Ravenna, 6504 20th Ave NE, 525-2347 http://thirdplacebooks.com, 7 pm, free. *
