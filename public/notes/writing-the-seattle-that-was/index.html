<p>Seattle writer and editor Jaimee Garbacik has <a href="http://www.seattleghosts.com/2015/08/01/call-for-submissions/">put out a call for writers and artists</a> to contribute to The Ghosts of Seattle Past, an &ldquo;interactive art installation&rdquo; about remembering the disappearing landmarks of Seattle:</p>

<blockquote>Share your memories of our lost spaces, whether from last week or the last century. Send your photographs, drawings, and memorabilia. Write just a few lines or submit a long-form essay celebrating a place you held dear. Use the medium that tells your story best.</blockquote>

<p>Submissions will close on August 31st. The exhibit will debut at the <a href="http://www.shortrun.org/">Short Run Small Press Festival</a>, which happens this year on October 31 at Seattle Center. (<strong>Full disclosure</strong>: I&rsquo;m contributing an essay to this project, but I&rsquo;m not getting paid for it. I just think it&rsquo;s a neat idea and I like to support neat ideas.)</p>
