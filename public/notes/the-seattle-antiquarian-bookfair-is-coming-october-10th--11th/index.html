<p>Our thanks, again, to our current event sponsor The Seattle Antiquarian Bookfair. If you love books, especially rare, not to mention ephemera, and collectables, you’ll really enjoy the fair. There’s a great video on our sponsor page that shows a view at last years event. Don’t miss it — and be sure to thanks them for sponsoring <em>The Seattle Review of Books</em>.</p>

<p>We love our partners. They allow us to bring you the the reviews, poetry, and notes every day of the week. We don’t do advertising like other websites. Our sponsors work with us directly to bring you a good experience. It’s all part of our goal to make <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">online advertising something that benefits readers and publishers</a>. Take a look at what we’re offering, you might just find something you love.</p>
