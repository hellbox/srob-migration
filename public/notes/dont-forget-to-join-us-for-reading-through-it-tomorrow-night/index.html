<p>Tomorrow night at Third Place Books Seward Park at 7 pm, I hope you&rsquo;ll join <em>Seattle Weekly</em> editor-in-chief Mark Baumgarten and myself and my <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> cofounder Martin McClellan in a discussion of Jonathan Haidt&rsquo;s amazing book <em>The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion</em>.</p>

<p>The May installment of our Reading Through It book club is more theoretical and less interested in current events. It&rsquo;s more than just a way to understand the conservative perspective — it&rsquo;s about the many ways that we all seek to organize the world to suit our individual worldview. This could be the most important book we&rsquo;ve discussed yet, and it&rsquo;s sure to be a fantastic conversation. I hope you&rsquo;ll join us.</p>
