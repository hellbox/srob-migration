<p>We love a good book review here at <em>SRoB</em>, and &ldquo;<a href="http://the-tusk.com/2015/09/29/donald-trump-reviews-the-lord-of-the-rings/">Donald Trump Reviews <em>The Lord of the Rings</em></a>,&rdquo; over at the Tusk, is a wonderful book review. This is what we mean when we keep grabbing people by the shoulders and shaking them violently and shouting &ldquo;BOOK REVIEWS ARE LITERATURE!&rdquo; This piece employs satire to comment on a book while also addressing current events. <a href="http://the-tusk.com/2015/09/29/donald-trump-reviews-the-lord-of-the-rings/">Go read it</a>. (Also, sorry about the grabbing-you-by-the-shoulders-and-shouting thing. We just get a little overexcited every now and then, is all.)</p>
