<p>Yesterday, <em>Slate</em> published <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2015/10/herman_melville_s_bartleby_the_scrivener_an_interactive_annotated_text.html?wpsrc=sh_all_dt_tw_top">this amazing interactive annotated edition of <em>Bartleby, the Scrivener</em></a>. I&rsquo;m not a fan of all of Melville&rsquo;s writing, but <em>Bartleby</em> becomes more relevant with each passing year. It&rsquo;s a powerful American myth, and when viewed from another angle it can be read as kind of a forerunner to <em>Office Space</em> and <em>The Office</em> and other comedies about the drudgery of middle management.</p>
