Wow! Anyone who follows [*Between the World and Me* author Ta-Nehisi Coates](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-seattle-of-your-nightmares/) knows that he's an ardent comics fan, but I certainly didn't see this coming. *The New York Times* says:

<blockquote>...it seems only natural that Marvel has asked Mr. Coates to take on a new Black Panther series set to begin next spring. Writing for that comics publisher is a childhood dream that, despite the seeming incongruity, came about thanks to his day job. “*The Atlantic* is a pretty diverse place in terms of interest, but there are no comics nerds,” besides himself, Mr. Coates said in an interview.

His passions intersected in May, during the magazine’s New York Ideas seminar, he interviewed Sana Amanat, a Marvel editor, about diversity and inclusion in comic books. Ms. Amanat led the creation of the new Ms. Marvel, a teenage Muslim girl living in Jersey City, based on some of her own childhood experiences.

“It was a fruitful discussion,” he recalled.</blockquote>

*Black Panther* will be illustrated by Brian Stelfreeze. And of course there will be a movie of the character released in 2018, so it's quite possible Coates's story might wind up being adapted to film. I can't wait for this comic to start.
