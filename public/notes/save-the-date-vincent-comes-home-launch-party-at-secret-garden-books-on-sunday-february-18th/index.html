<p>Here&rsquo;s a <em>SRoB</em> conflict of interest that might be of interest to you: <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> columnist <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/aaron-bagley/">Aaron Bagley</a> is debuting a new kid&rsquo;s book he created with his wife Jessixa Bagley in two weeks at the wondrous Secret Garden Bookshop in Ballard, and you&rsquo;re invited!</p>

<p><em>Vincent Comes Home</em> is the story of a cat who lives on a freighter. When the freighter comes to port and its sailors all return to their homes, Vincent wonders if he has a home of his own. Aaron and Jessixa created the watercolor art for the book together and it&rsquo;s gorgeous.</p>

<p>The party is on <a href="http://www.secretgardenbooks.com/event/jessixa-bagley-aaron-bagley-vincent-comes-home">Sunday, February 18th at 4 pm</a>. Jessixa and Aaron will be there. And it&rsquo;s free!</p>
