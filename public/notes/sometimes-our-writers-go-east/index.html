<p>Over at <a href="http://www.inlander.com/spokane/a-song-of-my-selves/Content?oid=2736910"><em>The Inlander</em></a>, I wrote a piece about Seattle memoirist Elissa Washuta, who&rsquo;ll be reading at Get Lit!, Spokane&rsquo;s wonderful annual book festival. We talked about the distinction of being a memoirist versus being an essayist, whether people got mad at Washuta for the way they were presented in her memoir, and what the most surprising thing about publishing a memoir. I love introducing Seattle&rsquo;s authors to new audiences; I hope you&rsquo;ll <a href="http://www.inlander.com/spokane/a-song-of-my-selves/Content?oid=2736910">go take a look at the piece</a>.</p>
