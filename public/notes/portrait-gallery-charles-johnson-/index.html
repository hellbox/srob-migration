<br />**Word Works: Charles Johnson**<br />
Tonight Hugo House is welcoming Johnson to give a talk about the craft of writing as part of their Word Works series. He’ll be delivering a lecture based on his essay “Storytelling and the Alpha Narrative,” and then he’ll take audience questions on just about any writing-related topics they can imagine. It’s an opportunity to listen to one of our most consequential authors, and to drink in a tiny sip of his oceans of expertise.<br />
*Annex Theatre. 1100 E Pike St, http://hugohouse.org, 7 pm, $15*
