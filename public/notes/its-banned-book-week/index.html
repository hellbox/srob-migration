<p>Galleycat has assembled excerpts of the <a href="http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/free-samples-of-the-most-banned-books-of-2015/110431">ten most frequently challenged library books of 2015</a>. Seattle&rsquo;s own Sherman Alexie and Ellen Forney are right up at the top of the list with <em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em>. Go give these books a try, and if you&rsquo;re interested in reading further, please acquire copies of the books from your local library or independent bookstore. Banned Book Week isn&rsquo;t just about celebrating the authors who push the boundaries of what&rsquo;s acceptable; it&rsquo;s also about celebrating the heroes who make those books available for everyone.</p>
