<li><p>The awesome organizers of comics and art show Short Run made a special announcement about their upcoming fall show: <a href="http://shortrun.org/first-round-of-special-guests/">Special guests at the show this year</a> will include Vanessa Davis and Trevor Alixopulos. Davis&rsquo;s comic <em>Make Me a Woman</em> was published by Drawn &amp; Quarterly, and Alixopulos is an up-and-comer who will be in the newest volume of the <em>Kramer&rsquo;s Ergot</em> anthology. In case you&rsquo;ve missed it, Short Run also revealed the identity of <a href="http://shortrun.org/brendan-kiefer-announced-dash-winner-2016/">this year&rsquo;s Dash grant recipient</a>, a program that provides funds to an artist to make a new comic in time for the show; this year&rsquo;s Dash winner is a new-to-Seattle cartoonist named Brendan Kiefer. The Short Run Festival will happen at Fisher Pavilion in Seattle Center this year on <strong>Saturday, November 6th</strong>. Save the date.</p></li>

<li><p>Now is the time to nominate the Seattle-area &ldquo;artists, arts and cultural organizations and community members&rdquo; that you love for the <a href="http://officeofartsculture.cmail19.com/t/ViewEmail/y/4E068F7E24680F6D">2016 Mayor&rsquo;s Arts Awards</a>. Get your nominations in by May 31st.</p></li>

<li><p>It&rsquo;s always award season somewhere: Lots of women <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/05/16/478269681/people-want-these-stories-women-win-big-at-the-nebula-awards">won at the Nebula Awards</a> last week, and a pair of Japanese literary prizewinners <a href="http://www.complete-review.com/saloon/archive/201605b.htm#vu3">have been announced</a>, including an 80-year-old literary critic who won a prize for up-and-coming authors. Also, yesterday <a href="http://lithub.com/announcing-the-2016-o-henry-prize-stories/">the O Henry Prizewinning short stories were announced</a>. Congratulations to everyone.</p></li>

<li><p>Marley Dias, the 11-year-old who invented the <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/27/book-news-roundup-the-diversity-in-publishing-edition/">#1000BlackGirlBooks</a> movement, guest-starred on <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/anotherround/16-books-we-loved-as-young-black-girls?utm_term=.rqoMv9Gvv#.oc65aQLaa">this week&rsquo;s episode of the BuzzFeed podcast <em>Another Round</em></a>, which included a roundtable on beloved children&rsquo;s books. If you are in need of something heartwarming after another dismal week of Trumpery, this is the most life-affirming thing I&rsquo;ve heard in a very long time.</p></li>

<li><p>Jeff Bezos <a href="http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2756#m32553">has confirmed</a> that more Amazon Books brick-and-mortar stores are on the way. If you haven&rsquo;t read it, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/09/the-algorithm-method/">here&rsquo;s my experience</a> at the first Amazon Books store.</p></li>

<li><p>Yes, and <a href="http://electricliterature.com/jonathan-franzen-competes-on-jeopardy-knows-about-birds-but-not-shakespeare/">Jonathan Franzen went on <em>Jeopardy!</em> this week</a> and he didn&rsquo;t win and he didn&rsquo;t embarrass himself. It&rsquo;s pretty sketchy that one of the categories on his show was &ldquo;Birds,&rdquo; given that  Franzen is maybe the most famous birder in the United States right now and he was representing a bird-preservation nonprofit on the show. Sure, it was all for charity, but it&rsquo;s still a hell of a coincidence, isn&rsquo;t it?</p></li>

<li><p>In Austrailia, a civil servant published a book and was arrested for it, but <a href="http://www.mhpbooks.com/civil-servant-arrested-for-publishing-book-of-already-public-information/">according to Melville House&rsquo;s MobyLives blog</a>, &ldquo;nobody seems quite sure why&rdquo; he was arrested. Fascinating.</p></li>

<li><p>There is no good goddamned reason to publish <a href="http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/random-house-childrens-books-to-publish-a-young-adult-version-of-the-da-vinci-code/120424">a young adult version of the <em>Da Vinci Code</em></a>. If a teenager wants to read the <em>Da Vinci Code</em>, they should just read the <em>Da Vinci Code</em>. It&rsquo;s not a particularly challenging book on any level, from reading comprehension to content. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with reading a trashy thriller, but the unnecessary repackaging of trashy thrillers to appeal to different demographics is getting tiresome.</p></li>
