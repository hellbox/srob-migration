<p>After a terrible holiday season, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/12/barnes-noble-cuts-staff-after-dismal-holiday-season.html">Lauren Thomas and Lauren Hirsch report for CNBC</a>, Barnes &amp; Noble without warning laid off an unspecified number of employees on Monday morning.</p>

<blockquote>Barnes & Noble is trimming its staff, laying off lead cashiers, digital leads and other experienced workers in a company-wide clearing, CNBC has learned from sources familiar with the matter...The number of affected workers couldn't immediately be determined. As of April 29 of last year, Barnes & Noble employed about 26,000 people.</blockquote>

<p>The smart thing for Barnes &amp; Noble to do would be to give its employees more control over its stock, to make each store a unique neighborhood hub with plenty of local character, and to create welcoming spaces staffed by well-read employees. Of course, the company will likely do the exact opposite: more corporate control over stores, cost-cutting measures that make the stores feel even more empty, and fewer staff around to make personalized recommendations and to create local flavor.</p>

<p>I worked at Borders as it started its slow, sad corporate decline — <a href="https://medium.com/@paulconstant/books-without-borders-b8ccb08b5b8a">you can read my account of that here</a> — and from the outside, this Barnes &amp; Noble news looks very familiar to me. There&rsquo;s always some possibility that Barnes &amp; Noble might be saved, but I wouldn&rsquo;t bet money on it.</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s time for the publishing industry to start figuring out how to thrive without a Barnes &amp; Noble in every corner of the nation</strong>. Right now, losing B&amp;N would be disastrous for publishing and for American literature in general; it would move all the power to Amazon, and it would close the only bookstore in many rural communities around the country. If I were one of the big publishers, I would start organizing with independent bookstores — <em>right now</em> — to figure out a way forward together.</p>
