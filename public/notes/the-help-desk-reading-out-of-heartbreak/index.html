<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>I just got dumped. I need some inspiration — what’s the greatest love story you’ve ever read? One friend gave me a book of Leonard Cohen poems and I almost killed myself.</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>Heath, Wallingford</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Heath,</p>

<p class="noindent">I'm honored that you are turning to me for advice – and your timing is impeccable. Over Christmas I was sharply criticized for gifting my teenage sister a copy of the mortician's bible, *Corpse Makeup for Beginners*, because I thought her face could use some humanizing. This has caused many to question whether I am indeed an empathetic human being qualified to dole out free advice, or whether I am simply a lipsticked Chupacabra who enjoys fucking with strangers and attends family gatherings for the free taquitos.</p>

<p>I am eager to redeem myself.</p>

<p>First off: Why are you torturing yourself with love stories? Your heart and liver are allowed to wallow at a time like this; it is your brain&rsquo;s job to try and distract your other squishy human organs – all of which I can name because I am definitely human – from grieving too hard.</p>

<p>Here is what you need to read: Flannery O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s <em>Good Country People</em>, followed by Voltaire&rsquo;s <em>Candide</em>. <em>Good Country People</em> illustrates how flawed our judgment can be when it comes to evaluating other people and their motivations, and <em>Candide</em> is a good antidote to all your friends who will tell you, post breakup, bullshit like &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a perfect someone out there waiting for you&rdquo; and &ldquo;everything happens for a reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry you were dumped. Whenever I have been dumped by my human boyfriends, or when my mailman asks to be reassigned because he finds my weekly orders of goat&rsquo;s blood and human magazines to be excessive, I remind myself that I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be around anyone who doesn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m tops, and I move on. I encourage you to do the same.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,<br>
Cienna</p>
