Sponsor Steve Toutonghi's debut Science Fiction Novel _Join_ was just released, and you owe it to yourself to check out the <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">first chapter on our sponsorship page</a>. 

_Join_ is a mind-expanding story set in a world where multiple people can join into a single consciousness. The tale is rich, tense, and nuanced, and full of the mind-expanding ideas only possible in a good science fiction story. We're so grateful to Steve for his sponsorship, and urge you to take a look. The worst thing that can happen is that you discover a new book you want to read. Not such a bad deal, eh?

We have only <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">four sponsor slots left</a>, before August. If you're a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, [take a look at our open dates](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/). We'd love to talk to you about opportunities to sponsor us. It's our way of making internet advertising something to look forward to.
