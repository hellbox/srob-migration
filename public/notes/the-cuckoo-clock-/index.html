<p>When I was a girl<br>
I wanted to live<br>
inside of one.</p>

<p>A wooden, small<br>
place to hold me.<br>
I was in love</p>

<p>with its bird<br>
face. I imagined us<br>
married. The dream</p>

<p>of domesticity. Keeping<br>
house à la bric-a-brac<br>
or conversation piece.</p>

<p>But time has told<br>
what makes them tick.<br>
More machinations</p>

<p>than magic. Dark<br>
pastoral scenes<br>
and a stiffness</p>

<p>crowns the eaves.<br>
Clockmakers all carve<br>
the same male game</p>

<p>in their overhang.<br>
Reared buckhorns<br>
and alpha beasts &mdash;</p>

<p>They rule the ornate<br>
roost. And it’s a heavy<br>
pull on me. Those two</p>

<p>coniferous strung<br>
weights dangling<br>
their gonadal hang.</p>
