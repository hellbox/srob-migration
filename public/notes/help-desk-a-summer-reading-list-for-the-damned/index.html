<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p>

<p class="noindent">**I’m soooo tired of summer reading lists. What’s so special about summer? Can’t we all read in the winter too? In fact, isn’t winter *better* for reading, what with the incessant rain and all?
**</p>

<p><strong>And what’s up with all the sweetness-and-light? When I’m sitting by the lake, what I really want is something meaty — something to distract me from giant ball of radioactive gas beating down and the razor-sharp grains of sand worked into the nap of my beach towel.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You’re the only one I trust. What should I put on my summer reading list that reflects the inevitable heat-driven doom that we’re pushing our planet toward?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Warmly (too warmly) yours,**</p>

<p class="noindent">**Dottie, Chelan**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Dottie,</p>

<p class="noindent">My apologies for getting to your letter so late in the season – I volunteer with the Break a Wish Foundation and summer is our busiest time of the year. As you might have guessed from this column, I am devoted to helping the less fortunate – the clueless, the tasteless, the terminally ill – which includes telling little Bruno that no, Michael Jackson will not be the special guest at your final birthday party, but here, take this single Bedazzled rubber glove and a polaroid of a flawlessly circumcised penis instead.</p>

<p>You are correct — winter is the best time for reading, and many summer reading lists are as fatally flawed as marriage vows and little Bruno’s right atrium. Light fiction should be saved for January, when our will to wash ourselves is weakest and we spend hours idly contemplating where to dump our parents off to die with dignity once they are too old to amuse us.</p>

<p>Conversely, what people need during summer is not fluff; they need something to balance out the relentless optimism of the sun. Here are a few sometimes bleak, weird and gripping books I suggest for you: <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780374100261"><em>The Answers</em></a>, by Catherine Lacey, <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781940450025"><em>100 Apocalypses and Other Apocalypses</em></a> by Lucy Corin, and <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250062185"><em>The Sixth Extinction</em></a> by Elizabeth Kolbert.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
