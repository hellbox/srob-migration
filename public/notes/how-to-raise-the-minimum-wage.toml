Over [at my day-job blog](http://civicskunkworks.com/how-we-won-the-fight-for-15-in-seattle-and-whats-next/), Civic Skunk Works, I wrote about last night's launch party for local labor organizer David Rolf's new book about Seattle's $15 minimum wage battle. *The Fight for Fifteen* explains how we embraced $15 locally, and many of the major players behind the wage increase — Councilmember Kshama Sawant, fast food worker Martina Phelps, and venture capitalist (and, full disclosure, my boss) Nick Hanauer — were on stage to discuss what they learned and what's coming next. Go [take a look](http://civicskunkworks.com/how-we-won-the-fight-for-15-in-seattle-and-whats-next/).
