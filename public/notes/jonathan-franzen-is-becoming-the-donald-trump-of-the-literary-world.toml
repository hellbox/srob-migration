This is certainly a headline that exists in the world:

<blockquote>[Jonathan Franzen wanted to adopt an Iraqi orphan to better understand the young](http://mashable.com/2015/08/21/jonathan-franzen-iraqi-orphan/)</blockquote>

Franzen says his editor talked him out of this plan. This is the best case for editors that I have ever read in my entire life.
