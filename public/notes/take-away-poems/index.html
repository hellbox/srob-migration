<p>Hugo House is hosting a one-day poetry broadside workshop Saturday August 8, run by local poet <a href="http://www.jackstraw.org/programs/writers/WritersForum/06/writers/jt.shtml">J.T. Stewart</a>, and master typographer <a href="https://www.tdc.org/officers/john-d-berry/">John D. Berry</a>. Poets will walk away with printed broadsides of their work.</p>

<p>Broadsides were once the currency of the poetry underground. Learning how to design and print them is a great opportunity, especially if you&rsquo;ve never seen your work come to life on paper right before your eyes. Having this level of experience and guidance available to you is a rare opportunity.</p>
