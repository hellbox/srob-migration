Liam O'Brien at [Melville House looks at](http://www.mhpbooks.com/why-a-texas-bookstore-wants-you-to-bring-your-gun-shopping/) Texas booksellers who are trying to come to terms with the state's new open carry law. Many bookstores are banning guns:

<blockquote>I have always believed that bookstores are forums for all ideas, but I also understand that the free exchange of those ideas can be hindered (if not entirely obstructed) when one party in the conversation holds a deadly weapon.</blockquote>

And one enterprising bookseller is actively encouraging guns:

<blockquote>Brave New Books is offering a 10 percent discount to all customers open-carrying in their store.</blockquote>

I know where I'd rather shop.
