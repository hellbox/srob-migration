A rogue wave of old grief capsized me at the bar.

The night in my mouth had the names all wrong:<br>
Herodotus. 	  Herodotus.

My chair was upside down<br>
but I was making it look casual. 

Earlier, when my glasses flew off and his glasses flew off<br>
and they did a little orbit around each other<br>
before returning to our faces—<br>
but that was before Herodotus. 

Herodotus tells us:<br>
_Human happiness never continues long in one stay._

I report my old love in longhand.<br>
I report old grief in perfect sobbing penmanship.<br>
I report my flight from the bar as a series of not-falling,<br> 
bat-wing-like movements.

Logographers, I need you! Graffiti artists, I need you!<br>
Dancing man at the bus stop, I need you!

I have staggered free of the wreck of one year,<br>
I can surely come clear of another.
