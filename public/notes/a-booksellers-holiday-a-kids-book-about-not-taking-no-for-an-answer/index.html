<p>After reading <em>Iggy Peck, Architect</em> and <em>Rosie Revere, Engineer</em>, I was dying to read this one, because the series is wonderful for parents and kids. I think it’s got a great positive message: Even though someone tells you can’t do something, you can. That’s what this book does: it tells this girl’s story, about how she perseveres and becomes a scientist. I think it’s wonderful. I love it a lot.</p>
