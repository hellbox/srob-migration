<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Friday, December 15: Four Seattle Poets</strong></h5></p>
The last author reading at Elliott Bay Book Company for the year of 2017 is a stellar lineup of debut poets. You definitely know Jane Wong, whose <em>Overpour</em> was the first big debut of the year. And frequent readers of the site also know EJ Koh, whose <em>A Lesser Love</em> is a genius collection that spans love and war. Mita Mahato is a paper-cut cartoonist whose first collection, <em>In Between</em>, is a milestone in the small-but-growing field of poetry comics. You might not know Montreux Rotholtz or her debut collection, <em>Unmark</em>, and that’s okay. Every great reading has some element of discovery to it, doesn’t it?
