<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/24/dont-forget-to-celebrate-small-business-saturday/">I told you about</a> some local independent bookstores that you should visit on Small Business Saturday. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t buy books online, too! Below are three big sales from independent publishers just in time for Thanksgiving-weekend consumer madness. Buying directly from these publishers will help pay for more great new books in the coming year.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On Monday, Seattle publisher <a href="http://fantagraphics.com/flog/cybermonday/">Fantagraphics Books</a> is having a 40% off sale on everything.</p></li>
