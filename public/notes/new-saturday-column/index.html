<p>Later this morning we&rsquo;ll be debuting a new Saturday column called <em>Whatcha Reading?</em> We ask a notable and interesting figure to answer three questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What are you reading now?</li>
<li>What did you read last?</li>
<li>What are you reading next?</li>
</ol>

<p>Some will answer succinctly, and others will go on into greater detail. Everybody likes knowing what other people are reading. It&rsquo;s one of the most charming parts of seeing visiting authors: hearing about the books they are currently in love with.</p>

<p>It also suits a need on the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>, where we often talk about authors and books, but don&rsquo;t have a running series of recommendations. Just touching base with people every week can do just that. If you think of somebody who would be great for this, drop us a line at <a href="mailto:info@seattlereviewofbooks.com">info@seattlereviewofbooks.com</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a tradition here that we start a new Saturday column each year. For the first six months after launching we ran <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/rahawa-hailes-short-story-of-the-day-of-the-previous-week/" title="The Seattle Review of Books">Rahawa Haile&rsquo;s Short Story of the Day of the Previous Week</a> roundup, which re-posted the tweets Rahawa was posting on Twitter each day. In 2016 we invested $20 each week in crowdfunding with the <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/kickstarter-fund/" title="The Seattle Review of Books">Kickstarter Fund Project</a>. Of course, for the past year, we&rsquo;ve run <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/seattle-writing-prompts" title="The Seattle Review of Books">Seattle Writing Prompts</a>.</p>

<p>Our new column marks the end of weekly writing prompts, but not the end of the series. They&rsquo;ll be back as an irregular feature when the occasion hits. In the meantime, if you&rsquo;re lacking for inspiration (and you find them inspirational), you&rsquo;ll find<a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/seattle-writing-prompts" title="The Seattle Review of Books"> over fifty of them in the archive.</a></p>

<p>As always, we love hearing your thoughts. Reach out to us via the email above, on <a href="https://twitter.com/seattlereviewof" title="The Seattle Review of Books (@seattlereviewof) | Twitter">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/seattlereviewof" title="None">Facebook</a>.</p>
