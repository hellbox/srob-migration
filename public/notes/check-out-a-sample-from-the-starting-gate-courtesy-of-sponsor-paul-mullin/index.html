This week, the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> is sponsored by Paul Mullin, playwright, poet, and creator/curator of the Loud Mouth Lit reading series. We&rsquo;re infinitely grateful to Paul for supporting the site and for <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/">sharing a chapter from his memoir, <em>The Starting Gate</em>, with our readers</a>. The excerpt is a great standalone story: the down-and-dirty (or up-and-clean) on the dangers of washing windows on a New York highrise when you&rsquo;re a young writer with three jobs and no time to sleep. And it&rsquo;s an irresistible entry point for Mullin&rsquo;s no-holds-barred style.</p>

<p>Buy a copy of <em>The Starting Gate</em> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Gate-Cocktail-Working-Drinking-ebook/dp/B01B13Y8YI">here</a>. Or come out for this month&rsquo;s edition of Loud Mouth Lit, at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Bar on Tuesday night, to hear Mullin read — Lindy West is also on the marquee, so it should be a brilliant night for anger done funny — and pick up a copy while you&rsquo;re there.</p>

<p>Sponsors like Paul Mullin make the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> possible. Did you know <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/">you could sponsor us, as well</a>?
