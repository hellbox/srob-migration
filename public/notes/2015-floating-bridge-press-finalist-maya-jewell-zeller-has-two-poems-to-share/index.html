<p>Sponsor Floating Bridge Press is back to feature a great work from Maya Jewell Zeller, titled <em>Yesterday, the Bees</em>. Zeller&rsquo;s piece was a finalist in the 2015 chapbook competition, a work that looks at parenting, and being a part of a family.</p>

<p>We have <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">two poems from the work on our sponsors page for you to read</a>. Be sure to look, and click through to their website to find out more about Zeller&rsquo;s work, and the other chapbook winners. Thank you, Floating Bridge for your sponsorship!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">take a look at our open dates</a>. We&rsquo;d love to talk to you about opportunities to sponsor us. It&rsquo;s our way of making internet advertising something to look forward to.</p>
