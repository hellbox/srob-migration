        <p>This morning, Pioneer Square&rsquo;s Seattle Mystery Bookshop <a href="http://seattlemysteryblog.typepad.com/seattle_mystery/2016/01/save-seattle-mystery-bookshop.html">launched a GoFundMe campaign</a> &ldquo;to make sure the rent is completely paid off, all our suppliers are happy, and to restore missing titles and depleted series to our shelves.&rdquo; Their goal is to <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/seattlemystery">raise $50,000</a>. Rewards for the campaign include signed first editions, a noirish 1974 Michael Garmin sculpture, tote bags, and coffee cups.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about what makes Seattle Mystery Bookshop so great, we have a whole series of pieces explaining just that — they were our Bookstore of the Month back in September. We explained the <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/02/our-september-bookstore-of-the-month-is-seattle-mystery-bookshop/">unique pleasures of the shop</a>, their <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/09/the-recommendation-engine/">amazing propensity for finding just the right book for just the right person</a>, the way they <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/16/finding-the-inner-mystery-geek-in-all-of-us-since-1990/">seduce non-mystery readers into reading mysteries</a>, and we ran some <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/23/the-staff-of-seattle-mystery-bookshop-recommends-mysteries-for-people-who-think-they-hate-mysteries/">brilliant recommendations from their booksellers</a>.</p>

<p>If crowd-funding isn&rsquo;t your thing, stop by Seattle Mystery Bookshop — they&rsquo;re at 117 Cherry St — and pick up a few titles. Your purchase will be much appreciated. Here&rsquo;s hoping they&rsquo;ll stick around to introduce readers to the great mysteries for many decades to come.</p>
