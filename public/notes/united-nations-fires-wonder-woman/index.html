<p>Heidi MacDonald at <a href="http://www.comicsbeat.com/wonder-womans-un-ambassador-gig-is-over-following-petition/">the indispensible comics news blog The Beat</a> reports on a petition to unseat Wonder Woman as an honorary ambassador at the United Nations. <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/741/288/432/reconsider-the-choice-of-honorary-ambassador-for-the-empowerment-of-women-and-girls/">The petition</a> blasts Wonder Woman&rsquo;s &ldquo;overtly sexualized image&rdquo; for &ldquo;not [being] culturally encompassing or sensitive.&rdquo; It seems that the petition was successful — Wonder Woman is no longer considered to be a UN ambassador, though it&rsquo;s unclear how any fictional character can serve as an ambassador in the first place.</p>

<p>One issue the petition did not cite that seems relevant: it&rsquo;s highly squicky that the United Nation decided to privilege a corporate intellectual property with this kind of platform. MacDonald says that DC Comics had plans for the ambassadorship leading up to the launch of the <em>Wonder Woman</em> film next year. I&rsquo;m all for Wonder Woman as a symbol — the fact that she was on the cover of the first issue of <em>Ms. Magazine</em> was a huge moment in feminist pop cultural history — but there&rsquo;s a difference between celebrating a superhero&rsquo;s folk status and promoting brand awareness for a multinational entertainment conglomerate. The idea of an international leadership role for women serving as synergy for a blockbuster movie is more than a little distasteful.</p>
