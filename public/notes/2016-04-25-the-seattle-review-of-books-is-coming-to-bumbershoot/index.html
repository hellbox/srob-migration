<p>The rumors are true: we at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> are incredibly excited to be presenting a show at Bumbershoot this year! When Bumbershoot asked us to program an hour on their Words and Ideas stage, we decided to ask three Seattle-area poets known for their awesome performance skills to share a stage for the first time ever. Happily, all three said yes.</p>

<p><strong>EJ Koh</strong> <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/23/started-from-the-bottom-now-were-here/">wowed us at last year&rsquo;s Lit Crawl</a> with her clarity, stage presence, and incisive poems. She&rsquo;s also <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/06/korean-war/">published a poem called &ldquo;Korean War&rdquo;</a> on our Tuesday poetry chain.</p>

<p><strong>Robert Lashley</strong> is one of the most compelling performers we&rsquo;ve ever seen. When he reads, every atom in the room stands still; his fiery delivery and his passionate poems — if you haven&rsquo;t yet read his collection <a href="http://hillarysusz.com/2014/08/10/bellingham-poet-robert-lashley-becomes-a-national-best-seller-with-his-debute-collection-of-poems-the-homeboy-songs/"><em>The Homeboy Songs</em></a>, you should amend that mistake right now — are unforgettable.</p>

<p>And <strong>Sherman Alexie</strong> is, plainly and unhyperbolically, the single best reader in the Pacific Northwest. He&rsquo;s riotously funny and brilliant and he brings his poems to life with a singular energy. Alexie has been reading in Seattle for decades now, and he still commands rooms with his inviting humor and cutting observations. With on-the-rise talents like Koh and Lashley on the bill, Alexie was clearly the only worthy headliner; we&rsquo;re so grateful that he agreed to take part in this show.</p>

<p>This is going to be a memorable one, folks. What happens when you put three show-stoppers on a single bill? Damned if I know, but I sure am excited to find out. Bumbershoot is happening on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, September 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. <a href="http://bumbershoot.com/">Tickets go on sale Friday at 10 am</a>. We&rsquo;ll see you there.</p>
