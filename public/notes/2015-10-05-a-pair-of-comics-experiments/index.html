        <p><strong>1</strong>. Saturday, October 3rd was 24-Hour Comics day, in which cartoonists write and draw a full comic book in a single day. Local cartoonist Henry Chamberlain just <a href="http://comicsgrinder.com/2015/10/04/24-hour-comics-day-2015-hotel-hotel-and-the-fremont-troll/">posted his 24-hour comic</a>, which stars the Fremont Troll, at the <a href="http://comicsgrinder.com/2015/10/04/24-hour-comics-day-2015-hotel-hotel-and-the-fremont-troll/">Comics Grinder</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>. Over at <em>Okey Panky</em>, <a href="http://okeypanky.com/post/130547990309/comic-draw-two-panels-by-isaac-cates">Isaac Cates contributes a handful of comic strips</a> based on a comics game of his own invention: select two comics panels from a deck of previously-created panels. Your job is to illustrate two panels that connect them. (My favorite part of the game: in the end, all four panels, including the middle two you&rsquo;ve created, go back into the deck, thereby adding to the possibilities for future installments.) What follows is a wonderful meditation on poetry, comics, and the connection between the two. The form and content of Cates&rsquo;s &ldquo;essay&rdquo; mirror each other beautifully.</p>

<p>(<em>This post has been updated to reflect the fact that Cates is the inventor of the panel-selection game.</em>)</p>
