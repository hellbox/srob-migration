        <p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Wednesday October 19th: Margin Shift</strong></h5></p>
Four poets — Elizabeth J. Cohen, Natasha Kochicheril Moni, Kelle Grace Gaddis, and Nadine Antoinette Maestas — read new work at the Seattle poetry collective’s latest gathering. Gaddis and Maestas are both UW graduates, Colen is a teacher at Western Washington University, and Moni was published by fabulous local press Two Sylvias. *Common AREA Maintenance, 2125 2nd Ave, (253) 224-0746. <a href="http://commonartspace.com">http://commonartspace.com</a>. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *</p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Thursday October 20th: Libraroke</strong></h5></p>
 If you’re looking for a rare karaoke tune, the wizards at ggnzla Karaoke are your best bet in town. (They have “Mama Said Knock You Out” on rotation.) Tonight, you can join Seattle Public librarians  with booze and “bookish” karaoke. Drink literary-themed cocktails and talk books until you’re slurring your words. *Bar Sue, 1407 14th Ave, 328-0888, <a href="http://spl.org">http://spl.org</a>. Free. 21+. 9 p.m. *</p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Friday October 21st: <em>Overpour</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Seattle poet Jane Wong is a phenomenal talent. She’s young for a poet, but she’s already won a ton of awards and recognitions (the Stanley Kunitz Memorial Prize, the Kundiman fellowship) and tonight she’s debuting her first full-length poetry collection, <em>Overpour</em>. Tonight’s the night when a promising, impressive talent finally becomes a celebrated author.
<em>Hugo House, 1021 Columbia St., 322-7030, <a href="http://hugohouse.org">http://hugohouse.org</a>. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.</em></p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Saturday October 22nd: <em>The Elements</em> and *Rock Is Not Dead</strong>*</h5></p>
See our Literary Event of the Week column for more details.</p>

<p><h5><strong>Sunday October 23rd: <em>Les Amants</em> Book Brunch</strong></h5></p>
<em>Word Lit Zine</em> publisher Jekeva Phillips celebrates the launch of her new poetry collection, <em>Les Amants: Lovers and Other Strangers</em>, with a Sunday brunch reading featuring mimosas and pastries. I’ve been writing about literary events in this city for over a decade now, and this, weirdly, is the first brunch-themed book launch I can recall.*Common AREA Maintenance, 2125 2nd Ave, (253) 224-0746. <a href="http://commonartspace.com">http://commonartspace.com</a>.

<h5><strong>Monday October 24th: <em>The Wangs vs. the World</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Debut authors are storming the gates at Elliott Bay this week: Brit Bennett reads from her much-acclaimed <em>The Mothers</em> on Tuesday, but for my money Jade Chang’s novel about a Chinese-American family that suffers a streak of bad luck is the one to beat. Her reading tonight should be funny, smart, and fascinating.  <em>Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, <a href="http://elliottbaybook.com ">http://elliottbaybook.com </a>. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. </em></p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Tuesday October 25th: #Journalismsowhite</strong></h5></p>
Seattle has its fair share of intelligent, curious, thoughtful journalists, but GodDAMN is the Seattle journalism scene incredibly white. Like, blindingly so. Tonight, a panel of journalists from outlets like the <em>Globalist</em>, the <em>South Seattle Emerald</em>, and <em>Grist</em> get together to discuss what this homogeneity means and how to diversify the scene. <em>Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m. </em></p>
