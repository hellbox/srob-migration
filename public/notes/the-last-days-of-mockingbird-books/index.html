<p>We <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/08/01/mockingbird-books-to-close-at-the-end-of-august/">told you back at the beginning of the month</a> that Greenlake kids&rsquo; store Mockingbird Books would be closing on August 27th. That means you have less than week to pay your respects and pick up some childrens&rsquo; books on discount. <a href="http://komonews.com/embed/news/local/customers-on-closure-of-popular-green-lake-bookstore-its-sad-to-lose-it">KOMO ran a video about</a> Mockingbird&rsquo;s last days.</p>
