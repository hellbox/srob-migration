<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**The manager at a local bookstore complained to me about Seattle’s $15 minimum wage. He said it was impossible to run a business with a wage that high. He did make one good point: restaurants and most retail stores can raise the prices of goods they sell to pay for a higher wage, but books tend to have the prices printed right on them. On the other hand, I think everyone should have the right to a living wage: especially bookstore employees. I pretty much didn’t say anything. Should I have been more forceful? Should I argue the point again?**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Patty,</p>
 

<p class="noindent">In the age of Trump, I don't believe it's worthwhile or effective to be forceful in disagreements. What is worthwhile is being reasonable, which is a perversion of my nature. Yet sometimes I try.</p>

<p>For instance, if someone pointed out that &ldquo;books tend to have prices printed right on them,&rdquo; I might respond with, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what stickers were invented for.&rdquo; Or if someone complained that it was &ldquo;impossible to run a business with a wage that high,&rdquo; I might inquire what they thought their own time was worth – less than $15 an hour in <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/beer-burgers-and-haircuts-seattle-hits-new-high-for-cost-of-living-and-its-not-just-housing/">the sixth most expensive city in the nation</a>?</p>

<p>And then, before I went back to that bookstore, I would consult my human friend Silly P – who is a big-brained intellect, voracious reader, and somewhat of an expert on Seattle&rsquo;s $15 minimum wage – and ask him what other helpful talking points I could throw at this misguided bookstore manager in lieu of discretely lighting his body hair on fire.</p>

<p>Since you may not have a Silly P in your life, I took the liberty of consulting mine for you. Here is what he added:</p>

<blockquote><p>The minimum-wage law was designed and instituted in such a way as to give small business an advantage over the corporate chains – the wage increases at a slower rate for independent businesses with less than five hundred employees.</p>

<p>That delay is important for a few reasons. One: it allows businesses a lot of time to plan for the increases. Two: it provides time for the increased spending power of a lot of Seattleites who were previously making 8 or 9 bucks an hour to take hold. Workers in Seattle have more money to spend, now that the wage has increased. I know personally that a few local bookstores had their most profitable Christmases ever last year, and I bet much of that spending can be attributed directly to the waiters and dishwashers and retail workers who had more money to spend.</p></blockquote>

<p>That said, both Silly P and I agree with you – Seattle has a lot of creative, thriving bookstores, and those bookstores wouldn&rsquo;t exist without booksellers. Those booksellers deserve a living wage; they deserve to be able to afford to live in their city.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
