<p>Seattle-area writer Paul Mullin just announced that he&rsquo;s kicking off 2017 with a new reading series called Loud Mouth Lit. Admission is free, it happens at Greenlake&rsquo;s St. Andrew’s Bar and Grill, and the first reading happens on January 31st at 8 pm, with new outings on the last Tuesday of every month thereafter.</p>

<p>Loud Mouth Lit looks to be a nice blend of literary and theater influences, bringing together Mullin&rsquo;s experience as a Stranger Genius Award-winning playwright and a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theStartingGateBook/">memoirist</a>. Mullin says upcoming readers include &ldquo;Seattle’s favorite playwright/ puppeteer raconteur Scot Augustson&rdquo; and &ldquo;Playwright, screenwriter, and smut virtuoso Kelleen Conway Blanchard.&rdquo;</p>
