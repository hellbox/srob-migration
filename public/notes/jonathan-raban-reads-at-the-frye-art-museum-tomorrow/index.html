<p>Jonathan Raban is the closest thing the Seattle literary scene has to a <em>paterfamilias</em>. His brilliant, incisive writing taught us how to think about the city around us, and he&rsquo;s influenced countless local writers from Lesley Hazleton to Charles Mudede.</p>

<p>Raban has been out of the spotlight for the last few years due to health-related issues, but I&rsquo;m excited to report that he&rsquo;s <a href="http://fryemuseum.org/calendar/event/6203/">reading at the Frye tomorrow afternoon</a>, from 3 to 4 pm. It&rsquo;s free. I can&rsquo;t recall the last time Raban gave a reading; this is a big, important event for literary Seattle.</p>
