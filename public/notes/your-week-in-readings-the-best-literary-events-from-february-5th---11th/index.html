<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday, February 5: Thrilling Tales**</h5></p>

<p>The downtown Seattle Public Library hosts a lunch-period storytime for adults two times a month. It’s a chance for grownups to leave the office, relax and hand over their attention to someone else for a while. Todays’ short story selection was written by San Diego sci-fi author Greg Bear. It’s titled &ldquo;Blood Music,” and it’s one of his beset-known works.
