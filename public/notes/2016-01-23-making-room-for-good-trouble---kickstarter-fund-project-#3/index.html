<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">_[Making Room for Good Trouble](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/microcosmpublishing/making-room-for-good-trouble)_. We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Microcosm Publishing](http://microcosmpublishing.com).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>Microcosm is an independent, punk-inspired book publisher. We're about to turn 20. This is our story.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    We love seeing indie publishers, especially ones as long-lived as Microcosm &mdash; they started in 1996 as a record label and distributer &mdash; and especially ones in the Pacific Northwest &mdash; they're based in Portland. After twenty some years, they have published over 350 books, have nearly three million books in print, and are still going strong. 
</p>

<p>So why throw a Kickstarter? Well, their founder Joe Biel wrote a book about his experience in publishing, and it&rsquo;s coming out soon. They&rsquo;re trying to clear space in their warehouse, so the Kickstarter is about selling backstock to make room.</p>

<p>So the rewards are all about getting you some books. In fact, in one of the best deals on Kickstarter, if you back for $50 you get a signed copy of Joe&rsquo;s new book <em>Good Trouble</em>, plus 24 more books. Whoa. That&rsquo;s an average price of $1.90 each. Total score &mdash; there&rsquo;s some great stuff in there.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">Get the 24 pack! But also, you have to love Microcosm's message. On their website they say "Microcosm Publishing empowers readers to make positive changes in their lives and in the world around them. Microcosm emphasizes skill-building, showing hidden histories, and fostering creativity through challenging conventional publishing wisdom with books and bookettes about DIY skills, food, gender, self-care, social justice, and art." </p>

<p>And 50% of the books they publish are by women. Yes!</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">5 days to go, and they've more than doubled their goal of $3,000, so they're gonna make it. Just get in on this for the 24 book deal. Seriously!</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
