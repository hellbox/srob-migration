<p>Last year, the Seattle Public Library and Seattle Arts and Lectures teamed up to promote a popular Summer Book Bingo program. It was such a success — my social media was at times overwhelmed with #BookBingoNW hashtags — that they&rsquo;re doing it again. <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fshelftalkblog.files.wordpress.com%2F2016%2F05%2Fbookbingo_04c.pdf">This year&rsquo;s PDF bingo card</a> includes categories like &ldquo;Local author,&rdquo; &ldquo;#WeNeedDiverseBooks,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Recommended by a librarian.&rdquo; If you black out the whole card, you&rsquo;ll be entered to win a library of books from Seattle Arts and Lectures along with tickets to the 2016-2017 season. If you do a standard bingo column, you&rsquo;ll be entered to win a $30 gift certificate at a local independent bookseller. The deadline is Tuesday, September 6th.</p>
