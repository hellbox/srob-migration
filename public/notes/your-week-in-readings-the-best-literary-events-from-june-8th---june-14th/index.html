<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday June 8: *Homegoing* Reading
**</h5></p> 
It’s hard to turn anyone’s head with a dust jacket blurb these days, but the rare appearance of a Ta-Nehisi Coates blurb on Yaa Gyasi’s debut novel *Homegoing* — calling the book an “inspiration” and citing its “so fully realized, so elegantly carved” characters — is a rare meaningful instance. It announces this book as something worth your time. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *

<p><p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday June 13: Leveraging Female Political Power
**</h5></p>
It’s clear that women will decide the election this November, either by showing up to vote against Donald Trump or by staying home out of disgust at the electoral process. <em>Time</em> magazine reporter Jay Newton-Small will share everything she knows about American women and democracy—from Hillary Clinton’s dealmaking to surprising demographic information—in a talk tonight.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday June 14: <em>Sweet Lamb of Heaven</em> Reading
**</h5></p>
Lydia Millett’s delightfully creepy novels are full of sticky secrets and missing people and monstrous obsessions. Tonight she’s joined by Seattle’s own Stacey Levine—herself no stranger to bizarre and uncomfortable fictions. This pairing makes so much sense it’s ridiculous; these two writers will either become best friends or they’ll light each other on fire.
