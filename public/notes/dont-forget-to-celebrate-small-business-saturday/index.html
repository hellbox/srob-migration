<p>I mentioned this in <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/23/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-november-23-29/">Your Week in Readings</a>, but I thought it could use a little elaborating here: the Saturday after Thanksgiving is <strong>Small Business Saturday</strong>, when consumers are reminded to turn their backs on malls and chain stores and online retailers and visit the stores that help make their communities vibrant, interesting places to live.</p>

<p>Even better, local independent bookstores are celebrating <strong>Indies First</strong>, a program (invented by Sherman Alexie) in which authors work as booksellers at their favorite bookstores for a day. In short, you can go support small business, get a book signed, and get a personalized recommendation from your favorite Seattle authors. Here&rsquo;s a list of all the Indies First participants that I&rsquo;ve found (in alphabetical order) and a list of the authors appearing at the stores.
