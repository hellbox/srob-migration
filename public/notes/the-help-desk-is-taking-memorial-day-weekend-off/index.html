<p>Our advice columnist, Cienna Madrid, is taking the weekend off to celebrate Memorial Day and do a little traveling. Hopefully, you&rsquo;re doing the same.</p>

<p>If you have any questions of literary etiquette — from the proper treatment of rude library patrons to what to do about loved ones whose lips move when they read — please drop Cienna a line at advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com. And of course you can always <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-help-desk/">read the archives of the column</a> right here on the site.</p>
