<p>PEN America <a href="https://pen.org/press-release/jasper-johns-rosanne-cash-hanya-yanagihara-200000-americans-call-congress-save-federal-arts-funding/">notes that</a> a number of organizations and authors are protesting Donald Trump&rsquo;s proposed budget, which cuts funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p>

<blockquote>America’s most prominent writers and artists across a wide array of genres–including painter Jasper Johns, actor John Lithgow, singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash, cartoonist Art Spiegelman, and novelists Hanya Yanagihara, Salman Rushdie, Neil Gaiman, and Anne Tyler–are [leading a petition](https://www.signherenow.org/petition/save-endowments/pen/) to protect federal funding for the arts that supports literature, scholarly research, visual arts, dance, theater, museums, and arts education programs around the country to ensure that all Americans can access cultural works and activities.</blockquote>

<p>PEN America, of course, is a wonderful organization. Last month <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/02/13/paul-auster-on-making-noise-in-the-age-of-trump/">I talked with Paul Auster about why PEN is so important</a>, and what an artist&rsquo;s responsibility should be in the age of Trump.</p>
