<p>The Vixen pinks his way through whiskers,<br>
strikes a nice plié,<br>
then knocks a shot of Jäger back,<br>
and drops some Fourier.</p>

<p>The shaven Lion shyly strides<br>
beside his own conceit:<br>
a guileless wilding<br>
twice defiled, but innocent and sweet.</p>

<p>Mama Panda and her Pup<br>
(wily as Montaigne)<br>
splay their limbs in slick abandon,<br>
rolling through the rain.</p>

<p>prise.</p>

<p>The Kangaroo who used to wear<br>
a Fox&rsquo;s gold lapel<br>
casts himself on infant seas<br>
and rides each roll and swell</p>

<p>Rainbow Rat, the dayglo champ<br>
of pan-harmonium<br>
wriggles in a bedsty tizzy,<br>
nursing at his thumb.</p>

<p>The Folf-cum-Husky&rsquo;s snugly tucked<br>
and tangled up in blue<br>
and white and glows so bright<br>
he turns the old moon new.</p>

<p>Even Wolves, who play at stern<br>
and sober countenance,<br>
lose themcells in padded selves<br>
and capillary dance:</p>

<p>though shadows blaze through every day<br>
and coruscate the night,<br>
we learn to see beyond the darkness<br>
by each other&rsquo;s light.</p>
