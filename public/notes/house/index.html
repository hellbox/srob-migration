<p>&mdash; <em>after Alison Prine</em></p>

<p>I was here before the house came down. <br>
I ran up its carpeted stairs,<br>
my feet bare; I stood dripping<br>
in a towel just outside the bedroom door;<br>
I daydreamt of making a mural<br>
of the hallway wall,<br>
my hands full of tacks and yarn.</p>

<p>I came along the backcountry road,<br>
its tar hot and melting in the August sun.<br>
I passed a boy playing crow<br>
in a cornfield, daring a rifle to shoot.</p>

<p>I was here before the house came down.<br>
My feet wore holes in the carpeted stairs.<br>
I wanted this place to remember me,<br>
though I didn’t know I’d leave it &mdash;
or rather, it left me.<br>
I was the one calling out its name.</p>
