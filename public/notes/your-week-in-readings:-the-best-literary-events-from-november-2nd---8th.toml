**MONDAY** [Elliott Bay Book Company](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/andrea-kleine-mattilda-bernstein-sycamore) kicks off our week in readings with *Calf*, **Andrea Kleine**’s debut novel. Here’s an introductory note you’ll find before the first page of *Calf*:

<p class="image">![](/webhook-uploads/1446264520949/Screen%20Shot%202015-10-30%20at%208.33.57%20PM.png)</p>

 If that doesn't grab your attention, I don't know what will. Kleine will be appearing with delightful Seattle author **Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore**, who will read new work.

**TUESDAY** **Marion Nestle**, who is  a nutrition expert, reads at [Town Hall](https://townhallseattle.org/event/marion-nestle/) from her book *Soda Politics*. It’s about how the soda industry has willfully caused “increased rates of obesity, risk for Type 2 Diabetes, [and] poor dental health” in people all over the world. She also prescribes some solutions and highlights some anti-soda campaigns that have worked around the world.

**WEDNESDAY** Okay, it’s time for a programming note: this week is **incredibly loaded down with great-looking events**. I could highlight three or four events for every night this week — for instance, **Sloane Crosley** is reading at Elliott Bay Book Company tonight. But tonight at the [Seattle Public Library](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/orhan-pamuk-walter-g-andrews-seattle-public-central-library), **Orhan Pamuk** will be reading from his newest book, *A Strangeness in My Mind*. Crosley is one of the funniest writers at work today, but Pamuk has won the Nobel Prize for Literature, so he obviously comes out on top.

**THURSDAY** At [Hugo House](http://hugohouse.org/event/cheap-wine-poetry-4/)  it’s time for the last Cheap Wine and Poetry of the year. Your readers tonight are *Poetry Northwest*’s **Kevin Craft**, memoirist **Nicole Hardy**, self-professed “creative heartist” **Nikkita Oliver**, and the indomitable **Ed Skoog**. Wine, as always, is $1 a glass.


**FRIDAY** Remember what I said about every night of the week being overstuffed with events? The **Carrie Brownstein and Maria Semple** reading at [The Neptune](http://www.stgpresents.org/tickets/alphabetical/event/1301/) is very likely to have sold out by now, so let’s direct our attention to a smaller, very worthy event: at [Left Bank Books](https://www.facebook.com/events/1624864237775697/), Vancouver poets **Kevin Spenst and Jeff Steudel** will read from their latest books. Spenst’s debut collection is riddled with pop culture and the landscape of Vancouver. It’s titled *Jabbering with Bing Bong*. Steudel’s *Foreign Park* is about the history and ecology of the Fraser River. It’s not every night you get to attend a reading at Left Bank Books; go celebrate one of Seattle's best bookstores.

**SATURDAY** [Town Hall Scholar in residence **Brangien Davis**](https://townhallseattle.org/event/brangien-davis/), who was until recently the arts and culture editor of *Seattle* magazine, will give a tour  of Town Hall’s hidden gem, “an Austin Universal Air Chest, a 2023-pipe organ that was installed in 1923.” The organ hasn’t worked in a long time, but Davis will investigate the way it’s blended into the building, and she’ll talk about what it might take to bring the organ back to life.

**SUNDAY** At [Benaroya Hall](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/gloria-steinem-cheryl-strayed-benaroya-hall-0) tonight, **Gloria Steinem** will present her new memoir, *My Life on the Road*. She will be interviewed by **Cheryl Strayed**, and Seattle singer/songwriter **Hollis Wong-Wear** will perform new music. This is obviously going to be a very special evening.
