<p><h5><strong>Friday, November 10th: <em>Fresh Complaint</em> Reading</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Jeffrey Eugenides is a stone-cold genius writer of novels. If you haven’t read Middlesex, you’re missing one of the finest American novels of the last twenty years; you’ll likely be hooked from the very first description of a fire tearing along a waterfront. Tonight, Eugenides breaks a long silence with a short story collection titled Fresh Complaint. He appears in conversation with Mary Ann Gwinn, who is no longer the Seattle Times book editor but who is still one of the city’s foremost literary experts. </p>
