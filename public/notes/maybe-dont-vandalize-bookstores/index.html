<blockquote>A Denver-area store called Isis Books & Gifts wants the world to know its name comes from the Egyptian goddess of healing and motherhood and it isn't run by terrorists.</blockquote>

<p>Isis Books &amp; Gifts has been vandalized five times in the last year, presumably because of, as Isis owner John Harrison told the Associated Press, &ldquo;some ignorant people believing that somehow the terrorists have a store, a gift store, in the middle of Denver, Colorado.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/isisAnchalee/status/666718100377628673">amount of stupid in America this week</a> is truly staggering. This story came to me <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/living/religion/article45323835.html">via the <em>Idaho Statesman</em></a>, which — gasp! — has &ldquo;<em>IS</em>&rdquo; in its name. Everybody riot!</p>
