<p>Rushing toward the ocean tongue<br>
Along the lip of land</p>

<p>I am what my friends feared</p>

<p>Grit traded in for grains of sand<br>
My city soil scattered in Northwest winds</p>

<p>Twice despised for behavior unbecoming&mdash;</p>

<p>Unable to leave the cascade light<br>
Unwilling to claim the shadowed coo of pigeonâ€™s songs as my only note.</p>
