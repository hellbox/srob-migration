<p>I came late to cartoonist Rich Tommaso&rsquo;s work - the first comic of his that I read was the funny-animal Tintin pastiche <em>Spy Seal</em> - but I think I&rsquo;m falling in love. His art is so clean, his storytelling so economical, that it seems like it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before one of the mainstream publishers shows up on his front lawn with a dump truck of money and forces him to start drawing Batman for a living. Tommaso is an artist who is so unique that the comics industry is bound to try to crush him into something they can more easily manipulate.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I picked up the first issue of Tommaso&rsquo;s latest series, <em>Dry County</em>. It&rsquo;s a sunny Miami noir story about a guy who meets a woman and falls into really deep shit really quickly. (Sidebar: does any noir ever take place in a dark and rainy city anymore? Seems like every noir nowadays is located in Florida or California, and is <em>always</em> described with the word &ldquo;sunbaked.&rdquo;) Tommaso is using a different style here than the slick European look of <em>Spy Seal</em>: <em>Dry County</em> looks almost as though it&rsquo;s drawn by Dan Clowes. Every face is a little bit…*off*…with too-small eyes or a crooked nose or a smile that twists the wrong way across someone&rsquo;s cheek.</p>

<p>The narrator, a cartoonist named Lou Rossi, is a misanthrope. He lurks around Miami, sweating too much and trying to drink himself to some sense of peace. Then, he runs into someone in a laundry room. Her. &ldquo;A blonde goddess,&rdquo; Rossi calls her. Of course, there&rsquo;s trouble. She&rsquo;s in an unhappy relationship, and it&rsquo;s been a long time since Rossi&rsquo;s been in a relationship, and things start to go bad quick.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing too original in the plot, but every page of <em>Dry County</em> brings a new delight with it. Rossi has a friend named Robert, for instance, who seems to have wandered in from a pornographic Popeye cartoon a few books over. The opening splash page of Rossi wandering around a rave is practically the dictionary definition of what it feels like to be alone in a crowd.  And a gorgeous two-panel sequence of Rossi day-drinking on a porch as he stares out onto a pastel-colored Miami street will leave you drooling.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know where <em>Dry County</em> is going, but Tommaso has proven to be such a phenomenal talent that I expect the book to keep up this delight-on-every-page spirit until the bitter - and no doubt sunbaked - end.</p>
