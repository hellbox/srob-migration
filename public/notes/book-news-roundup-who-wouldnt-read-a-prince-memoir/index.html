<li><p>Prince is <a href="http://www.vogue.com/13418497/prince-memoir-announcement/">publishing a memoir</a>. We are all very excited about this, but we hope that he will use the letter &ldquo;I&rdquo; rather than his usual pictograph of an eye, because that will get very tiring very fast. Same thing with &ldquo;to&rdquo; and &ldquo;2.&rdquo;</p></li>
