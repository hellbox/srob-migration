<p>We’re on a roof taking in the view. You<br>
throw something over the edge. You don’t know<br>
how to count into a million pieces. You don’t<br>
know that gone is defined by what you still have<br>
to live with. You want to see where it went<br>
and it’s my job to tell you these things<br>
so I show you, my shoulders and hands tightening<br>
as I bend us into that irrevocable space.<br>
You reach your hands out, straining<br>
against my hold. In this moment I’m capable<br>
of anything, which reminds me of yesterday,<br>
the cup of tea I held steady as I tiptoed<br>
toward my chair. The few drops escaping anyway<br>
onto my skin. My hand opening. I remember<br>
the cup breaking, how it woke you<br>
from your nap, how my quiet was gone<br>
even before it began. And now we’re here,<br>
both looking down, and I’m that capable of anything.</p>
