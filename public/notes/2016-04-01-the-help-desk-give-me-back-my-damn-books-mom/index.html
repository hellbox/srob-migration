<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

<p><strong>My aunt and I are avid readers and tend to trade books back and forth. If my mom (her sister) is there when my aunt returns one of my books and hears us talking about it, she always says &ldquo;sounds interesting, can I borrow it?&rdquo; But every time, sure enough, if I stop by my mom&rsquo;s house, the books are sitting in her front door staging area&hellip; you know, the spot where she puts things that she wants to remember to take with her when she leaves. She will keep my books for up to 3 months then return them and admit she &ldquo;never got around&rdquo; to reading them. The last time she did this I said &ldquo;Mom, let&rsquo;s cut out the middle man here&rdquo;&hellip;and I wouldn&rsquo;t let her borrow them. My aunt thinks I should apologize. What do you think?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Georgina, Federal Way**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Georgina,</p>

<p>I met a woman once – let&rsquo;s call her Jaustiny – whose mother sat her down at the tender age of 14 and told her that she was leaving the family to go find herself. Not only was she tired of being a mother, she&rsquo;d decided that she really liked the name Jaustiny so she was legally changing her name to the name she&rsquo;d bequeathed on her daughter. Then New Jaustiny peaced out to San Francisco, bought herself new tits and realized her dream of being a childless waitress/artist named Jaustiny with sexy breast-induced back issues. The psychological mindfuck of that aside, her mother&rsquo;s new identity created a lot of weird burdens in Original Jaustiny&rsquo;s life as she grew up – her mother developed a criminal record stemming from a brief career as a meth chef and had most recently stolen OJs identity and ruined her credit by buying matching Harleys for herself and her new boyfriend, all of which OJ had to account for.</p>

<p>OJ told me this story at a bbq. Ten feet away stood my own mother, who was evaluating some cowboy she&rsquo;d just met for the quality of his sperm (for me. Always for me). As I watched her inspect his gums for disease I thought, &ldquo;that old broad ain&rsquo;t so bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Your complaint is that your mother borrows books that you and your aunt have already read but she doesn&rsquo;t read them, correct? How does this actually impact you if you&rsquo;ve already read the books? Your mom wants to feel included in the conversations and closeness you share with your aunt but she sucks at the follow-through. That is a harmless annoyance stemming from love.</p>

<p>Be sweet to your mom. Apologize. Let her borrow all the books she&rsquo;s guaranteed to never read and be thankful she&rsquo;s not a Harley-riding meth chef named Georgina.</p>

<p class="noindent">KISSES,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
