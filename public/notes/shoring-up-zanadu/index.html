<p>Zanadu Comics, the 41-year-old comics shop on 3rd Avenue downtown, has launched a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/zanadu-comics">crowdfunding campaign on GoFundMe</a> to raise $80,000 to keep the lights on and the doors open. The shop cites &ldquo;increased rent costs, and unfortunate city developments which includes a forced relocation due to building renovation late next year&rdquo; as the reason for the campaign. It&rsquo;s especially heartwarming to see that Pike Place Market comics shop Golden Age Collectables, has donated $500 to the campaign, leaving a comment that &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in this together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the last two decades, Zanadu has greatly expanded their independent and local comics selection, transforming from a pretty good spot to fill your weekly comics fix to a phenomenally well-stocked comics bookstore that I&rsquo;d recommend to anyone. If you&rsquo;re allergic to crowdfunding campaigns, I&rsquo;d urge you to drop by Zanadu for a visit, see what they&rsquo;ve been up to lately, and show your support the old-fashioned way: by buying books off the shelves.</p>
