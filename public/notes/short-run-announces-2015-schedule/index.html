<p>You already know that the Short Run small press &amp; comix expo is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/514625295380757/">happening on Halloween</a> this year. But they&rsquo;ve just announced their schedule for the month of October, and there&rsquo;s some great stuff happening in the lead-in to the festival. First up, on October 8th, Short Run goes to the Capitol Hill artwalk with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/874259452654996/">an art show at Joe Bar</a> featuring comics artists from Seattle, LA, Chicago, and Toronto. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/787266681382495/">On the 28th</a>, they&rsquo;ll be hosting special festival guests Charles Forsman and Melissa Mendes at the Capitol Hill branch of the library. On the 30th, they&rsquo;re having <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/122990034717614/">a pre-festival funk at Fantagraphics Bookstore &amp; Gallery in Georgetown</a> with an art show featuring art from Forsman and Mendes and Jim Woodring, who is the most brilliant comics artist in Seattle. And on Halloween night, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1656217527988606/">they&rsquo;re hosting a costume party</a> with musical guests Your Heart Breaks and Mommy Long Legs, along with &ldquo;a troupe of <strong>bizarre papier-mâché monsters</strong> by artist and musician Kelly Sorbel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Short Run is a celebration of Seattle&rsquo;s intentionally small and hand-made literary art scene, and their programming accentuates that aesthetic; they&rsquo;re accessible (most events are free) and energetic and fun. You should make sure to block out some time in your busy October to celebrate.</p>
