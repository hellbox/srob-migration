<p>Berger Books, the new editor-driven imprint from Portland publisher Dark Horse Comics, is something new in the world of comics. It&rsquo;s a bet that readers of comics actually care about editors - or even really understand what comics editors <em>do</em>, for that matter. But to be fair, Karen Berger is one of the most successful editors in comics history: she created DC Comics&rsquo;s wildly successful Vertigo line, which created the template for modern mature-readers comics.</p>

<p>And now that Vertigo has largely disappeared, maybe there&rsquo;s an underserved audience that will flock to Berger Books. I certainly hope so; based on the one book from Berger that I&rsquo;ve read - writer Mat Johnson and artist Warren Pleece&rsquo;s <em>Incognegro: Renaissance</em>, the first issue of which published just last week - this is a line that&rsquo;s deserving of a very large audience.</p>

<em>Renaissance</em> is a prequel to the Vertigo comic <em>Incognegro</em>, about a light-skinned Black reporter who can pass for white in 1930s New York City. (You don&rsquo;t have to have read the first book to understand this new one.) It&rsquo;s the first issue of a five-issue mystery story, and it&rsquo;s a masterful example of storytelling economy.</p>

<p><em>Renaissance</em> opens with our hero, Zane Pinchback, attending an un-segregated party in honor of a new novel about Harlem written by a white author. The publisher praises the author for &ldquo;braving streets of Harlem rarely seen by white eyes,&rdquo; which causes all the Black eyes in the house to roll violently back in their skulls. (&ldquo;Another hand for the great white warrior, back from safari,&rdquo; one Black partygoer blurts as he chugs on a bottle of wine.)</p>

<p>Johnson and Pleece elegantly set the stage here: they walk us through the party, introduce us to all the suspects, and then establish a splashy murder of a surprising victim before the book hits page 20. The tensions are high, and everyone&rsquo;s got a motive. Pinchback makes a great detective, as he can code himself on either side of the racial tensions surrounding the murder. I can&rsquo;t tell you how the book will play out, obviously, but <em>Renaissance</em>&rsquo;s first issue is a compelling beginning, and Berger&rsquo;s imprimatur should earn a reader&rsquo;s trust that the story will keep the promise made by the opening chapter.</p>
