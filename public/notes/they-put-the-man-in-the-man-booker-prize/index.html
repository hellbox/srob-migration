<p>I was so excited to <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/15/man-booker-prize-shortlist-announced/">report the Man Booker Shortlist names</a> (and the attendant Seattle connection) yesterday that I completely failed to <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/27/talking-with-nicola-griffith-about-the-importance-of-counting-womens-stories/">follow the advice of Seattle author Nicola Griffith</a>: I didn&rsquo;t count the number of women&rsquo;s voices on the list. Luckily, <a href="http://nicolagriffith.com/2015/09/16/man-booker-2015-shortlist-is-appalling/">Griffith <em>did</em> do a gender count</a>, and she finds the results to be &ldquo;appalling.&rdquo; There are fewer women on the shortlist than usual, she says, and very few of the books are about the experiences of women.</p>

<blockquote>This year, 2 of the 6 shortlisted books are written by women. Between them they wrote 6 protagonists, 5 of which are men.2 One male author writes about 1 woman (though he also writes about 3 men). So this year, of the 15.4% of protagonists who are female, a pitiful 7.7% are women written by women.</blockquote>

<p>I <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/27/talking-with-nicola-griffith-about-the-importance-of-counting-womens-stories/">interviewed Griffith on this subject</a> a couple months ago, and it seems that I&rsquo;ve already forgotten the lessons of that interview. I should have known better, and I should&rsquo;ve done better in my post yesterday. If we want publishing to become more inclusive, we need to submit every literary prize to this kind of scrutiny.</p>
