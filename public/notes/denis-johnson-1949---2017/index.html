<p>Writer Chris Offutt reports on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, it&#39;s true.  Denis Johnson died yesterday morning.  He was at home, peaceful.</p>&mdash; Chris Offutt (@Chris_Offutt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Offutt/status/867971243089084418">May 26, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Based on the high number of mourning authors on my Twitter feed right now, it&rsquo;s fair to characterize Johnson as a writer&rsquo;s writer — one of the greats, a talent so advanced that it mystifies peers.</p>

<p><em>Jesus&rsquo; Son</em> has to be one of the best short story collections of the 20th century, and <em>The Name of the World</em> is a magnificent short novel about grief and loss and people-shaped holes in lives. As news of Johnson&rsquo;s passing spreads, I expect many people to be pulling <em>The Name of the World</em> off their bookshelves tonight.</p>
