<p>For <em>Interview</em> magazine, <a href="http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/ursula-k-le-guin#_">Choire Sicha interviewed Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, and it&rsquo;s exactly as delightful as you hope it would be. They discuss editing, the book business, fans, and her big problem with poets. (&ldquo;Poets get very territorial, and that&rsquo;s too bad; that&rsquo;s a waste of time.&rdquo;)</p>
