At 2 pm, Bainbridge Island author Jonathan Evison, author of novels like [*This Is Your Life, Harriet Chance!*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/heaven-is-a-place-on-earth/) and the excellent [*The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving*](https://medium.com/@paulconstant/bringing-the-hurt-ae10a2311d55#.yhs1anyzw) will be doing an Ask Me Anything on Reddit. [Follow this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3v65p1/hi_im_jonathan_evison_author_of_this_is_your_life/) and, well, ask Evison anything. In my experience, he's always been [remarkably open](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/how-much-do-novelists-make/Content?oid=15445088) in interviews, from the business side of things to what he thinks of other writers. I can pretty much guarantee he'll be painfully honest, which makes this an interesting opportunity for those burning questions you've always wanted to drop on a novelist.
