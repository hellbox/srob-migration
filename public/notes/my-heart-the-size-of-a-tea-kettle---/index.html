<p>What I brew in me<br>
your tongue no longer tastes.</p>

<p>Do you believe passion<br>
or security</p>

<p>ruins the palette?<br>
We once boiled red</p>

<p>like the most glorious<br>
emergency</p>

<p>and at the worst times.<br>
Sip me</p>

<p>before I’m lukewarm,<br>
before the whistle of regret</p>

<p>keeps us awake.<br>
Dear love, last night</p>

<p>I walked in the rain<br>
dressed only in a bathrobe. I bought</p>

<p>a little kettle on sale<br>
and am convinced our lives</p>

<p>will be better now.<br>
I am not sad</p>

<p>when I say this. I am not quite<br>
unsad either.</p>

<p>If there is one thing to be said<br>
about marriage or monogamy</p>

<p>there is another thing entirely<br>
to be undone. Clean or dirty</p>

<p>is how I divide the day.<br>
After you leave</p>

<p>or before you come home.<br>
The more I smell</p>

<p>of cleaning products<br>
the messier it means I am.</p>

<p>The toilet, the kitchen sink,<br>
every closet–this house</p>

<p>is yours to pollute.<br>
I’ve been alone</p>

<p>in it<br>
for many, many hours.</p>

<p>Look around.<br>
There’s no trace of me.</p>

<p>It’s as if<br>
I don’t even exist.</p>
