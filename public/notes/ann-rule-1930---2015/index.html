<p>KING 5 <a href="http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/seattle/2015/07/27/seattle-true-crime-writer-ann-rule-dies/30744985/">is reporting</a> that local true crime writer Ann Rule has died. If you&rsquo;ve never read <em>The Stranger Beside Me</em>, about Rule&rsquo;s personal relationship with serial killer Ted Bundy, you really should. It&rsquo;s far and away her best book, and a classic of the true crime genre.</p>

<p>I wrote a snarky overview of Rule&rsquo;s writing back when I was the new kid at <em>The Stranger</em>, and while I regret the tone of the piece — I was so much younger then! — I do not regret my opinion of Rule&rsquo;s work. Her writing was often a little florid, but she was an impeccable journalist, an expert interviewer, and a terrific researcher. She deserved better from me than the piece I delivered, and I&rsquo;m not going to link to it here.</p>

<p>Rule demonstrated exactly how reporters should cover crime: with facts, with hundreds of pages of research backing you up, and with a ton of compassion for the victims and survivors of the crime. She never sold a victim out in exchange for a great story. She always listened to survivors, and gave them time and space to tell their stories. There aren&rsquo;t enough reporters like her left anymore. It&rsquo;s so sad that Rule&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/21/ann-rule-sons-theft_n_7111854.html">last days were so difficult</a>. She deserved better from the world after such a singular career and such an impressive body of work.</p>
