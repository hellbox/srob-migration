<p class="noindent">Our sponsor, Friends' of the UW Libraries, gala event "Literary Voices", on May 3rd, is one of those amazing, inspiring events that are too far and too few between on our literary calendars. This year, they've got a keynote address by the inimitable Annie Proulx, author of _The Shipping News_, _Barkskins_, and the short story "Brokeback Mountain". </p>

The event is a fundraiser that pays directly for student employee scholarships. You are either helping to create the librarians of tomorrow, or get the librarians of today the support they need to run one of the most robust, impressive University library systems on the West Coast. <a href="http://events.uw.edu/events/literary-voices/event-summary-307553ee6d7c4f30b873748baef64f51.aspx" title="Literary Voices - Event Summary | Online Registration by Cvent">Tickets are easy to get, both for individual tickets, and for buying a table to invite all your friends</a>.
