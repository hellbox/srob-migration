<p>GoodReads just <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/545-how-the-girl-on-the-train-became-a-runaway-success">put up a blog post</a> about the stunning success of Paula Hawkins&rsquo;s thriller <em>The Girl on the Train</em>. If you&rsquo;re into metrics, this will fascinate you. If you&rsquo;re a big believer in the power of reviews — as I am — it will affirm your worldview in a satisfying way. And that&rsquo;s what the internet is all about, right? Affirming your worldview in a satisfying way?</p>

<p>Also satisfying: the post&rsquo;s comment section, which is mostly full of people who, like me, thought <em>The Girl on the Train</em> was an unremarkable thriller.</p>
