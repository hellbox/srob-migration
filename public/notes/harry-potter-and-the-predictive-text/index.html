<p>&ldquo;The castle grounds snarled with a wave of magically magnified wind,&rdquo; the Harry Potter book begins. It continues,</p>

<blockquote>The sky outside was a great black ceiling, which was full of blood. The only sounds drifting from Hagrid’s hut were the disdainful shrieks of his own furniture. Magic: it was something that Harry Potter thought was very good.</blockquote>

<p>This is the opening passage of <a href="http://botnik.org/content/harry-potter.html"><em>Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash</em></a>, an artificial intelligence-created text generated out of the Harry Potter novels. The excerpt was created by Botnik, &ldquo;a community of writers, artists and developers collaborating with machines to create strange new things.&rdquo; One of the Botkin brain trust is Bob Mankoff, who until recently was the cartoon editor at the <em>New Yorker</em>.</p>

<p>Like all predictive text strings, the excerpt sounds relatively human at first. The first sentence is inartful, but it makes sense. The second sentence loses a little bit of its way, though the idea of the sky as a black ceiling full of blood seems entirely acceptable in fantasy fiction. It&rsquo;s when you get to the shrieking furniture that the wheels start to come off. That last sentence, though, is so tone-deaf that it&rsquo;s actually hilarious.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that one day AI will successfully write fiction. Newspapers already employ robots to write simple sports and business stories. I&rsquo;m not saying that these AI-produced romance or sci-fi novels will be especially good, but that&rsquo;s not the point. All they need is to make sense. If a computer can slap together a thousand romance novels in a minute, and then if an algorithm can sell a hundred copies of each of the books to readers for three or four bucks a piece, you&rsquo;re dealing with a kind of volume — in production and distribution — that the publishing industry has never even imagined.</p>
