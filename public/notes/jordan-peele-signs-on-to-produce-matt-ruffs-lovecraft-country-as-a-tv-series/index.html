<p>Seattle novelist Matt Ruff&rsquo;s excellent novel <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/18/talking-with-matt-ruff-about-science-fictions-racist-past/"><em>Lovecraft Country</em></a> started its life as a pitch for a television show. Now, <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hbo-orders-jordan-peelea-drama-lovecraft-country-bad-robot-1004446?utm_source=twitter">the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> says the cycle is complete</a>, as <em>Lovecraft Country</em> (the novel) is heading to HBO. And <em>Get Out</em> director Jordan Peele is producing it, along with J.J. Abrams&rsquo; Bad Robot production company:</p>

<blockquote>The drama — described as an anthological horror series that reclaims genre storytelling from the African-American perspective — hails from Peele's Monkeypaw Productions, as well as Bad Robot and Warner Bros. Television. Peele and Green will executive produce alongside Bad Robot's J.J Abrams and Ben Stephenson.</blockquote>

<p>Congratulations to Matt Ruff! This is terrific news. The series has been greenlit straight to series, so we hope to see it at some point in the near future.</p>
