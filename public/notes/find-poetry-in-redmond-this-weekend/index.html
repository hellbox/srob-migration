<p>There are poetry events all over Seattle for National Poetry Month, but on Sunday April 17th, there&rsquo;s a great reason to take a trip out to Redmond. It&rsquo;s called Open Studio, and it features a bunch of great people:</p>

<blockquote>Celebrate National Poetry Month through song, contemporary forays into poetic performance and collaborations between sound artists and writers in this event. Curated by Redmond Poet Laureate Shin Yu Pai.</blockquote>

<p>And here are the performers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jessika Kenney, vocalist/composer, accompanied by Behruz Alavi on Persian ney</li>
<li>Sierra Nelson &amp; Rachel Kessler (aka Vis-à-Vis Society), performance artists</li>
<li>Alan Chong Lau and Susie Kozawa, poet/visual artist and sound artist/composer</li>
<li>Srivani Jade (Srivani Jade Music), singer</li>
<li>Levi Fuller (Levi Fuller &amp; the Library), musician/producer</li>
<li>Michael Dylan Welch, poet</li>
</ul>

<p>We&rsquo;re big fans of Pai, the Vis-à-Vis Society, and Fuller in particular. This would make for a great Poetry Month pilgrimage.</p>
