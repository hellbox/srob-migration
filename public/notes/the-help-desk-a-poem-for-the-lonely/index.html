<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Will you please write me a poem?**</p>

<p class="noindent">**Signed,**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Lonely,</p>
 

<p class="noindent">Have you considered investing in a companion? You could test the waters with a worm farm or jump whole hog into something more leggy, like a dachshund. I do not recommend spiders for beginners. They demand a taxing amount of eye contact.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t write poetry unless it&rsquo;s in threat form. (I read on a bathroom stall that law enforcement have a difficult time distinguishing credible threats from art if they rhyme.) But my mother once wrote a lovely poem about friendship that may speak to your heart:</p>

<blockquote>I have my puppy sitting here<br>
Very close, I love him dear<br>
Too bad that he's been dead a year.<br>
He's kind of cold and stiff to touch<br>
He's cheap to feed – he don't eat much.<br>
I have to go, no time to talk<br>
It's time to drag him for his walk.</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
