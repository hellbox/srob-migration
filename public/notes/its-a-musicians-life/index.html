<p>Eugene M. Babb spent a life in gigs, and then wrote about it. His book <em>Grit and Roses</em>, published by <a href="http://thirdplacepress.com" title="Third Place Press | Home | Print on demand and self publishing services">Third Place Press</a> (yes! <a href="http://www.thirdplacebooks.com" title="Third Place Books | Books, community, events and more">Third Place books</a> has a press! They print books on their Espresso Book Machine, Ginger), covers his thirty years of life as a working musician.</p>

<p>We have two expcerpts from this short, sharply told book <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">on our sponsors page</a>. How wonderful to have a local author, published by a local press, as a sponsor this week. We loved the work, and thin, you will too.</p>

<p>And thanks to Babb and Third Place Press, we&rsquo;re able to bring you the content we do every day. Sponsors like them help us in our campaign to make internet advertising <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Help us make internet advertisements 100 percent less terrible">100 percent less terrible</a>. All we ask is that you take a read.</p>
