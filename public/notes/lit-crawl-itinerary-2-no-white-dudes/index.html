<p class="intro">This Thursday night is Lit Crawl, a bacchanalia of literary events spread over four courses across Capitol Hill, First Hill, and downtown. [You can find the full schedule here](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2017-schedule), but we wanted to provide a few possible itineraries for people who have a hard time making up their minds. Come back tomorrow for the next itnerary. [Here's our first Itinerary from yesterday](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/10/16/lit-crawl-itinerary-1-the-genre-walk/).</p>

<p>Tonight&rsquo;s Lit Crawl path is perfect for when you&rsquo;re sick of hearing white guys talk. (And really, in 2017, who <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> fucking sick of hearing white guys talk?)</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1</strong>: Start out at Hugo House for the Seattle Urban Book Expo showcase. Local authors Kristin Alana, Kamari Bright, Natasha Rivers, and JL Cheatham II will present work that you may have seen at the increasingly popular literary event.</p>
