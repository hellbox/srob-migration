<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday, April 9: *Make Trouble* Reading **</h5></p>
Cecile Richards is president of both the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Her book *Make Trouble* is about her life - protesting the Vietnam War as a child, growing up as the daughter of fabulous Texas governor Ann Richards, and fighting regressive anti-woman forces in her role at Planned Parenthood. Tonight, she'll be in conversation with Lindy West, who is having a big week — West is also interviewing author Samantha Irby at University Temple on Wednesday, April 11th, and she's headlining at Benaroya Hall on Sunday, an event that is our sponsorship this week.

Seattle-area painter, sculptor, and passionate feminist rights activist Jasmine Gervais examines ideas of sexuality and society in her work. Among other works she&rsquo;s created, she has made these funny and oddly touching tableaus of people in the midst of what appear to be half-clothed, drunken hookups. The advertising copy for this event invites you to come see and discuss her work in &ldquo;an anti-gravity, gloriously inclusive environment.&rdquo;
