Chaim Gartenberg [at The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/19/13680564/recomendmeabook-book-recommendation-website-first-page) writes about the really neat idea behind [Recommendmeabook.com](http://www.recommendmeabook.com/):

<blockquote>Designed by developer Givi Phirtskhalava, the site presents you with the first page of a novel as a blank, standalone item without title, author, or cover, allowing you to experience the beginning of a book without coloring it with any preconceived ideas.</blockquote>

You just read the first page and if you like it, you push a button to reveal the title and author. If you don't like it, you hit the "Next Book" button. Simple. Unfortunately, the site only provides links to Amazon to buy the books, but you know to buy the books from your local independent bookstores instead, right? Right. [Go browse for a while](http://www.recommendmeabook.com/).
