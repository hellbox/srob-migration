<li><p>Lit Crawl Seattle <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LitCrawlSeattle/posts/1130578770309500">announced the date</a> for this year&rsquo;s crawl: <strong>October 27, 2016</strong>. Save the date. (And if you didn&rsquo;t attend last year&rsquo;s Lit Crawl, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/23/started-from-the-bottom-now-were-here/">here&rsquo;s our roundup</a> to give you an idea of what you missed.)</p></li>

<li><p>The MFA in Creative Writing program at Whidbey Island&rsquo;s Northwest Institute of Literary Arts is in serious financial trouble. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bonny.becker.77/posts/10153572401133937">Here&rsquo;s a letter from a student outlining the problem</a> — &ldquo;We are devastated to learn that, in the middle of our semester, we have no idea if we will continue,&rdquo; she writes — and <a href="http://www.nila.edu/www/donate-to-nila/">here&rsquo;s where you can donate to help</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Amazon has announced that they&rsquo;re opening a second Amazon Books physical location, <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-to-open-second-brick-and-mortar-bookstore-in-san-diego-2016-03-07?mod=MethodeStories">this time in San Diego</a>. In case you haven&rsquo;t read my review of the first Amazon Books, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/09/the-algorithm-method/">here&rsquo;s a taste of what San Diego is in for</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>This is something that anti-e-book commentators have been warning for years, and it <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/04/barnes_and_noble_pulls_out_of_blighty/?mt=1457362930924">appears to be coming true in Great Britain</a>. Barnes &amp; Noble&rsquo;s Nook e-book business is shutting down over there, and Nook users just received a warning that they&rsquo;re working &ldquo;to ensure that you have <strong>continued access to the vast majority of your purchased NOOK Books</strong> at no new cost to you.&rdquo; Note that &ldquo;vast majority,&rdquo; there. When you &ldquo;buy&rdquo; an e-book, you&rsquo;re really just licensing it; it&rsquo;s not like buying a physical book, it&rsquo;s like purchasing software. If the deal changes — if an e-book supplier goes under, for instance — you might not have access to your books anymore. Sounds like some British e-book buyers are about to learn that the hard way.</p></li>

<li><p>Harper Lee&rsquo;s will has <a href="http://www.mhpbooks.com/harper-lees-will-is-now-as-mysterious-as-her-second-novel/">been sealed</a>. Someone is going to write an amazing biography of Harper Lee at some point, and they&rsquo;re going to report on what really happened in the last years of her life. I hope that book comes out before I die.</p></li>

<li><p>Brandon Hicks&rsquo;s <a href="http://therumpus.net/2016/03/145833/">&ldquo;Profiles of Cartoonists&rdquo; at The Rumpus</a> is a very funny, if unfortunately typo-ridden, overview of the sad state of professional cartooning today.</p></li>
