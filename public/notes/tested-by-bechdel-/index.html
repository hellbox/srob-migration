<p>As we have noted repeatedly, this Thursday is Lit Crawl Seattle. But it&rsquo;s also important to note that Alison Bechdel <a href="https://townhallseattle.org/event/an-evening-with-alison-bechdel/">will be reading at Town Hall in a sold-out edition</a> of the 2015-2016 Seattle Arts and Lectures reading series. If you haven&rsquo;t yet read Bechdel&rsquo;s <em>Fun Home</em> or <em>Dykes to Watch Out For</em>, <a href="http://lithub.com/myself-in-translation-on-the-genius-of-alison-bechdel/">this excellent essay by Seattle writer Corinne Manning at Literary Hub</a> explains her particular genius.</p>
