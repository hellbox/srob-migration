<li><p>Have you also read about the time Prince <a href="http://wfpl.org/prince-once-gave-louisville-western-library-12000/">donated $12,000 to a library in Louisville</a> because it &ldquo;was the first full-service free public library in the nation open to African-Americans?&rdquo; If not, <a href="http://wfpl.org/prince-once-gave-louisville-western-library-12000/">please do so</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Beloved Vertigo Comics editor Shelly Bond was fired by DC Comics this week. <a href="http://www.theouthousers.com/index.php/news/135141-dc-restructures-vertigo-fires-shelly-bond-provokes-naming-of-open-secret-sexual-harasser-in-upper-management.html">Jude Terror at The Outhousers</a> connects this news to the longstanding gossip that one editor at DC Comics has such a terrible record of sexual harassment charges that he&rsquo;s been moved into what comics journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/Nick_Hanover/status/722966423505498112">Nick Hanover described</a> as &ldquo;an all male quarantine.&rdquo; Comics rumor site <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/04/21/sexual-harassment-allegations-against-superman-editor-eddie-berganza-revived/">Bleeding Cool identified the DC staffer in question</a> as Superman editor Eddie Berganza</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;On the one hand the percentage of adults, overall, who say they haven’t read a book in the last year has climbed noticeably since 1978. On the other hand, the youngest demographic surveyed, ages 16-17, were <a href="http://thefutureofpublishing.com/2016/04/netflix-ceo-describes-publishings-dilemma/">the most likely to have read a book in the past 12 months</a>.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Libby Coleman <a href="http://www.ozy.com/performance/the-slam-poetry-that-could-be-front-page-news/67257">profiles new World Slam Poetry champion Emi Mahmoud at OZY</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Her poetry shifts the focus back on Darfur. What sets Mahmoud apart, according to Renee, is a “global lens. Slam can be very U.S.-centric.” Mahmoud tries to start conversations. Some of her talking points are anecdotal — she has returned to Sudan a number of times, the longest visit for six months — and some of her stories have been drawn from refugee family members. Still other insights stem from her academic work: She’s double majoring in anthropology and molecular biology and is currently studying the trauma experienced by Darfuri refugee women in the diaspora. Her hope is to combine raising awareness through performance with a concrete plan to rebuild infrastructure in Darfur.</blockquote>
