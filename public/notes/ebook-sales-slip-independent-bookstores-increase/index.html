<p>Alexandra Alter <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/business/media/the-plot-twist-e-book-sales-slip-and-print-is-far-from-dead.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share&amp;_r=0">at the <em>New York Times</em> reports</a> that e-book sales have slipped for the first time in recent memory.</p>

<blockquote>Now, there are signs that some e-book adopters are returning to print, or becoming hybrid readers, who juggle devices and paper. E-book sales fell by 10 percent in the first five months of this year, according to the Association of American Publishers, which collects data from nearly 1,200 publishers. Digital books accounted last year for around 20 percent of the market, roughly the same as they did a few years ago.</blockquote>

<p>In addition, we&rsquo;ve got more indepedent bookstores in America than we did in 2010: &ldquo;The American Booksellers Association counted <strong>1,712 member stores in 2,227</strong> locations in 2015, up from 1,410 in 1,660 locations five years ago.&rdquo; In other words, e-books are here to stay, but so are print books. This is good news for everybody: we want more readers in the world, not less. And we want to get those books in front of readers in every way possible — in e-book format, in print, in audio. Books aren&rsquo;t going anywhere.</p>
