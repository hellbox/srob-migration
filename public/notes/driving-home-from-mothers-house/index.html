<p>As I drive through the bower<br>
of old oak trees<br>
scanning 68th and 20th avenues northeast <br>
I am scared by the moon.<br>
It is so low in the sky this night<br>
I think it will smack me in the face.<br>
I try to turn the wipers on,<br>
but strands of hair white as paste<br>
cover the window like thick rain.<br>
A woman&rsquo;s mouth stretches open<br>
in a silent scream. Bent fingers claw<br>
until they reach my chest.<br>
Some nights I lose my way home.</p>
