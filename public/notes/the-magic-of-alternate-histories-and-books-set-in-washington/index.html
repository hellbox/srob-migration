<p>Our sponsor <a href="https://heyjoule.wordpress.com">Julie Manthey</a> was camping at Cape Disappointment when she came up with the idea for her first novel, <em>The Magic of Cape Disappointment</em>. The history of Lewis &amp; Clark permeats the Columbia River outlet, and there are so many things unknown in the accounts of their history.</p>

<p>One fictional spark: what if Meriwether Lewis had children? What would happen if one his descendents, Kay, returned home to care for family, and discovered strange coincidences, unique characters, and, of course, a man that bears a resemblence to a mysterious character Kay had been painting?
