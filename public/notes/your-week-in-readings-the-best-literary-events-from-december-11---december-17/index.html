<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday, December 12:  Navigating Seattle Transit without Losing Your Mind**</h5></p>
Town Hall teams up with the Seattle Department of Transportation and TransitCenter to discuss why our traffic is so fucked and how you can help yourself slightly un-fuck the traffic. Hopefully, they’ll also discuss ways to leave your car and get more transit to your neck of the woods in a shorter timeframe, because that’s the only way we’re really going to make a difference around here.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday, December 15: Four Seattle Poets**</h5></p>
The last author reading at Elliott Bay Book Company for the year of 2017 is a stellar lineup of debut poets. You definitely know Jane Wong, whose *Overpour* was the first big debut of the year. And frequent readers of the site also know EJ Koh, whose *A Lesser Love* is a genius collection that spans love and war. Mita Mahato is a paper-cut cartoonist whose first collection, *In Between*, is a milestone in the small-but-growing field of poetry comics. You might not know Montreux Rotholtz or her debut collection, *Unmark*, and that’s okay. Every great reading has some element of discovery to it, doesn’t it?
