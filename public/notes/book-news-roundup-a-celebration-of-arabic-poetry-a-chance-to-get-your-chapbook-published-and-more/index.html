<li><p>Two Sylvias Press&rsquo;s <a href="http://twosylviaspress.com/chapbook-prize.html">annual chapbook contest is now open for submissions</a>. The reading fee is $15, but the payoff is pretty great: the winner gets $400 and 20 copies of their finished chapbook. A poem by the winner of 2014&rsquo;s chapbook contest, Cecilia Woloch, was <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/05/two-sylvias-press-poet-cecilia-woloch-in-the-new-york-times/">recently featured in the <em>New York Times Magazine</em></a>.</p></li>

<li><p>We&rsquo;ve already suggested <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/15/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-february-15th-21st/">two great events</a> for tonight, but we just learned about this event happening in the Husky Union Building on the UW campus tonight, and we wanted you to know about it: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1969176933307912/">an evening of Arabic Poetry and Music</a>, featuring poetry read in English and in Arabic by students. Some Seattle-area publications want you to think that Seattle isn&rsquo;t an international city of literature; that&rsquo;s just not true. This reading is just one great example of how Seattle&rsquo;s literary scene represents the whole world on a regular basis.</p></li>

Clowes writes, &ldquo;he was inexplicable, the most singular human being I&rsquo;ve ever met. There&rsquo;s nobody else in the world even remotely like him.&rdquo;</p></li>
