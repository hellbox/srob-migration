<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen the 1973 Hal Ashby film <em>The Last Detail</em>, I&rsquo;d urge you to do so. <em>Detail</em>, starring Jack Nicholson, Otis Young, and Randy Quaid as young Navy men on a road trip before one of them is put in the brig for a long time, is one of the most quintessentially American films I think I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It&rsquo;s an ambitious, dark, funny film that name-checks <em>Billy Budd</em> and questions our assumptions about freedom and duty.</p>

<p>Richard Linklater&rsquo;s new film <em>Last Flag Flying</em> is a spiritual sequel to <em>Detail</em>, but it&rsquo;s not a direct sequel. Both films are based on novels written by Bainbridge Island author Darryl Ponicsan (Ponicsan co-authored the screenplay for <em>Flag</em> with Linklater,) and both feature three military men on a road trip. But the men in <em>Flag</em> are Marines, not Navy; the names of the characters are different; and the timelines of the films don&rsquo;t quite line up evenly. Still, <em>Flag</em> picks up the spiritual threads of <em>Detail</em> and spins them out into a story that&rsquo;s a little wiser, a little slower, and a little bit more disillusioned than the 1973 film.</p>

<p>Steve Carell&rsquo;s Larry Shepherd is the Quaid character, the younger innocent who sets the plot in motion. Laurence Fishburne plays Richard Mueller, a former hellraiser who has turned to Jesus and now lives as a reverend. And Bryan Cranston absolutely slays as Sal Nealon, the rabble-rousing smartass who nevertheless misses the time he spent in the Marines. (One relatively unknown actor, J. Quinton Johnson, plays a supporting role as a young Marine assigned to the three older men; Johnson more than carries his weight with these great actors, here. I expect to see more great things from him in the very near future.)</p>

<p>Cranston is playing the Nicholson role here, and it&rsquo;s a knockout performance. He&rsquo;s a huge dick — an alcoholic asshole who loudly tells you how horrible he is and then immediately demonstrates that he was telling the truth all along — but there&rsquo;s something so lovable about his bombast that you can&rsquo;t ever quite turn your back on him. Cranston builds on Nicholson&rsquo;s performance in <em>Detail</em> by making his character a stand-in for American weariness. He notes that America doesn&rsquo;t build anything anymore. He has disparaging words for the Iraq War — the film is set in 2003 — and he laments a simpler time when men were men. His nostalgia is wrong-headed, but his sadness is real and raw and very relatable.</p>

<p><em>Flag</em> is a very talky, slow-paced film. It doesn&rsquo;t have the cathartic youthful vigor of <em>Detail</em>. These are three older men who&rsquo;ve been beaten down by life and duty and the death of their dreams, and anyone expecting a wild dance party that fixes everything is likely in the wrong theater. But if you have a taste for slow and talky films, you might not find a better one this year. The writing and pacing of <em>Flag</em> is exquisite, and the questions it raises about belief and friendship and honor are piercing.</p>

<p>And while <em>Flag</em> will inevitably be compared with <em>Detail</em>, there&rsquo;s another film in theaters right now that deserves mention, too. Greta Gerwig&rsquo;s directorial debut, <em>Lady Bird</em>, is also set (partially) in 2003, and <em>Lady Bird</em> and <em>Flag</em> would make for a stellar weekend double-feature. Both films wrestle with the American response to <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> and the beginning of the end of our imperial authority as a nation. Both films capture a moment before technology consumed every waking moment of our attention. And both films depict very different moments in the ongoing conversation between individual and society.</p>

<p>Nearly 15 years later, we&rsquo;re just starting to realize what it is we lost as a nation, and how we lost it. Small, funny, brilliant films like <em>Lady Bird</em> and <em>Last Flag Flying</em> are a big part of how we&rsquo;ll finally be able to understand what happened to us.</p>
