<p class="intro">On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our fourth suggested itinerary:</p>

<p>Look: sometimes you don&rsquo;t want to go to a reading just to hear some moron white guy complain about being a white guy. I get it. Everyone gets it. God, they just won&rsquo;t shut up! Here&rsquo;s an itinerary that does not include a single white male.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong>. The Frye Art Museum is hosting an evening of Native writers reading poetry and prose. Here&rsquo;s the lineup:</p>

<blockquote>Laura Da’ (Eastern Shawnee), Sasha LaPointe (Nooksack), Casandra Lopez (Chicana, Cahuilla, Luiseño, Tongva), and Sara Marie Ortiz (Pueblo of Acoma). Elissa Washuta (Cowlitz) hosts.</blockquote>

<p><strong>2</strong>. Women&rsquo;s writing colony Hedgebrook hosts the second event of the night at Sole Repair. Allison Green, Frances McCue, Felicia Gonzalez, and Anne Liu Kellor read new work, most of which was probably written at Hedgebrook on Whidbey.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>. <a href="http://www.vidaweb.org/tag/diversity/">VIDA</a> closes out your evening at Fred Widlife Refuge, with women of color reading new prose. Readers include Shannon Barber, Jennine Capo Crucet, and  Wendy C. Ortiz.</p>
