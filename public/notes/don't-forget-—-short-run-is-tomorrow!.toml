Tomorrow, the Short Run Comix & Arts Festival will be happening [at the Fisher Pavillion at Seattle Center from 11 am to 6 pm](http://www.shortrun.org/). If you're looking for a ridiculously long list of all the exhibitors at the show, [you can find that here](http://www.shortrun.org/exhibitors/). But the best way to go to Short Run is to **not have a plan**. Bring some cash and walk around. If you see something you like, buy it. I know it's super-scary, but try talking to strangers.

If you do insist on making plans beforehand, you might be interested in the short interviews we've been running with Short Run exhibitors all week long. Here they are in one handy list:

* [Casandra Lopez of *As/Us* magazine](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/07/meet-the-short-run-vendors-casandra-lopez-of-asus/) will be presenting some new work, as well as back issues of her wonderful magazine.
* Check out [Josh Simmons's horror comics](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/14/meet-josh-simmons-at-short-run-bring-xanax/).
* The art collective Fictilis will be [running a Short Run Census Bureau](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/21/fictilis-wants-to-help-launch-conversations-at-short-run/) that might be very helpful for first-time visitors to the festival.
* Krish Raghav is the [first Dash grant winner](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/28/meet-short-runs-first-dash-grant-winner-krish-raghav/) in Short Run history. This is his first-ever show, and he's debuting a new comic travelogue of Mexico.

But this is just a tiny portion of the dozens of exhibitors who will be at this festival. You owe it to yourself to show up and wander around and see what you can find. I'll be walking the floor tomorrow, trying to track down the next big local comics phenomenon. I hope to see you out there.
