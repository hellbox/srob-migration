<p>Matthew Simmons, the local author and publisher of Instant Future, an e-novella imprint of Future Tense Press, has figured out a way to re-enact an American short story classic in <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How to play Cheever&#39;s The Swimmer in GTA V: Take Michael to Vinewood Hills, get him a star &amp; have him escape by running from pool to pool.</p>&mdash; Matthew Simmons (@matthewjsimmons) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewjsimmons/status/628974551313989632">August 5, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>If those tweets put you in the mood to read &ldquo;The Swimmer,&rdquo; it looks like <a href="http://www.loa.org/images/pdf/Cheever_Swimmer.pdf">Library of America has made it available to read as a PDF</a>. I hope someone figures out how to adapt Updike&rsquo;s &ldquo;A&amp;P&rdquo; in <em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em> next.</p>
