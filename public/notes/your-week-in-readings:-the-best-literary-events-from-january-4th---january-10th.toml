<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday January 4th: Reading Through It: A Post-Election Book Club**</h5></p> 
See our Event of the Week column for details. *Third Place Books Seward Park, 5041 Wilson Ave S, 474-2200, http://thirdplacebooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *
 
 <p class="noindent"><h5>**Alternate Wednesday January 4th: Contagious Exchanges**</h5></p> 
 If you’re not attending a book club with *the Seattle Review of Books* and the *Seattle Weekly*, you should be at Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore’s queer literary salon series, which this month features two of the funniest writers in Seattle: poet/essayist Sarah Galvin and essayist/monologuist David Schmader. 
*Hugo House, 1021 Columbia St., 322-7030, http://hugohouse.org. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday January 5th: *The Expense of a View* Reading
**</h5></p> 
Polly Buckingham has long been a literary force out of eastern Washington — she helped found StringTown Press and she edits at Willow Springs Books. Tonight, she reads from her new story collection with the help of another eastern Washington gem — Spokane poet Nance Van Winckel, whose most recent collection is a “poetically altered encyclopedia,” which sounds fascinating. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m.* 
 
<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday January 6th: *This Glittering Republic* Reading**</h5></p> 
Seattle poet Quenton Baker hit it big late last year when he debuted his first collection, *This Glittering Republic*. His poems look at history and race and intergenerational burdens with a fresh eye. Baker is funny and brilliant and just about the closest thing to a voice of reason you can find in America, 2017. 
*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m.* 

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1483421508838/endofmycareer.jpg)</p>
<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday January 7th: *The End of My Career* Reading**</h5></p> 
Seattle author Corinne Manning, who just stepped down from her leadership role as founder of the *James Franco Review*, will appear in conversation with memoirist Martha Glover, whose new book is about investigating workers’ comps claims for the state. The world of work is a troubling, complicated one, and Glover provides a unique perspective. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m.* 

<h5>**Sunday January 8th: Stories from the *Saturday Evening Post* **</h5></p> 
It seems likely that this year will bring with it even more magazine closures, and that’s a goddamn shame. This reading of popular *Saturday Evening Post* pieces — in which local performers read work by P.G. Wodehouse, Robert Heinlein, and Shirley Jackson —  ought to demonstrate what magazines, at their very best, are capable of promoting.
 *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $10-13. All ages. 2 p.m.* 

<h5>**Monday January 9th: *The Secret Life of Fat* Reading**</h5></p> 
Sylvia Tara is a biochemist, and she’s about to give you a terrific reason to quit your New Year’s resolution before it even begins. *The Secret Life of Fat* examines the complicated role that fat plays in our lives: we hate it, even though it’s necessary to survive and it’s trying to protect us. *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday January 10th: Salon of Shame**</h5></p>
We’ve all got some residual shame in us after the godawful mess that was last year. That’s what makes the Salon of Shame so important: it’s like a ritual burning of shame, in which normal Seattleites gather to read their most embarrassing teenage writings. Come — be embarrassed, and then be free. *Theatre Off Jackson, 409 7th Ave, http://brownpapertickets.com . $15. All ages. 8 p.m. *
