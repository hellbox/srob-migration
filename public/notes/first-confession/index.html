<p>The color in the room was yellow.<br>
I don’t know if I knew then why,<br>
or that yellow is as much the color of nerves<br>
as it is of cowardice, as I stood stiff-straight<br>
in front of Father Panda and examined his face.<br>
It was wide, porous, ruddy, full as a moon beneath<br>
a wave of curly hair the color of the pews. <br>
We both wore white, he in his vestments,<br>
me in my dress, all decked out<br>
with the things I knew I must have done wrong.<br>
From the vestibule, the smell of incense wafted in.<br>
Outside the room I could hear the sound of children<br>
trying hard to be quiet. A bit of holy water<br>
splashed from someone’s finger to his forehead.<br>
I was bad. I was definitely bad. I thought. The bell<br>
tolled. Father Panda’s wide face split into a smile.<br>
I amused him with my silence. I was not a sinner,<br>
after all &mdash; was it possible? No. I gulped, stammered,<br>
dug in: “I can’t think of anything.” That was the sin.</p>
