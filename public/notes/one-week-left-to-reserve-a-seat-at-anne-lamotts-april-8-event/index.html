Sponsor Northwest Associated Arts returns to remind us that <strong>Anne Lamott will be at Benaroya Hall</strong> next week. Don&rsquo;t miss this event; Lamott is beloved by readers and writers, and this city is packed with both — the room will be full of energy, from the stage <em>and</em> from the seats.</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a follower of Lamott&rsquo;s <em>Bird by Bird</em> writing guide or a fan of her thoughtful, direct, and funny novels and essays, you should take the chance to see her in person. She&rsquo;s a sharp, warm, and witty speaker and an iconic presence.
