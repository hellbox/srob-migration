<p>On Snapchat, two reporters for <a href="https://www.axios.com/">brand-new news start-up Axios</a>, Mike Allen and Jim Vandehai, interviewed President-elect Trump about his favorite books. The resulting exchange is reminiscent of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRkWebP2Q0Y">Sarah Palin&rsquo;s most famous interview</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>**...what books are on your nightstand, or what's a book —**</p>

<p>Well, you can see some of them over there. You can see some of them right over here. This is one that I just —</p>

<p>**Which should we read? Should we read it?**</p>

<p>No, I wouldn't say. I mean — [Laughter] It depends on whether you want to read it. This is one. It's very good.</p>

<p>**Is there one you actually like that you'd recommend?**</p>

<p>I like a lot of books. I like reading books. I don't have time to read very much now in terms of the books, but I like reading them. This one is just one that just came out. CNN. The CNN book just came out. I hear it's doing well.</p>

<p>**You're plugging CNN, Mr. President-elect?**</p>

<p>No, I'm not, actually, they just sent me those two books. I just got them. These are two books that are good: this one and this one. That one, you know.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet again, the distance between Trump and President Obama feels like an insurmountable chasm. <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/01/17/sometimes-you-read-fiction-just-because-you-want-to-be-someplace-else/">Obama is a reader and a writer</a>. Donald Trump doesn&rsquo;t seem to read books at all. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-doesnt-read-much-being-president-probably-wouldnt-change-that/2016/07/17/d2ddf2bc-4932-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html?utm_term=.7230bb9a02e8">He famously has said</a> that he doesn&rsquo;t like to read reports or memos if they go over two or three pages. It is time to come to terms with the fact that our incoming president simply doesn&rsquo;t seem to enjoy reading.</p>
