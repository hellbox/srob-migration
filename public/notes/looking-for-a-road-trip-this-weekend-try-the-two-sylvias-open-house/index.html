<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to get out of town for a bit this weekend, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/165451830462479/">consider this</a>: Washington state publisher Two Sylvias Press is having an open house at their new offices in Kingston from 11 am to 5 pm, with wine, food, authors, and books for sale. Two Sylvias, of course, was founded by Kelli Russell Agodon, who was <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/04/argument-waltz-with-pessimistic-drowning/">the very first poet we published here at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em></a>. They&rsquo;ve also published books by <em>SRoB</em> contributors <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/the-seattle-school/">Susan Rich</a> and <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/15/we-walk-a-heart-around-lake-union/">Michelle Pe√±aloza</a>, as well as the estimable <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/authors/esther-altshul-helfgott/">Esther Altshul Helfgott</a>. The offices are a short walk from the Kingston ferry terminal. Seems like a great way to spend a fall afternoon.</p>
