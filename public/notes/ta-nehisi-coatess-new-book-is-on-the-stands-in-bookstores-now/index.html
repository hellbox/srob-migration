<p>Today is the publication date for the new book by Ta-Nehisi Coates, <em>We Were Eight Years in Power</em>. It&rsquo;s a collection of essays which have previously been published in <em>The Atlantic</em>, along with eight new essays that look back on each year of the Obama presidency.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re missing Obama right now, this might be the book for you. And of course, this book is a big deal because it&rsquo;s the first Coates book to be published since <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-seattle-of-your-nightmares/">his breakout sensation <em>Between the World and Me</em></a>. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine another book having the impact of <em>World</em>, but Coates has basically become a household name, and so this is the book everyone is sure to be talking about for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Coates is right now on a promotional tour for the book. Last night, he appeared in <a href="http://art19.com/shows/pod-save-america/episodes/82bb27c0-45ac-4c35-8c54-d41e209d1232">a good (albeit brief) interview on <em>Pod Save America</em></a>, and he&rsquo;s also the subject of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/books/ta-nehisi-coates-we-were-eight-years-in-power.html?_r=0">a very good <em>New York Times</em> profile</a>.</p>
