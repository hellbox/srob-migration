<li><p>Friends, I messed up. I failed to mention in this week&rsquo;s reading calendar that the <a href="http://seattleanarchistbookfair.net/">Seattle Anarchist Book Fair</a> is <strong>tomorrow, August 26th, from 10 am to 5 pm at the Vera Project in Seattle Center</strong>. It features all kinds of neat organizations including Books to Prisoners, Left Bank Books, and the Social Justice Film Festival, and it&rsquo;s absolutely free. <a href="http://seattleanarchistbookfair.net/">Go check it out</a>, please.</p></li>

<li><p>You should definitely read <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/thanks-to-amazon-seattle-is-now-americas-biggest-company-town/">this <em>Seattle Times</em> story</a> about how Seattle is now the country&rsquo;s biggest company town:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>Amazon now occupies a mind-boggling 19 percent of all prime office space in the city, the most for any employer in a major U.S. city, according to a new analysis conducted for *The Seattle Times*.</p>

<p>Amazon’s footprint in Seattle is more than twice as large as any other company in any other big U.S. city, and the e-commerce giant’s expansion here is just getting started.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Here&rsquo;s the thing about company towns: They always flourish until, suddenly, they stop flourishing.</p></li>

<li><p>Seattle publisher Fantagraphics <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/news/jim-broadbent-pens-graphic-novel-fantagraphics-619101">announced this week</a> that they&rsquo;ll be publishing a comic called <em>Dull Margaret</em> written by the great actor Jim Broadbent.</p></li>

<li><p>I don&rsquo;t agree with the assessment that Joan Didion is &ldquo;<a href="https://electricliterature.com/how-ingrid-goes-west-deflates-joan-didion-the-original-millennial-white-girl-6bb50ce0656">the Original Millennial White Girl</a>,&rdquo; but I can tell you that the movie that inspired this observation, <em>Ingrid Goes West</em>, is a decent (if not great) comedy with a bad ending.</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of Didion, there&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Netflix-Announces-Original-Documentaries-Joan-Didion-The-Center-Will-Not-Hold-and-Voyeur-20170823">a Netflix documentary about her coming out later this year</a>, along with a documentary about Gay Talese.</p></li>

<li><p>Neil Gaiman wrote a short-but-touching remembrance of sci-fi author Brian Aldiss <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/22/brian-aldiss-science-fiction-writer-neil-gaiman">at <em>The Guardian</em></a>.</p></li>
