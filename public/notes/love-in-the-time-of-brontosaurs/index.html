<p><p class="noindent">We&rsquo;re immensely grateful to this week&rsquo;s sponsor, Howard Robertson, for sharing an excerpt from his recent novel <em>Love in the Cretaceous</em> â€” which turns everything you learned from <em>Jurassic Park</em> on its head. In Robertson&rsquo;s Oregon, one hundred years from now, dinosaurs roam the earth, while humans are busy cutting off their own exit. Robertson, a notable local poet and fiction writer, throws his readers into the soup with love, loss, and extinction (and a very sinister cameo); the thrills in this one are metaphysical as well as primordial, as you&rsquo;ll see when you dip in.</p>
