<p class="noindent">Sponsor Anne Mendel is here with a full chapter from her comically twisted and dark novel _Etiquette for an Apocalypse_. Set in Portland in 2020, Mendel gives us a future when humanity is falling apart. But is that any reason to set aside manners?</p>

<p><a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">Read the first full chapter on our sponsor&rsquo;s page</a> &mdash; we think you&rsquo;ll really enjoy it. Visit Portland in the near future, and learn all about survival in a high-rise condo during the apocalypse.</p>
