You&rsquo;ve heard Artie Kane, even if you haven&rsquo;t heard of him. Kane spent decades in Hollywood, composing, conducting, and playing the music to a dizzying number of television shows (<em>Wonder Woman</em>!) and movies (<em>Eyes of Laura Mars</em>!) — and along the way, hobnobbing with the giants of the entertainment industry.</p>

<p><a href="https://amphoraeditions.com/">Amphora Editions</a>, a small publisher with a penchant for the odd and beautiful, is sponsoring us this week to give you an inside look at Kane&rsquo;s new memoir, <em>Music to My Years</em>: a candid and wryly witty account of his life and adventures in entertainment. The <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">sample chapter on our sponsorship page</a> includes cameos by Jascha Heifetz, and Lionel Newman, among others. Stop by and spend a few minutes in 70s-era Hollywood with one of Hollywood&rsquo;s great working musicians.</p>
