<p>We&rsquo;re thrilled to have Kelley Eskridge back as a sponsor this week. Her fantastic book <em>Solitaire</em> has been turned into a feature film, titled <em>Otherlife</em>. That means it&rsquo;s time to read the book before the film arrives into the world. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">Read the entire first chapter</a> on ours sponsors page. Also, check out Kelley&rsquo;s writing <a href="http://kelleyeskridge.com/drink-and-have-feelz-olj-1/">about what it was like to write this film based on her book</a>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">take a look at our open dates</a>. We&rsquo;d love to talk to you about opportunities to sponsor us.</p>
