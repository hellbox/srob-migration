<p>Mark your calendars for Thursday, October 22nd — that&rsquo;s the date for Lit Crawl Seattle, the annual three-part literary pub crawl that happens all over downtown, Capitol Hill, and First Hill. Organizers at Lit Crawl just <a href="http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule">announced their full schedule</a> and it&rsquo;s ridiculously packed with local talent. There are scores of readers — somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 — and dozens of readings to suit just about every literary taste.</p>

<p>A tiny handful of event titles include the self-explanatory &ldquo;Native Writers from Seattle &amp; Beyond;&rdquo; &ldquo;Quick &amp; Dirty: A Reading by [awesome local publisher] Shotgun Wedding;&rdquo; &ldquo;Sin Is Always In: Writings About Sex, Drugs, &amp; Violence;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Late Night at the Library: Spooky Stories in the Stacks.&rdquo; Organizations headlining events include Hedgebrook, the APRIL Festival, the <em>James Franco Review</em>, <em>Poetry Northwest</em>, <em>Spartan</em>, Tin House, Instant Future, and <em>City Arts</em>.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be highlighting potential Lit Crawl routes for you in the weeks to come, but for right now, <a href="http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule">go soak in the glorious too-muchness that is the complete Lit Crawl schedule</a>. You&rsquo;ve got plenty of time to figure out what you&rsquo;ll be doing on the night of the 22nd.</p>
