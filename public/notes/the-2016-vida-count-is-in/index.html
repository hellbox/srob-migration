<p>Find out how your favorite literary publication did in the <a href="http://www.vidaweb.org/the-2016-vida-count/">first VIDA count of the Trump era</a>. (If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with VIDA, it&rsquo;s an organization that counts the number of women — and now, nonbinary — authors in literary publications. One of our very first posts on the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> was <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/27/talking-with-nicola-griffith-about-the-importance-of-counting-womens-stories/">an interview with author Nicola Griffith</a> about the importance of counting women in media.)</p>

<p>This year saw progress at a number of major literary magazines, including the <em>New Yorker</em> and <em>Tin House</em> and the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>. But other organizations like <em>The Nation</em> and <em>Harper&rsquo;s</em>, are actually on the decline. It seems significant, doesn&rsquo;t it, that bylines by women declined at stalwart liberal magazines during the same year in which Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton to win the presidency?</p>
