<p class="noindent">If you frequent the San Juan Islands, you've likely seen Tom Small's sculptures â€” shaped in stone, but the opposite of ponderous. This Thursday, sponsor Arundel Books is celebrating the launch of a new book celebrating Small's work, on their Chatwin imprint, and you're invited to attend.</p>

<p>The book&rsquo;s focus is expansive, gracious images highlighting the sculptor&rsquo;s work and process; the launch party doubles as the opening for a new exhibition, so it should be a truly immersive experience. Stop by Arundel Books in Pioneer Square this Thursday night from 6 to 8 p.m. to sample the sculpture, meet the artist, and help launch a beautiful new book into the world.</p>
