Last week, Joni Balter was nice enough to ask Steve Scher and me to interview Seattle librarian-legend Nancy Pearl on her show *Civic Cocktail*. I asked her how she felt about recent [anti-book library policies](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/26/an-open-letter-to-the-seattle-public-library-board-of-trustees-about-spls-anti-book-agenda/) taking root in the Seattle Public Library and in libraries around the country. You can watch the show below:
