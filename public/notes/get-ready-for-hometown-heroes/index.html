<p>So this is a big deal: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/980701665343279/">Hometown Heroes</a> is a one-day, free, all-ages comics art show &ldquo;formed out of a desire to connect creators, readers, and the stories that bond them in a new way.&rdquo; It happens on <strong>April 8th from 6 to 11 pm</strong> at <a href="http://www.1927events.com/">1927 Events</a> (1927 3rd Ave). I love Emerald City Comicon as much as anyone, but you can&rsquo;t really argue that ECCC gives as much attention to Seattle comics creators as it used to; the show has become a very big, very mainstream event. And that&rsquo;s great! But Hometown Heroes offers a chance for Seattle&rsquo;s indie comics community to show off what they&rsquo;ve been working on, which is just as important. This could be the perfect springtime complement to the <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/short-run-for-the-long-haul/">Short Run Festival</a> in Seattle&rsquo;s comics calendar year.
