<p>On the first day of August, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/08/01/anyone-want-to-buy-a-bookstore-seattle-mystery-bookshop-is-for-sale/">I reported that</a> Pioneer Square mystery bookstore Seattle Mystery Bookshop was for sale. Last night, a number of Seattle-area book journalists received an email from Seattle Mystery Bookshop owner J.B. Dickey. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve received no firm offers for the shop,&rdquo; Dickey says, &ldquo;so it feels as if it is time to start winding things down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most likely the end of the month will be it,&rdquo; Dickey explains. He wants everyone to know that the store is now hosting a big sale: 50 percent off all used books and 30 percent off all new books published before 2017. The bookshop is open from 10 am to 5 pm Monday through Saturday.</p>

<p>If no last-minute buyer comes through, hopefully some other Seattle-area bookstores will hire Seattle Mystery booksellers Fran and Amber, both of whom have years of bookselling experience and are voracious readers.</p>

<p>Stop by the bookshop in the next few days. If you haven&rsquo;t visited in a while, your presence will be much appreciated. If you&rsquo;ve never visited before, you&rsquo;ll want to spend some time in an underappreciated Seattle literary treasure before it goes away forever.</p>
