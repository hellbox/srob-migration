<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1456096014673/9781250067494.jpg" alt="" /></p><strong>MONDAY</strong> <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/mo-daviau">Elliott Bay Book Company</a>  kicks off your Week in Readings. <strong>Mo Daviau</strong> reads from her debut novel, which is titled <em>Every Anxious Wave</em>. Kirkus described it as  a ”punk-rock-time-travel story for the ages.” It’s about a person who finds a time-warp in his closet, which he then leases out to people so they can go back in time and watch their favorite bands play.</p>

<p><strong>TUESDAY</strong> Beloved Seattle young adult author <strong>Sean Beaudoin</strong> debuts his new short story collection, <em>Welcome Thieves</em>, in a release party at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/563533473806840/">Hugo House</a>. Beaudoin promises “Music, cheap booze, a slideshow. Not the usual routine.” <em>Welcome Thieves</em> is his first book for adults.</p>

<p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong> It’s time for a big name: <strong>Jon Krakauer</strong> reads at <a href="https://townhallseattle.org/event/jon-krakauer-with-ross-reynolds/">Town Hall</a>. His latest, <em>Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town</em>, is about the sexual assault epidemic on college campuses around the country. Have you seen this video of Krakauer shutting down a questioner last year? It’s very worth your time:</p>

<p><strong>THURSDAY</strong> Tonight, <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> cofounders <strong>Martin McClellan and Paul Constant</strong> will present our book club picks at the beautiful Bainbridge Island bookstore <a href="http://www.eagleharborbooks.com/event/book-group-night-paul-constant-and-martin-mcclellan">Eagle Harbor Book Company</a>. We invite you to come talk books with us.</p>

<p>But because we always offer additional events when there’s an <em>SRoB</em>-related happening, your <strong>ALTERNATE THURSDAY</strong> event is the very last <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1171909166171010/">Cheap Beer and Prose</a> at the old Hugo House. It’s quite a lineup, too: <strong>Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore, Hanna Brooks Olsen, Jessica Mooney, and Jason Schmidt</strong>. This will be your last chance to buy $1 PBRs from the Hugo House bar. Make it count. (By “make it count,” I mean “drink until you start sobbing and clutching a column in the Hugo House while vowing to never let it go,” obviously.)</p>

<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong> At the downtown branch of the <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/damon-tweedy-md-seattle-public-library">Seattle Public Library</a>, <strong>Dr. Damon Tweedy</strong> will read from his new book, <em>Black Man in a White Coat: A Doctor’s Reflections on Race and Medicine</em>. We know that African-Americans <a href="http://familiesusa.org/product/african-american-health-disparities-compared-to-non-hispanic-whites">receive very poor health care</a> in this country, but up until now, I’m not sure that anyone has really explored, in-depth, how people treat our African-American health care providers. This looks fascinating.</p>

<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong> The <a href="http://www.aawa-seattle.com/">African-American Writers Alliance</a> group reading has become a tradition <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/african-american-writers-alliance-group-reading-0">at Elliott Bay Book Company</a>; the reading started over two decades ago, and it moved to Capitol Hill with the bookstore a few years back. Tonight’s readers: <strong>Alliniece Andino, Margaret Barrie, Jaye Ware, Gaylloyd Sisson, Minnie Collins, Lola Peters, Monique Franklin, Santiago Vega, Helen Collier</strong>, and event organizer <strong>Georgia S. McDade</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong> Celebrated tiny comic convention Exterminator City returns in a new location: Ballard’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/149463042092490/">Push/Pull</a>, at the corner of Market &amp; 24th. About two dozen Seattle cartoonists will be around to sell and discuss their very latest books.</p>
