<p>Katherine Miller <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/katherinemiller/woman-trolls-trump-by-reading-book-of-poems-on-racism-in-the#.wmvnP27PP">at BuzzFeed has compiled</a> a fun, uh, gifsticle(!?) about the woman who very publicly read <a href="https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/citizen">Claudia Rankineâ€™s <em>Citizen</em></a>, a book which &ldquo;investigates the ways in which racism pervades daily American social and cultural life, rendering certain of its citizens politically invisible,&rdquo; at a Donald Trump rally. The thing is, Miller&rsquo;s article didn&rsquo;t cover the best part: the angry white man who tried to get the woman to stop reading and pay attention to Donald Trump, who was, at that exact moment, talking about how much sleep he gets every night. <a href="http://www.tubechop.com/watch/7166079">You should watch that whole interaction play out here</a>.</p>
