<p class="intro">Tonight is Lit Crawl, a bacchanalia of literary events spread over four courses across Capitol Hill, First Hill, and downtown. [You can find the full schedule here](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2017-schedule), but we wanted to provide a few possible itineraries for people who have a hard time making up their minds. See you out on the streets tonight!</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1</strong>: Your evening of writers outside of Seattle begins at Ada&rsquo;s Technical Books. Seattle author Kathleen Flinn tells the story of what happened when one of her books in translation hit the bestseller lists in Japan. She&rsquo;ll talk with her translator and Japanese editor over Skype to discuss the weird trajectory of her writing.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 2</strong>: Then, go to Hugo House for a reading of writers from outside Seattle including Bellingham&rsquo;s Elaina Ellis and Tacoma&rsquo;s Jackie Fender. Keep an eye out especially for Hayat Norimine, who was born in Japan and grew up in Eastern Washington before moving to Seattle and taking over the Publicola politics blog.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 3</strong>: Stay at Hugo House for APRIL Festival co-founder Willie Fitzgerald&rsquo;s conversation with New Zealand author Nic Low, who&rsquo;s here in town as part of a cultural exchange program thanks to the Seattle City of Literature program.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 4</strong>: The last round of readings doesn&rsquo;t have an international component, so why not unwind with a showcase of humiliating true life events featuring Seattle writers Brian McGuigan, Kristen Millares Young, and Sasha LaPointe?</p>

<p class="footer">And don't forget to hit up the big afterparty at the ZoÃ« Events center on Union Street for drinks, more readings, and a ton of books from your favorite readers for sale.</p>
