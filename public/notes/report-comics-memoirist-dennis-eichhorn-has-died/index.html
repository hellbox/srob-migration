<p>Cartoonist J.R. Williams <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206397492190268&amp;set=a.1901014439207.111658.1057064475&amp;type=3&amp;theater">is reporting on Facebook</a> that Northwestern autobiographical comics writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Eichhorn">Dennis Eichhorn</a> has passed away:</p>

<blockquote>Aw, crap. Denny's gone. His wife Jane called to tell me that he passed away this morning. She suggested I put out the word. He was a great friend, and I'm sure gonna miss him.</blockquote>  

<p>Williams and Eichhorn were frequent collaborators, perhaps most notably on <a href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/the-legend-of-wild-man-fischer/417"><em>The Legend of Wild Man Fischer</em></a>.</p>

<p>Eichhorn&rsquo;s <em>Real Stuff</em> comics are wonderful examples of autobiographical comics, true examples of how good the collaboration between writer and artist can be. His comics were often about sex and drugs and rock and roll, but Eichhorn never felt like he was trying to shock his audience, or mythologize his experiences. His comics always felt, simply, like Real Stuff.</p>
