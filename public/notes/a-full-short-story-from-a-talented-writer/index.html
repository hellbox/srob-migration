<p>Sponsor Ronna Wineberg generously gave us permission to run an entire short story from her book <em>Nine Facts That Can Change Your Life</em> for her sponsorship this week. The story, &ldquo;Bare Essentials&rdquo;, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">appears in full on our sponsor&rsquo;s page</a>.</p>

<p>The book received great marks in <em>Kirkus</em> and the <em>Village Voice</em>, but it&rsquo;s what you think that matters most, which is why a full story is such a treat. Be sure to indulge yourself, and if you like it, click through to pick up the book.</p>
