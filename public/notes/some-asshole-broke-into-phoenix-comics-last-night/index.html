<p>On <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PhoenixSeattle/photos/a.252172841574386.1073741826.240420186082985/715492061909126/?type=3&amp;theater">their Facebook page</a>, someone on the Phoenix Comics staff writes:</p>

<blockquote>We wish we had better news to share this morning, but sadly we were the victim of a smash and grab robbery early this morning. Fortunately we have a glass company already working on it and the door should be fixed with no expected interruption to store hours or events today.</blockquote>

<p>The store <a href="https://twitter.com/Phoenix_Comics/status/855465006002880512">reported on Twitter</a> that their door has already been fixed. But still: Boo. What kind of an asshole breaks into a comics shop? (Answer: one of the very bad kinds of assholes, not one of the sort of okay kinds of assholes, like Irish pirate queen Grace O&rsquo;Malley or literally any role Benedict Cumberbatch has ever played.)</p>

<p>If you have a few extra dollars to spend this weekend, maybe drop by Phoenix and pick up a comic or a game. It&rsquo;s important at times like these to come together and make a statement that we do not tolerate this kind of awful bullshittery in our city.</p>
