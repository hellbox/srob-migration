<p>We&rsquo;re very sad to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/esther.altshulhelfgott/posts/10155988212118378?notif_t=comment_mention&amp;notif_id=1489737651586140">share the news</a> that Edmonds poet Joan Swift passed away on March 13th. She was 90 years old. We&rsquo;ll share details of the memorial as soon as we hear them.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with Swift, I would encourage you to <a href="http://www.shewrites.com/profiles/blogs/the-poetry-of-joan-swift-snow">read this interview between Tania Pryputniewicz and Swift</a>, which frankly covers topics including Swift&rsquo;s history of sexual abuse, and how her strength informs her work. She also offers her advice to young women who write, and discusses her time as a student of Northwestern poetry cornerstone Theodore Roethke.</p>

<p><a href="http://kathleenflenniken.com/blog/?p=1760">Kathleen Flenniken ran a good poem of Swift&rsquo;s</a> titled &ldquo;Listening to My Bones&rdquo; a few years ago. It starts with a doctor&rsquo;s visit, in which Swift feels the same kind of nervousness that we all feel when we&rsquo;re sitting in the office. And it ends with Swift&rsquo;s musings on corporeality versus consciousness (or, if you&rsquo;d prefer, spirituality.) This passage is just phenomenal:</p>

<blockquote><p class="noindent">he is listening to the sound of bones</p>
<p class="noindent">the way NASA turns its telescopes far over our heads on Mauna Kea</p>
<p class="noindent">and hears the universe move.</p></blockquote>

<p>Swift is a poet who moved the universe.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll have more to say soon. For now, we send our condolences to her friends and families.</p>
