<p>At the beginning of last night&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/readingthroughit/">Reading Through It Book Club</a> at Third Place Books Seward Park, one of the members of the book club had to ask a question that really should have been answered in the text: What, exactly, is an algorithm? Given that Cathy O&rsquo;Neil&rsquo;s <em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em> — is subtitled &ldquo;<em>How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy</em>&rdquo;, you&rsquo;d think that an explanation of what, exactly, an algorithm is would be addressed in the book. But it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: O&rsquo;Neil generally does a good job of introducing tech-innocent readers to the many ways that data companies are manipulating their daily lives. But she fails to establish a baseline understanding of the tools Facebook, Google, and other companies use to control the user experience, and the book suffers for it.</p>

<p>So for the record, an algorithm is just a process — often a tedious repetition of a formula — that plays out in a fraction of a second. It&rsquo;s often used as a filter, or an interpreter, or a solution to a problem. But like any tool, algorithms can be used for good and bad purposes. And algorithms are always the creation of humans, and they always contain some very human flaws.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Neil does an excellent job in <em>Math</em> of establishing how the biases of software developers play out in the real world. Big data is biased against the poor, and people of color, and other humans that software developers — traditionally white, upper class men — are traditionally biased against.</p>

<p>In education, in the criminal justice system, in credit histories and bank loans, the algorithms and software created by Silicon Valley is conforming to — and in many cases exacerbating — the preexisting prejudices that mainstream American conventional wisdom has always held. And because computers carry with them an air of impartiality, of logic, we often don&rsquo;t think twice when those results reflect our own biases.</p>

<p>With <em>Math</em>, O&rsquo;Neil is performing a valuable service: she&rsquo;s letting readers know that we&rsquo;ve given over many if not most of our major life events — school, employment, health care, everyday purchases — to systems that are just as messy and wrong-headed as any human. The face behind the computer is a human one, and it is not always a friendly face.</p>

<p>So what do we do? The book has very few answers. At this point, it&rsquo;s probably best to just understand how deep these problems run, and to observe how we are affected by the sites and algorithms around us. In that respect, O&rsquo;Neil&rsquo;s book is a perfect first step toward fighting back against the damaged systems being constructed around us every day.</p>

<p>The next Reading Through It meets at Third Place Books Seward Park on Wednesday, February 7th at 7 pm. We&rsquo;ll be discussing Robert Reich&rsquo;s book <a href="https://www.thirdplacebooks.com/book/9781683960607"><em>Economics in Wonderland: A Cartoon Guide to a Political World Gone Mad and Mean</em></a>. The book, which is published by Seattle&rsquo;s own Fantagraphics Books, is now 20% off at Third Place Books. I hope to see you there.</p>
