<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll keep a couple of events in mind as we approach President Trump&rsquo;s inauguration. At <a href="http://townhall.strangertickets.com/events/39723606/writers-resist-a-celebration-of-free-speech?_ga=1.177824679.364931875.1436115723">Town Hall on Sunday, January 15th</a>, Washington writers celebrate Martin Luther King Jr&rsquo;s birthday and celebrate free speech with an event called &ldquo;Writers Resist.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll read their own work and the work of great Americans like Susan B. Anthony, Malcolm X, Susan Sontag, and Thomas Paine. Some of the authors reading include:</p>

<ul>
<li>G. Willow Wilson</li>
<li>Jess Walter</li>
<li>Elissa Washuta</li>
<li>Robert Lashley</li>
<li>Jane Wong</li>
<li>Sam Ligon</li>
<li>Claudia Castro Luna</li>
</ul>

<p>And on Friday, January 20th, Town Hall hosts &ldquo;<a href="http://www.strangertickets.com/events/39288979/post-election-town-hall">We Defy: Voices and Stories from our Progressive Community</a>,&rdquo; a reading produced by Planned Parenthood. This event features Sherman Alexie, Sonya Renee, Ijeoma Oluo, and leaders from the ACLU, Casa Latina, and other progressive organizations &ldquo;to share thoughts, hear from our local leaders about the challenges they expect, and engage in a discussion of how we may work together in the years ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course attending readings isn&rsquo;t the only thing you should do to mobilize in the time ahead. But readings are a great place to start — to meet people, to hear new ideas, and to find inspiration.</p>
