<p>I wanted to be a musician so bad. We&rsquo;d gather at my friend Randy&rsquo;s house, all of us fifteen or so. We&rsquo;d order pizza in, and we&rsquo;d watch <em>Purple Rain</em> on VHS. Maybe a dozen times, we played it. We talked about our band and how cool it was going to be. We talked about Prince, and how great a guitar player and musician he was. He made us feel superhuman.</p>

<p>We have a policy here, on the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>, when big news breaks. We review our posts for the day. Should we halt them, out of respect? Are any of them inappropriate for the tone of the day?</p>

<p>But on the day that Prince dies, what is appropriate? There are no maps for this. Like Bowie, gender was Prince&rsquo;s playground. But although Bowie&rsquo;s death was a surprise to us, it was not to him, he played us off. Prince feels wrong. We&rsquo;ve been robbed. <em>He</em> was robbed. Maybe some sites will try to find a literary angle to cover here. Maybe they&rsquo;ll point to his greatest biography or something. But sometimes, all you have to do is acknowledge.</p>

<p>Watching <em>Purple Rain</em> was transformative. It taught me about making things, because Prince made things. Prince made music. He made movies. He was a gearhead, and a music nerd. He was a scientist and a musical prodigy. He made people dance, and fall in love. He expressed the truest human emotions in the most poignant ways. He was &mdash; not by blood or fiat but by earning every bit of it &mdash; true American royalty. He never stopped. He never gave up. He always was creating. He worked, and worked, and worked.</p>

<p>Thank you for everything, Prince. Anil Dash should have the last word here (and it&rsquo;s worth clicking through to read his whole thread of thoughts on Prince&rsquo;s death):</p>
