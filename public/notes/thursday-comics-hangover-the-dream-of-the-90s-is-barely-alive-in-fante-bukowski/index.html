<p>In the 1990s, a ton of male cartoonists made their careers by writing stories about schlubby men with huge egos. These self-important losers — from Buddy Bradley to Adrian Tomine&rsquo;s protagonists to Ivan Brunetti&rsquo;s self-portrayal — were important at the time: they poked necessary holes in the idea that the only stories worth telling were stories about straight white men of a certain age.</p>

<p>Cartoonist Noah Van Sciver&rsquo;s newest book, <em>Fante Bukowski Two</em>, seems to desperately want to be from the 1990s. It&rsquo;s designed to look like the Black Sparrow edition of Charles Bukowski&rsquo;s <em>Factotum</em>, and it has a completely realistic facsimile of a Borders price sticker on the back cover.</p>

<p>And the content of the book, too, feels ripped from the 1990s. It&rsquo;s a book about a bearded loser who believes himself to be the next Outlaw American Novelist, but who is in fact a talentless hack. Bukowski drinks too much, he lives on donations from his too-tolerant parents, he refuses to get a job. In this book, he lives in a flophouse and makes tons of zines and fails to sell copies all around town.</p>

<p>But the question that Van Sciver fails to answer is: who is this book for? Do we really need another book that skewers bloviating mediocre literary white men? <em>Bukowski</em> feels from the start like the alternative comics from the 1990s, and it never really stops wallowing in nostalgia for that era.</p>

<p>To be fair, Van Sciver is a talented cartoonist, and he has a great sense of comic timing. Parts of <em>Fante Bukowski 2</em> are very funny. But I expect more than “funny” from a Fantagraphics title — the Seattle publisher has such a stellar publication history that I expect some sort of a point from all their books. Unfortunately, <em>Bukowski</em> feels like an exquisitely crafted fan fiction tribute to Fantagraphics titles from a bygone era.</p>

<p>And this question might seem petty, but it’s actually quite important: Do people like the person this book is supposedly satirizing even <em>exist</em> anymore? Do Bukowski acolytes still talk about the authentic human experience and produce zines to distribute at open mic nights? To me, this feels like a time-capsule, a skewering that arrives twenty years too late.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Van Sciver shouldn’t satirize white men, or that white men aren’t a relevant target anymore; quite the contrary. We live in a time in which <a href="https://la.eater.com/2017/10/9/16448332/mcdonalds-mulan-szechwan-sauce-rick-morty-riot-police">mobs of bored white dudes are starting riots</a> because their preferred flavor of corn syrup isn’t available at their local McDonald’s. If the self-entitled jackass star of <em>Bukowski</em> were alive today, his obsessions and behavior would likely be very different. With its obsessive backwards stare, <em>Bukowski</em> feels stale and hopelessly retro.</p>
