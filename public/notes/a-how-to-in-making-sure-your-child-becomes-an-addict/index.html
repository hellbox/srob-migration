<p>Discovering new writers can be really hard. It&rsquo;s the reason we started our sponsorship program, and J.A. Wright is exactly the kind of writer we built it for. She&rsquo;s bringing her superbly wrought debut novel <em>How To Grow an Addict</em> to our site this week.</p>

<p>On our <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">sponsor&rsquo;s page we have the prologue and first chapter</a>, so you can read enough to discover that this is indeed a book you want to invest in. Follow the story of Randall, consigned to rehab and sure that she&rsquo;s the only one there with <em>good</em> reasons for her boozing and drugging. But Wright does something extraordinary in the canon of addiction literature: she uncovers the why; she tells the story of the steps it took to build an addict.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s thanks to sponsors like J.A. Wright, and readers like you, that we&rsquo;re able to keep the pixels lit up here at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>. We&rsquo;ve <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">just released our next block of sponsorship opportunities</a>.
