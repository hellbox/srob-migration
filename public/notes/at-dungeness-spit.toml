Rushing toward the ocean tongue<br>
Along the lip of land

I am what my friends feared

Grit traded in for grains of sand<br>
My city soil scattered in Northwest winds

Twice despised for behavior unbecoming&mdash;

Unable to leave the cascade light<br>
Unwilling to claim the shadowed coo of pigeonâ€™s songs as my only note.
