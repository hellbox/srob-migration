<p>Great news! Seattle&rsquo;s next Civic Poet will be Anastacia-Renée, who until recently was the poet-in-residence at the Hugo House. Appropriately, I <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/07/19/literary-event-of-the-week-forget-it-reading-at-elliott-bay-book-company/">just wrote about Anastacia-Renee&rsquo;s ubiquitousness a couple weeks ago</a>, and I <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/we-the-poems/">wrote about the importance of the Civic Poet program</a> last week. It&rsquo;s like it was meant to be.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://artbeat.seattle.gov/2017/07/31/anastacia-renee-tolbert-selected-as-seattles-next-civic-poet/">the city&rsquo;s announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>“When poetry takes center stage, tension filled spaces become safe literary hubs where community members can gather to share and celebrate the plethora of local, historical, and contemporary voices,” says Anastacia-Reneé. “I’m excited to forge creative new literary paths that lay beyond the standard expectations of poetry.”</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully, we&rsquo;ll be talking with Anastacia-Renée in the next couple of weeks about her plans for the new gig. She has quite a legacy to live up to; the first Civic Poet, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/authors/claudia-castro-luna/">Claudia Castro Luna</a>, has done a great deal to represent poetry in the city. We can&rsquo;t wait to see what she has in store.</p>
