<p>To tell the truth, I have forgotten<br>
which year goes with what.</p>

<p>My memory: as good as milk.<br>
My family: spoiled through</p>

<p>and through. Pure as mold<br>
on a September nectarine,</p>

<p>we refuse to announce defeat,<br>
death. In this house, the margins</p>

<p>of mourning are tucked in,<br>
pleated to the neck.</p>

<p>In August, my uncle dies<br>
and no one tells his children.</p>

<p>He crosses his arms<br>
in a blue suit in a coffin</p>

<p>where the ants<br>
want in. In December,</p>

<p>my brother and I bundle up<br>
for a storm that goes</p>

<p>through another town.<br>
What were we preparing for?</p>

<p>My mother warns us:<br>
beware of well-lit places.</p>

<p>Beware of fires burning<br>
in the dark. If there is a spider</p>

<p>under your cup,<br>
what will you do about it?</p>
