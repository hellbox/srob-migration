<p>I am all for the idea of states naming official books. (<em>Make Way for Ducklings</em> is, adorably, Massachusetts&rsquo;s official children&rsquo;s book.) But I&rsquo;m not a fan of <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/04/bill-make-bible-official-state-book-heads-haslam/82625250/">this move</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Tennessee is poised to make history as the first state in the nation to recognize the Holy Bible as its official book.</blockquote>

<p>The problem is, of course, Tennessee lawmakers aren&rsquo;t just naming a state book by doing this; they&rsquo;re effectively naming Christianity the official state religion. Instead of the Bible, a book that I can promise was neither written nor set in Tennessee, why not make Cormac McCarthy&rsquo;s semiautobiographical novel <em>Suttree</em> the state book instead? It&rsquo;s set in Tennessee, and it&rsquo;s an underappreciated McCarthy novel. Why not promote literacy, rather than waging a petty and unnecessary religious war?</p>
