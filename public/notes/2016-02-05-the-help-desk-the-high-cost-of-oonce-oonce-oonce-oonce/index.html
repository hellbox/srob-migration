        <p class="intro">*Every Friday, Cienna Madrid offers solutions to life’s most vexing literary problems. Do you need a book recommendation to send your worst cousin on her birthday? Is it okay to read erotica on public transit? Cienna can help. Send your questions to* advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

<p><strong>Help! My boyfriend and I are both serious readers. We spend most of our nights in working through our piles of books. We even got rid of our TV.</strong></p>

<p><strong>But we didn&rsquo;t get rid of our stereo, and he insists on having it on while he reads. He listens to the most awful club music, all &ldquo;oonce oonce oonce oonce”. It drives me crazy. I literally cannot concentrate while all that racket is on. He says if it’s too quiet, something feels wrong to him, and he can’t focus.  It&rsquo;s like he has a second person in his brain, who he needs to distract so that he can read.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We&rsquo;ve been alternating nights, one with music, one without, but the person who can&rsquo;t read that night just ends up on the goddamnned computer, cranky because they’d rather be reading their book. What can we do to address this?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Mark, on Harvard**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Mark,</p>

<p>You know who else hates &ldquo;oonce oonce oonce&rdquo; music? Spiders. Nothing saps the serenity of a bookish night at home more than seeing hundreds of spiders skittering about, angrily drumming thousands of tiny legs on your walls as if to spell in morse code T-U-R-N-T-H-A-T-F-O-U-L-S-H-I-T-O-F-F.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Valentines Day is upon us. Call me old fashioned but I can&rsquo;t think of a more romantic gift to get your bf than a pregnant wolf spider. If you were not aware, wolf spiders are agile hunters (with positively buxom abdomens, if you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing) who dislike music of any sort – even Buena Vista Social Club, a universal spider favorite! – and are known to release venom when provoked.</p>

<p>Alternately, you could buy your bf a quality pair of headphones. Or buy yourself a quality pair of noise-canceling headphones. What you cannot do is buy your spiders headphones. The technology simply is not there.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
