If you want a portrait of a friend, loved one, pet, or even yourself (immortalize your bossest selfie!) for your own wall, or as the most thoughtful gift you can possibly imagine, <a href="http://www.christinelarsen.com/sketchbook/2016/9/30/portrait-commissions.html">then please do reach out. There&rsquo;s more information on her website</a>.</p>
