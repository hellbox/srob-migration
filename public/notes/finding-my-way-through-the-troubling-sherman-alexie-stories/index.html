<p>I believe the women who <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2018/03/05/npr-publishes-report-accusing-sherman-alexie-of-harassment/">talked to NPR about being sexually harassed by Sherman Alexie</a>. I admire the bravery that it must have taken to speak up against such a powerful man in the literary community. I hope that sharing their stories helps them find some emotional peace, and if there are others out there who have had the same experience as these women — as we&rsquo;ve learned in the last six months, there are often more women — I hope that they find inspiration in the courage that these women displayed.</p>

<p>Before we go any further, let&rsquo;s be clear about some of the arguments that devil&rsquo;s advocates are going to bring up in the wake of NPR&rsquo;s report. You&rsquo;ll likely hear some conversation about due process; that, of course, is not the point. There&rsquo;s no trial, here. Alexie is accused of a breach of ethics, of using his power and prestige to intimidate young authors and coax them into sexual acts. It&rsquo;s up to all of us — as moral beings, as keepers of our own ethical codes — to decide how we interpret and respond to those accusations.</p>

<p>Some people will probably argue that calling for an author to &ldquo;go away&rdquo; is just a case of &ldquo;mob mentality.&rdquo; Nobody is calling for Alexie&rsquo;s books to be burned, or for Alexie to be pilloried in town square. We don&rsquo;t expect our authors to be perfect heroes. But we do expect that when we give them a platform, they will use that platform responsibly. We do expect that when we invite them to our readings, or into our minds, they won&rsquo;t use their fame to take advantage of others.</p>

<p>After seeing these reports — reports which, by the way, follow <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2018/03/01/the-seattle-times-publishes-a-report-on-the-allegations-against-sherman-alexie/">a statement in which Alexie himself confirms</a> that he has &ldquo;done things that have harmed other people&rdquo; — it&rsquo;s up to every reader to decide where they stand on Sherman Alexie&rsquo;s literary works. Some, no doubt, will continue to admire him. Others will feel betrayed. There will be as many different responses as there are readers. This is not a mob. This is a large group of readers — of fans — coming to terms with a new reality.</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make this about me, because it&rsquo;s not. But I think I have to disclose my connections to Alexie, to continue the conversation started by those brave women on NPR yesterday. For as long as I&rsquo;ve been working with books in Seattle, Sherman Alexie has been a part of my life. The week after I started working at Elliott Bay Book Company in 2000, I sold books at an Alexie reading at Town Hall. I&rsquo;d never seen him read before, and I instantly became a fan. I especially liked how generous he was to the booksellers — how he thanked us for our time.</p>

<p>And once I started writing about books, Alexie became a more prominent and personal figure in my life. I helped select Alexie for a <em>Stranger</em> Genius award. I wrote about almost all of his books. I hosted quite a few readings with Alexie and interviewed him several times. I exchanged many emails with him.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know any of this about Alexie — but then, I suppose it makes sense that I wouldn&rsquo;t have known. Alexie presented himself to me the same way he presented himself onstage: as a married man who sometimes engaged in harmless puppydog crushes on celebrities and women he might notice in passing on the street. I first learned about the charges against Alexie a month ago, after a bookseller sent an email alerting me to the anonymous allegations. Since that time, I&rsquo;ve heard both firsthand and secondhand accounts of women who felt victimized by Alexie. Those accounts sound similar to the stories in the NPR report. I believe them, too.</p>

<p>At first, I was shocked to hear the stories. As I&rsquo;ve heard more, as I&rsquo;ve talked to reporters and read the stories and accounts, I&rsquo;ve felt a growing amount of shame.</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p>It makes me sick to my stomach to think that one of my events or reviews might have been the incident that inspired a young woman to reach out to Alexie, only to be harassed by him. It makes me feel even worse to think that someone might have wanted to tell a member of the media about their experiences with Alexie, but that they might have considered that I would not have believed them because I&rsquo;ve been so closely affiliated with him over the years.</p>

<p>And so personally, for me as a reader? Until last month, I believed in the Alexie that presented himself onstage. I loved his willingness to stand up to bullies, to acknowledge human frailty, to speak beautiful truths. But based on what I have heard now, I have no stomach for him or for his work anymore. The distance between the personal story presented in his writing and the stories I&rsquo;ve heard is too far. I can&rsquo;t read those words anymore without thinking about all the pain they&rsquo;re printed over.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not unique in this. You, reading this, will have to formulate your own response to this news. We as a community will be coming to terms with the story over the next days and weeks and months and years. Seattle is a strong city with a mighty literary community, and our people are compassionate and intelligent and we take care of our own.</p>

<p>I have hope that we can figure out how to learn from this moment — that we can find ways to protect our friends and neighbors from abuses of power; that we will create a community that includes voices, rather than silences them; that we will listen, and be listened to. I believe that if we work together, we can remember our goal as a literary community: to tell stories that make the world a better, more just, more empathetic place.</p>
