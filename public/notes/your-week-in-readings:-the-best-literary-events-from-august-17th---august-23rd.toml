<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1470809472551/necessarytrouble.jpg)</p><p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday August 22: *Necessary Trouble: Americans in Revolt* **</h5></p>
America was built on revolution, and our Constitution allows for argument as a part of the process. This gives us a natural advantage over, say, France. Sarah Jaffe’s newest book is a history of American revolutions, from those early days in New England up through Black Lives Matter and the fight for $15. 
*Seattle Public Library, 1000 4th Ave., 386-4636, http://spl.org. Free. All ages. 7 p.m*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday August 23: *Words to Color By* **</h5></p>
Certain literary snobs like to mock coloring books for adults, but fuck those guys. Coloring makes people feel good, the books are helping the bottom lines of indie bookstores, and they’re fun. Tonight, local artist Jennifer Lankenau hosts a debut and coloring party for her first coloring book.
*University Book Store Mill Creek, 15311 Main St., 425-385-3530. ubookstore.com. Free. All ages. Noon.*
