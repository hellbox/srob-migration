Seattle poet Jane Wong is a phenomenal talent. She’s young for a poet, but she’s already won a ton of awards and recognitions (the Stanley Kunitz Memorial Prize, the Kundiman fellowship) and tonight she’s debuting her first full-length poetry collection, <em>Overpour</em>. Tonight’s the night when a promising, impressive talent finally becomes a celebrated author.

<h5><strong>Monday October 24th: <em>The Wangs vs. the World</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Debut authors are storming the gates at Elliott Bay this week: Brit Bennett reads from her much-acclaimed <em>The Mothers</em> on Tuesday, but for my money Jade Chang’s novel about a Chinese-American family that suffers a streak of bad luck is the one to beat. Her reading tonight should be funny, smart, and fascinating.  <em>Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, <a href="http://elliottbaybook.com ">http://elliottbaybook.com </a>. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. </em></p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Tuesday October 25th: #Journalismsowhite</strong></h5></p>
Seattle has its fair share of intelligent, curious, thoughtful journalists, but GodDAMN is the Seattle journalism scene incredibly white. Like, blindingly so. Tonight, a panel of journalists from outlets like the <em>Globalist</em>, the <em>South Seattle Emerald</em>, and <em>Grist</em> get together to discuss what this homogeneity means and how to diversify the scene. <em>Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m. </em></p>
