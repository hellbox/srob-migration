<p>The <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> is officially an endorser of the <a href="http://seattlecityoflit.org/">city&rsquo;s bid to become designated a UNESCO City of Literature</a>. This is because we believe Seattle is a world-class book city, and the designation would allow us to share our art with other UNESCO Creative Cities around the world. Additionally, if we earned the designation, the city would establish an office to oversee the city&rsquo;s literary scene, which could create some exceptional opportunities for collaboration and community outreach.</p>

<p>Seattle City of Literature, the organization behind the bid, has created a video explaining why Seattle&rsquo;s literary scene deserves the UNESCO City of Literature designation. It&rsquo;s a fine video, even though that introductory scene from Mayor Murray is a little rough — was <em>that</em> the best take? — but on the whole, it&rsquo;s a fine encapsulation of the features that make us such a great city for literature.</p>
