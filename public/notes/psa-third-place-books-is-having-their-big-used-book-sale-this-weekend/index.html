<p>On November 5th and 6th, Third Place Books is having their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1066315310151796/">semi-annual used book sale</a>. Every used book at all three Third Place locations will be 40 percent off. And they&rsquo;re trying something new this time around: if you visit and spend at least $5 at each location, you&rsquo;ll get a $10 gift card. It&rsquo;s going to be a long winter, and this is a great way to stock up your nightstand.</p>
