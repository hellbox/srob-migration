Tobias Carroll [at Vol. 1 Brooklyn](http://www.vol1brooklyn.com/2016/07/11/why-did-google-delete-dennis-coopers-blog/) writes that Dennis Cooper's lively blog has completely disappeared:

<blockquote>...late last month, Google deleted both Cooper’s blog and his Gmail account without providing any advance notice to him. Visiting the URL now brings up an error page stating that the page has been removed, and that “[t]his address is not available for new blogs.”</blockquote>

Cooper is currently updating the situation [on his Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Dennis-Coopers-Blog-214073142012494), though he does not have very much to report at the moment. (*Thanks to* SRoB *tipper **Clinton**.*)
