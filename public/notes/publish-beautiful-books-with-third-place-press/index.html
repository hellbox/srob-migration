<p class="noindent">Sponsor Third Place Press is back again this week, this time to talk about their first-rate book production studio. If you're a writer thinking of self-publishing, check them out: They're home to the only Espresso Book Machine in the Pacific Northwest — [she goes by "Ginger"](https://www.thirdplacebooks.com/espresso-book-machine-third-place-press-faq) — perfect for printing your own work. And they provide a range of production support, helping authors create books that are professionally (and elegantly) designed to fit the content. [Our sponsor page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/) has a full description of their offerings.</p>

<p>Sponsors like Third Place Press make the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> possible. Did you know you could sponsor us as well? If you have a book, event, or opportunity you’d like to get in front of our readers, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/">send us a note</a>. We’d be delighted to reserve a spot for you.</p>
