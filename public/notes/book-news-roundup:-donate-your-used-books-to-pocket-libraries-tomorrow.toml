* Tomorrow is the Seattle 7 Writers Holiday Bookfest, which I wrote about for [this week's Literary Event of the Week column](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/11/16/literary-event-of-the-week-seattle-7-writers-bookfest/). This is a great event and you should go, for all the reasons I explained. However, I made one error in the column that I want to amend here: I wrote... "...And if youâ€™d like to make your neighborhood a more literate place, feel free to bring some 'gently used books,' which Seattle 7 Writers will then distribute to little free libraries around the city." That is actually slightly wrong: Seattle 7 Writers will definitely accept your used books, but they will instead use them for their terrific [Pocket Library program](http://www.seattle7writers.org/pocket-libraries.html), which is even better than donating them to Little Free Libraries. Here's what the Pocket Libraries are, from their own website:

<blockquote>Pocket libraries at a wide variety of sites provide invaluable reading material for women, men, and children who are currently without bookshelves of their own. Since 2010, we have donated over 30,000 books to local shelters, food banks, literacy organizations, recovery and counseling sites, and detention centers.</blockquote>

* I regret the above error. Please give to [Seattle 7's Pocket Libraries](http://www.seattle7writers.org/pocket-libraries.html) if you can.

* While we're referring back to old posts, that British Amazon ad about religious tolerance [I was talking about a couple days back](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/11/16/new-amazon-ad-is-probably-pretty-inspiring-though-i-wouldnt-know/) has finally [been made available to American audiences](http://www.geekwire.com/2016/jeff-bezos-tweets-love-touching-amazon-ad-showing-friendship-priest-imam/). 

* Does the world need more hatchet job book reviews? [DJ Taylor at the *New Statesman*](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/11/death-hatchet-job) seems to think so.

* Is it time to retire the phrase "graphic novel?" [Glenn Weldon at NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2016/11/17/502422829/the-term-graphic-novel-has-had-a-good-run-we-dont-need-it-anymore) seems to think so.
