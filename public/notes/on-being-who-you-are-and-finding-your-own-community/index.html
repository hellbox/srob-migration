<p class="noindent">Sponsor Anna Redsand is coming to Seattle to do a reading, and discussion with Ann Przyzycki, the editor of [_Isthmus_](http://www.isthmusreview.com/), about publishing. This event, on December 3rd, will be a great resource for writers interested in publication from the author and publisher's perspective, as well as doing a DIY book tour, and the kinds of challenges faced by writers and publishers.</p> 

<p>Redsand is also supporting her book <em>To Drink From the Silver Cup: From Faith Through Exile and Beyond</em>. You can <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">read the Prologue from the book on our sponsor&rsquo;s page,</a> it&rsquo;s a great investigation into faith, coming out as who you truly are when those around you might exclude you because of who you are, and how to find community and faith by expanding your world view. More details on all of this, the reading and the book itself, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">on our sponsor&rsquo;s page</a>.</p>
