<p class="intro">_And God said "&hellip; I'm lonely_<br>
_I'll make me a world."_<br>
â€” James Weldon Johnson<br>
"The Creation"</p>

<p>Tell us your stories<br>
August Wilson</p>

<p>Remind us<br>
of the voices you hear<br>
Boy Willie<br>
Ma Rainey<br>
Aunt Esther&rsquo;s children</p>

<p>Bring forth for us<br>
the visions you hear<br>
King Hedley<br>
Fences<br>
Two Trains Running</p>

<p>Conjure up for us<br>
Langston&rsquo;s words<br>
&ldquo;Life for me ain&rsquo;t been<br>
no crystal stair, but<br>
I&rsquo;s climbin&rdquo;</p>

<p>August Wilson<br>
keep dippin&rsquo; your fingers<br>
in the waters<br>
Tell Freedom<br>
We&rsquo;z ready<br>
Take our love<br>
with you<br>
Take our love</p>

<p><em>for Constanza</em><br>
<em>&amp; all of us</em></p>
