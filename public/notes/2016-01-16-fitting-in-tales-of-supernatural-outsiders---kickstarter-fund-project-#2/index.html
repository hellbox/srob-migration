<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">_[Fitting In: Tales of Supernatural Outsiders](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bolthy/fitting-in-tales-of-supernatural-outsiders?ref=discovery)_. We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Jeremy Zimmerman](http://www.bolthy.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>A collection of urban fantasy stories about supernatural entities in a world not made for them.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">Local talent! Jeremy, and his wife Dawn Vogel, run the <a href="http://madscientistjournal.org" title="Mad Scientist Journal | The Academic Journal for the Misunderstood Genius">_Mad Scientist Journal_</a> website, where they publish "a new story from the world of mad science every Monday." This is their fourth collection they've produced using Kickstarter.</p> 

<p>I like the theme of outsiders, especially when mixed with the supernatural. Since Frankenstein, monster stories have been used as metaphors for feeling apart from other people. I like that they&rsquo;re tackling that straight on. And, as they say, &ldquo;we are particularly interested in stories beyond the usual Western supernatural population. Vampires and werewolves are fine, but we&rsquo;d really love to also see stories tapping into African and Asian myths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You can get a copy of the book as cheap as $15, which is a nice price for helping bring something like this to life.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">Support local small publishers! Genre stuff like this often gets put on the side table, if you're not in the fan base, but there's a particular pleasure in cracking a good themed anthology. You owe yourself the experience, if you never have &mdash; you may think you know what you're going to get, but there are always surprises.</p>

<p>Plus, work like this is a labor of love. I would guess that Jeremy and Dawn are putting these projects out because they love them, they want to give back to their community, and because they&rsquo;re filling a gap where they wanted to read deeply where other people weren&rsquo;t publishing. I hazard to say that nobody&rsquo;s getting rich, here. It&rsquo;s about bringing things they love to fruition.</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">At 33 days to go, and only about 11% there. But, based on their track record, I imagine they'll make the mark</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
