        <p class="intro">Every week, the _Seattle Review of Books_ backs a Kickstarter, and writes up why we picked that particular project. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/08/announcing-the-seattle-review-of-books-kickstarter-fund/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Announcing the Seattle Review of Books Kickstarter Fund">Read more about the project here</a>.

<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_People Of Color Take Over Fantastic Stories_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1271384462/people-of-color-take-over-fantastic-stories). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Warren Lapine](http://www.fantasticstoriesoftheimagination.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
Fantastic Stories is a top paying market that is open and looking for stories from underrepresented communities and cultures.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>
    

<p class="noindent">
Well, first, we need to offer a _complete and total nepotism / conflict of interest_ report: Nisi Shawl, who writes our SFFH column <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-future-alternative-past" title="The Seattle Review of Books">the Future Alternative Past</a>, is the guest editor in question if this Kickstarter succeeds, so let us say this clearly and without reserve: _you cannot trust our objectivity on this_. 
</p>

<p>But still, are you kidding me? A complete POC take over issue is a fantastic idea, and good on <em>Fantastic Stories of the Imagination</em> (for those of you, like me, who were curious about the title&rsquo;s remarkable resemblence to ye olde classic <em>Fantastic Stories</em>, editor Warren Lapine <a href="http://www.fantasticstoriesoftheimagination.com/editorial/" title="Editorial: Welcome to Fantastic Stories of the Imagination &amp;#8211; Fantastic Stories">tells the story here</a>) for taking this important step. This is the kind of project we like funding. Also, Nisi explains it well in the video, so please do watch that.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
Because there are people that actually complain about stuff like this. Did you know that? People who think its "politically correct" or "reverse-racist", or something equally idiotic, to focus a magazine on people of color. As Nisi says "there persists a perception that science fiction and fantasy is somehow a white field". Now, that's just stupid. In an article on the website, Nisi points out black people <a href="http://www.fantasticstoriesoftheimagination.com/a-crash-course-in-the-history-of-black-science-fiction/" title="A Crash Course in the History of Black Science Fiction &amp;#8211; Fantastic Stories">have been involved with the genre since the very beginning</a>. 
</p>

<p>As fans, it&rsquo;s imperative to stand up and say that what we care about most is good stories, and the authors she&rsquo;s picked to highlight are certainly going to deliver on that front. Let&rsquo;s make sure they get the chance, yes?</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    They're just getting started, at 13% funded, and 32 days to go.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
