<p class="noindent">The title says it all: _Blip_. That's how long we've got, here. When sponsor Ken Boynton was in a nearly-fatal car accident, his perspective changed. _Blip_ was his way to communicate his new-found awe for our short time on this planet.</p> 

<p>See six spreads from this short, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">important book on our sponsor&rsquo;s page</a>, and take a moment to consider your awareness of this moment. Like one reviewer on Amazon said: &ldquo;&hellip;this book should be read by everyone multiple times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sponsors like Ken Boynton make the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> possible. Did you know we sold out our last sponsorship run? We&rsquo;re booked solid through February 2018, but if you have a book, event, or project you&rsquo;d like to get in front of our readers, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/">reach out and let us know</a>. We&rsquo;ll be able to crack open our calendars and reserve you ahead of the pack.</p>
