        <h5>[The Most Misread Poem in America](http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/09/11/the-most-misread-poem-in-america/)</h5>

<p>David Orr, in an excerpt from his book <em>The Road Not Taken: Finding America in the Poem Everyone Loves and Almost Everyone Gets Wrong</em>, on Robert Frost&rsquo;s best known poem.</p>

<blockquote>
    Frost’s poem turns this expectation on its head. Most readers consider “The Road Not Taken” to be a paean to triumphant self-assertion (“I took the one less traveled by”), but the literal meaning of the poem’s own lines seems completely at odds with this interpretation. The poem’s speaker tells us he “shall be telling,” at some point in the future, of how he took the road less traveled by, yet he has already admitted that the two paths “equally lay / In leaves” and “the passing there / Had worn them really about the same.” So the road he will later call less traveled is actually the road _equally_ traveled. The two roads are interchangeable.

<h5>[This Is How You Become an Editor](https://catapult.co/stories/this-is-how-you-become-an-editor)</h5>

<p>Mensah Demary on the kind of work writers do, so that they can do the sort of work that writers do.</p>

<blockquote>
    I was gifted, or cursed, with a brain somewhat wired for business. My father knew as much about me; when, in 2007, I said to him, “Maybe I should finish undergrad, then get an MFA,” he retorted, “You should probably get an MBA instead.” I took this advice as an insult, or a devaluing of my creative desires, but I couldn’t ignore it. I was raised by this man, directed through life as child with the goal of growing into a self-sustaining adult.
