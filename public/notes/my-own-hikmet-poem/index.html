<p><em>&mdash; it’s 1962 March 28th</em></p>

<p>it’s 2017 September 19th.<br>
I’m sitting at the window on the 3rd floor of fog.<br>
Day is rising.<br>
I never knew I liked<br>
morning lifting like a conductor’s baton.</p>

<p>I didn’t know I loved my body.<br>
Can someone who hates their body love it.<br>
I’ve always schemed against my body.<br>
It’s just like all my other lovers.</p>

<p>I’ve loved long roads all my life &mdash; the flat<br>
macadam itself listening under the mist of lamps, no traffic at the<br>
hour. I know that road is both obscured and obvious.<br>
I know its lights aren’t enough to see &mdash;</p>

<p>I love to close my eyes and look at your eyes<br>
and see if your eyes are still closed.</p>
