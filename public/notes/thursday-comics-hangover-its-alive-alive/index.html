<p>Victor LaValle is one of the most underappreciated novelists in America today. His debut novel <em>The Ecstatic</em> was less a shaky first outing and more a spectacular announcement of a singular talent. His last three novels — <em>Big Machine</em>, <em>The Devil in Silver</em>, and <em>The Ballad of Black Tom</em> — have addressed America&rsquo;s complicated relationship with race through the lens of horror fiction. (And before you ask, LaValle began exploring this relationship years before <em>Get Out</em> was anything more than a figment of Jordan Peele&rsquo;s imagination.) When it comes to genre fiction, he&rsquo;s one of our most fearless adventurers.</p>

<p>And now LaValle has conquered another medium. Yesterday saw the publication of the sixth and final issue of LaValle&rsquo;s very first comic series, <em>Destroyer</em>. Illustrated by Dietrich Smith, <em>Destroyer</em> is a modern-day recasting of the Frankenstein story. But this isn&rsquo;t a reboot; <em>Destroyer</em> is a sequel to <em>Frankenstein</em>. The original monster from the Wollstonecraft novel is still alive and menacing the characters of this story.</p>

<p><em>Destroyer</em>&rsquo;s protagonist is a black teenage boy named Akai whose mother brings him back from the dead after he&rsquo;s slain by police. The book explores the mother-son dynamic and, since the mother is a descendent of Victor Frankenstein, the monster serves as a kind of lingering ancestral wrath. It&rsquo;s a story of grief and tradition and learning what you can and can&rsquo;t control about the things (and people) you create.</p>

<p>This sixth and final issue of <em>Destroyer</em> combines all those threads into one climactic scene. Every character gets an opportunity to make their case. (&ldquo;Must be nice to be a father,&rdquo; Akai&rsquo;s mother notes bitterly, &ldquo;Mothers are weighed on a broken scale.&rdquo;) The dynamics shift and realign and play out against a backdrop of America&rsquo;s forgotten history.</p>

<p>LaValle and Smith are creating high-level comics here. It&rsquo;s a book that is as personal as a love-letter, as brutally honest as a confession, and as of-the-moment as your Twitter feed. The final confrontation between Akai, his mother, and his father is just as internal and complex as any literary novel, but — because this is comics — it involves a giant, lumbering mech-battlesuit in mortal combat with a reanimated monster and a severed head.</p>

<p>The collected edition of <em>Destroyer</em> is set to arrive in bookstores in March of next year; if you&rsquo;ve enjoyed allegorical takes on race in America like <em>The Underground Railroad</em> or <em>Get Out</em>, I urge you to reserve a copy at your favorite independent bookstore today.</p>
