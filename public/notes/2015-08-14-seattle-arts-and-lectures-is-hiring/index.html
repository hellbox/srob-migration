        <p>Do you want to help kids learn how to love writing? Seattle Arts and Lectures is looking for a new program director for their <a href="http://www.lectures.org/wits/how_wits_works.php">Writers in the Schools</a> program. It sounds like a tough job, but it&rsquo;s definitely worth it:</p>

<blockquote>The WITS Program Director is responsible for establishing and maintaining high quality writer residencies, creating and managing the program budget, leading development of program strategy, supporting classroom teachers and writers-in-residence throughout the year, stewarding relationships with schools and other program partners, recruiting new schools and writers, program assessment, and collaborating with staff and board members on fundraising, public relations, and marketing as well as general SAL administration.</blockquote>

<p>And if program-directing is not your thing, you could also consider the <a href="http://www.lectures.org/about_us/opportunities.php?id=21">Community Engagement Coordinator</a> position. The application deadline for both positions is August 31st. <a href="http://www.lectures.org/about_us/opportunities.php?id=20">Go do it</a>.</p>
