<p class="noindent">Sponsor Brian McKreevy's new novel _The Lights_ is being released next week. It's a philosophical inquiry into the nature of how we connect in our most intimate bonds &mdash; and, bonus, it starts when gifted writer Leda Galvan moves to Austin to join an MFA program. It's an examination of love and art, all set in Texas among aspirational writers.</p> 

<p>That&rsquo;s something McKreevy knows all about &mdash; he was a James Michener Fellow in fiction and screenwriting at the University of Texas. He&rsquo;s also the author of <em>Hemlock Grove</em>, a gothic novel produced by Netflix into a series. He&rsquo;s &ldquo;alarmingly talented&rdquo;, and one reviewer said &ldquo;<em>The Lights</em> is a funny and honest look at how we negotiate our own morality on a sliding scale.&rdquo; <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">Read more on our sponsors page</a> â€” and get ready for <em>The Lights</em>, coming out next week.</p>
