<p>On Mars, water once flowed. Where<br>
did it go? Some froze, but scientists</p>

<p>suspect a cosmic cue ball &mdash; a comet<br>
etc. &mdash; knocked Mars so hard</p>

<p>the planet escaped<br>
its own atmosphere, just</p>

<p>left it there, jumped its own skin<br>
like an anime cat</p>

<p>leaving his pajamas spread-eagle<br>
in space. And now, goddammit,</p>

<p>David Bowie is dead.<br>
I worshipped him like a flower</p>

<p>twists its dewy face to the brightest,<br>
prettiest star. He asked us,</p>

<p>decades down, “Is there life on Mars?”<br>
Once, perhaps. There once was life</p>

<p>in Bowie too. Stars glitter,<br>
planets don’t &mdash;</p>

<p>an atmospheric parlor trick,<br>
but neither titan ceases</p>

<p>to exist just because<br>
a little air escaped.</p>
