<p>KUOW reporter Marcie Sillman <a href="http://kuow.org/post/we-love-digital-world-theres-nothing-old-fashioned-book">filed a piece this morning</a> about a new book conservation program at the University of Washington:</p>

<blockquote>More than 10,000 items flow through the center every year; everything from fragile maps that need protective casings to books with torn bindings. Most of the binding work is outsourced to commercial binderies, but in-house conservators tend to the rare books, pamphlets and other delicate materials.</blockquote>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered about the preservation of books, this is very much worth your time. Full disclosure: Sillman quotes me in the piece, but despite my involvement it&rsquo;s very much worth your while.</p>
