<li><p>Paul Tumey at the <em>Comics Journal</em> wrote <a href="http://www.tcj.com/mark-campos-1962-2018-seattles-unsung-comics-master-remembered/">a lovely, detailed remembrance of Seattle cartoonist Mark Campos</a>, who passed away in January. Campos was an incredibly supportive cartoonist, reader, and friend. I can&rsquo;t quite bring myself to accept that I won&rsquo;t bump into him at the next Short Run. He was devoted to cartooning, and to Seattle, and to all his many friends. I&rsquo;ll miss Mark very much, and Tumey&rsquo;s piece is a good and fitting tribute to his life.</p></li>

It sounds like a fantastic opportunity, and I&rsquo;ve talked with several women who have loved the experience.</p></li>

Residents are responsible for their own breakfast, lunch, and snacks, but each evening all residents will convene for a group dinner.</blockquote>
