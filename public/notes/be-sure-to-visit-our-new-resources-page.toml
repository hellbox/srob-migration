Last night [at Ignite Seattle](http://igniteseattle.com/2015/08/21/full-speaker-list-and-tickets-for-seattle-ignite-28/), I officially announced the *Seattle Review of Books*'s newest feature: [the Resources page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/resources/). On this page, you'll find dozens of ways to get involved with Seattle's literary community: literary magazines, open mic nights, literary news sources, book clubs, literary happy hours, places to volunteer, places to take classes. If you're new to town or you're just looking to get a little more serious about your commitment to literature, you'll find all sorts of ways to join the literary scene. (And if you're part of a resource that you want our readers to know about, [please contact us](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/). We'll be happy to add you to the page.)

Seattle is right now the most exciting literary city in America, and there are so many ways to participate, as a reader or a writer or someone who just arrived in Seattle, or just as someone who likes to be around people who like books. Whoever you are, [the Resource page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/resources/) is for you.
