Australian author Peter Carey is a world-class talent, and I&rsquo;m not just saying that because he&rsquo;s won a shelf full of awards. A Carey novel is always an intensely readable thing, and he&rsquo;s the rare kind of talent that doesn&rsquo;t preen or showboat. He&rsquo;s just interested in expending exactly the right amount of effort for every one of his books. His latest novel takes place during a car race around Australia in the 1950s, and it explores Aboriginal identity.
