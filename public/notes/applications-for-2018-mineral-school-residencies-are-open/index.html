It&rsquo;s time! The application period for 2018 residencies at the Mineral School is open. You&rsquo;ve only got until February 15, 2018, to <a href="https://mineralschool.submittable.com/submit">put your name in the hat</a> — and we recommend that you do. Mineral School is impossibly cool, a reformed elementary school in a <a href="http://mineral-school.org/location-and-history/">quirky small town</a> near Mt. Rainier. It attracts great writers and artists, some of whom we&rsquo;re proud to have published on the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> (like <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/11/24/novembers-post-it-note-art-from-instagram/">Clare Johnson</a> and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/drawn-from-felt/">Kelly Froh</a>). And it&rsquo;s two weeks of focused time to work, let your brain re-shape to the mountain and the lake, and be fed by someone who knows their way around a kitchen.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re delighted to have Mineral School back as a sponsor, though jealous, as always, of the people who&rsquo;ll actually take those residency slots. Check out our sponsorship page for <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorship">details on the 2018 program</a>, and get a sneak peek at what what Mineral School alumni are publishing next year.</p>

<p>Sponsors like the Mineral School make the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> possible. Did you know <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/">you could sponsor us, as well</a>? If you have a book, event, or opportunity you’d like to get in front of our readers, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">reserve your dates now</a>.</p>
