<p>Remember when <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/29/mein-kampf-returns-to-germany/">I told you</a> that <em>Mein Kampf</em> was about to be published in Germany again for the first time since World War II? Yeah, it <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/328494-mein-kampf-germany-sale/">sold out</a> in less than a week. This is not the ending to this story that I was hoping for.</p>

<p>(Vaguely related: one time back in my bookselling days, a customer tried to return a copy of <em>Mein Kampf</em> because it was an &ldquo;inferior text.&rdquo; He was upset that the introduction was written by a Jewish person. I just stared at him for a bit and then walked away.)</p>
