Our superstar Portrait Gallery artist, [Christine Marie Larsen](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/christine-marie-larsen/), is traveling this week, so there's no new painting today. Instead, please peruse [the 72 portraits in our archives](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/portrait-gallery/).
