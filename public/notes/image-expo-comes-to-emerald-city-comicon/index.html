<p>This is big news: independent comics publisher Image Comics — home of some of the best ongoing comics series in America today including <em>Saga</em>, <em>The Walking Dead</em>, and <em>Bitch Planet</em> — just announced that they&rsquo;re going to host Image Expo, their new-title showcase, at Emerald City Comicon this year. This is the first time they&rsquo;ve partnered with a pre-existing convention for the Expo, and it&rsquo;s also the first time the Expo will take place in Seattle. <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/02/17/image-expo-to-take-place-at-eccc-on-wednesday-april-6th/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BleedingCool+%28Bleeding+Cool+Comic+News+%26+Rumors%29">Bleeding Cool reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>They’ve allied themselves with ReedPOP to be part of the Emerald City Comicon this year in Seattle on **Wednesday, April 6th, from 10 am to 6 pm at the Showbox Market theater**... They’ve already announced  Leila del Duca, Joe Harris, Rick Remender, Alison Sampson  and Jonathan Hickman with more to come and they always have surprises they roll out on the day.</blockquote>

<p>This is a significant nerd coup for Seattle. And it&rsquo;s followed by a spring formal dance, apparently, which sounds kinda incredible. Tickets are <a href="https://www.showclix.com/event/ImageEXPO16">available now</a>.</p>
