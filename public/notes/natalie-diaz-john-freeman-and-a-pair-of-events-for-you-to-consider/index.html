<p>Yesterday, I told you that Arizona poet Natalie Diaz is in town for <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/12/04/literary-event-of-the-week-poetry-across-the-nations-an-indigenous-reading/">a fantastic new series of events celebrating indigenous women writers</a> called Poetry Across the Nations.</p>

<p>What I failed to tell you was that Diaz&rsquo;s first Seattle event this week is <a href="https://www.spl.org/about-the-library/library-news-releases/natalie-diaz-and-john-freeman-1017">tonight at the downtown branch of the Seattle Public Library</a>. She&rsquo;ll be appearing in conversation with great literary editor John Freeman in a discussion about inequality and invisibilty in modern America. I interviewed Freeman a couple years ago, and I can tell you that he gives brilliant, thoughtful answers. I bet he and Diaz will have one hell of a fascinating conversation.</p>

<p>And while we&rsquo;re talking about Freeman, I hope you&rsquo;ll <a href="https://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/reading-through-it-tales-two-americas">join me tomorrow night at 7 pm at Third Place Books Seward Park</a> for the final Reading Through It book club of 2017. We&rsquo;ll be discussing Freeman&rsquo;s anthology <em>Tales of Two Americas: Stories of Inequality in a Divided Nation</em>. It&rsquo;s a book that covers a lot of ground, from poverty to immigration to racism to homelessness. Basically, it&rsquo;s an opportunity to discuss any problem in America today, through the eyes of some of the sharpest writers of our time. Even if you haven&rsquo;t read the whole book, I hope you&rsquo;ll come out and join the book club tomorrow night. It&rsquo;s absolutely free, and the conversation will be hot and heavy.</p>
