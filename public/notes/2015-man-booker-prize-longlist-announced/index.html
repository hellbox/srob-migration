<p>The Man Booker Prize <a href="http://www.themanbookerprize.com/news/man-booker-prize-announces-2015-longlist">announced their longlist this morning</a>. The criteria changed last year to be open to international authors writing in English; up until last year, it was solely a prize for writers from the UK commonwealth, Ireland, and Zimbabwe. The longlist is:</p>

<p>Bill Clegg (US) - <em>Did You Ever Have a Family</em></p>

<p>Anne Enright (Ireland) - <em>The Green Road</em></p>

<p>Marlon James (Jamaica) - <em>A Brief History of Seven Killings</em></p>

<p>Laila Lalami (US) - <em>The Moor&rsquo;s Account</em></p>

<p>Tom McCarthy (UK) - <em>Satin Island</em></p>

<p>Chigozie Obioma (Nigeria) - <em>The Fishermen</em></p>

<p>Andrew Oâ€™Hagan (UK) - <em>The Illuminations</em></p>

<p>Marilynne Robinson (US) - <em>Lila</em></p>

<p>Anuradha Roy (India) - <em>Sleeping on Jupiter</em></p>

<p>Sunjeev Sahota (UK) - <em>The Year of the Runaways</em></p>

<p>Anna Smaill (New Zealand) - <em>The Chimes</em></p>

<p>Anne Tyler (US) - <em>A Spool of Blue Thread</em></p>

<p>Hanya Yanagihara (US) - <em>A Little Life</em></p>

<p>The shortlist of six authors will be announced on September 15th, and the winner will be announced on October 13th.</p>

<p>Literary awards are fun, silly things. They don&rsquo;t make a book any better or worse, but they do generally help get books in the hands of more readers, which is always a good thing. The <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> is rooting for Laila Lalami.</p>
