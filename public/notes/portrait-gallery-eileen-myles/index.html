<p>Everybody&rsquo;s <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/sorry-eileen-myles/">talking about Eileen Myles</a> this week! That&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;ll be reading at <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/eileen-myles">Elliott Bay Book Company on Saturday</a>. You should go see her. Until then, here she is with her dog, Honey.</p>
