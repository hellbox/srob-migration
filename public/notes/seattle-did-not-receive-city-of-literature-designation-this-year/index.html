<p>UNESCO just released <a href="http://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/events/47-cities-join-unesco-creative-cities-network">their full list of new members of the Creative Cities Network</a>. Seattle, which was making its second bid to become a City of Literature, is <strong>not on that list</strong>. UNESCO does not make its deliberations public, but it&rsquo;s <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/picking-wires-from-a-bowl-of-noodles/">not hard to come up</a> with reasons why <a href="http://seattlish.com/post/113982681386/ryan-boudinot-killed-seattle-city-of-lit-and-the">we might not have made the list this year</a>.</p>

<p>The sad thing is, after the unpleasantness of the spring passed, our City of Literature organization found <strong>a terrific, capable leader in Bob Redmond</strong>. Redmond is a tireless advocate for the arts in this city, and it was great to have him repping for our (truly world-class) literary scene. The reason a Creative Cities designation would be so great for Seattle is that it would direct the city to create an office devoted specifically to Seattle&rsquo;s literary scene, both to promote the resources we have and to cultivate those resources in partnership with other cities in UNESCO&rsquo;s Creative Cities Network.</p>

<p>The current City of Lit organization is getting together to discuss the future of the bid early next year. I believe that with Redmond&rsquo;s leadership and a board that doesn&rsquo;t have to suffer through continual unnecessary distractions and drama, we could earn that bid in 2016. But for now, let&rsquo;s congratulate <a href="http://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/events/47-cities-join-unesco-creative-cities-network">this year&rsquo;s new Cities of Literature</a>:</p>
