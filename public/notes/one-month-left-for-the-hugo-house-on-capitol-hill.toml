Hugo House has published a [(PDF) Frequently Asked Questions](https://hugohouse.org/wp-content/uploads/hugo/2016/04/Moving-FAQ.pdf) sheet explaining what their last month of operations in the Capitol Hill building will be like. There will be a large party on May 7th in which people will be invited to write on the walls of the House, and there will be a Literary Series event on the 20th — the theme is "The Writing on the Wall," cleverly enough — that is slated to be the final event. If you'd like to learn about what the Hugo House will look like on First Hill, please [check out the FAQ](https://hugohouse.org/wp-content/uploads/hugo/2016/04/Moving-FAQ.pdf). They're doing a good job of being very transparent about this.
