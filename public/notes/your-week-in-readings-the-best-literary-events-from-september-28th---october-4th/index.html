Jansz and Qazi both came to US after facing censorship abroad, only to find new threats here. <em>Hugo House, 1021 Columbia St., 322-7030, <a href="http://hugohouse.org">http://hugohouse.org</a>.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Sunday October 2nd: Seattle Writes</strong></h5></p>
Once when I worked in a bookstore, a customer asked me to help him find a book he’d heard about on NPR. He explained that in the book, “a man meets another man, and there’s a conflict.” Seattle novelist Karen Finneyfrock’s latest writing class is all about how every book has conflict at its heart.<em>Delridge Library,5423 Delridge Way SW., 733-9125, <a href="http://spl.org">http://spl.org</a>.

<p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Monday October 3rd: <em>M Train</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Everyone is currently losing their mind over Bruce Springsteen’s new memoir, but if you’re gaga over The Boss and you haven’t read Patti Smith&rsquo;s second memoir, <em>M Train</em>, you’re missing out.

Beat that, Bruce. <em>University Temple Methodist Church, 1415 NE 43rd St, 634-3400-4255, <a href="http://ubookstore.com">http://ubookstore.com</a>. $17.54. All ages. 7 p.m. </em></p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Tuesday October 4th: <em>Citizen Scientist</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Mary Ellen Hannibal is not a scientist — by which I mean she did not spend the better part of a decade honing her scientific understanding in a university program. But her new book extols the joys of citizen science: observing the world, researching what happens, and reporting what you see.
