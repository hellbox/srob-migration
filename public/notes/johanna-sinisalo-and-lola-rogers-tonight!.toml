If you have gone, or can't go, to [our recommended reading in Bellevue today](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/19/your-week-in-readings-the-best-events-from-october-19th-to-26th/), come tonight and see Johanna Sinisalo at Elliott Bay Bookstore! She'll be introduced by Lola Rogers, who just wrote about [Sinisalo for us earlier this week](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/that-is-so-weird/). 

Sinisalo is truly remarkable &mdash; a writer of the strange and wonderful. Modern spec fic fans will love her work, and her travelling to Seattle from her home in Finland is a rare occasion worth celebrating. Hope to see you tonight!
