<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday August 16th: *Why Poetry* Reading**</h5></p> 
Matthew Zapruder isn’t a Seattle poet, but he edits for Seattle-based Wave Books and he publishes with Port Townsend-based Copper Canyon Press. His newest book is a self-described “impassioned call for a return to reading poetry” titled *Why Poetry*. While generally demands that people should read poetry are like telling kids to eat broccoli, Zapruder is a brainy and passionate advocate.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Thursday August 17th: <em>Darkansas</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Seattle writer Jarret Middleton’s first novel, <em>An Dantomine Eerly</em>, was a surrealistic book about the death of a poet. His second, <em>Darkansas</em>, is about a country singer who comes home to the Ozarks to attend his twin brother’s wedding. Meanwhile, his father’s ghost lingers over the proceedings and things get really creepy.

Everyone’s favorite interlocutor, Seattle’s own Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore, interviews journalist Anne-Christine d’Adesky about her memoir of lesbian activism and global refugees.
