Yesterday, [I told you about](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/24/dont-forget-to-celebrate-small-business-saturday/) some local independent bookstores that you should visit on Small Business Saturday. But that doesn't mean you can't buy books online, too! Below are three big sales from independent publishers just in time for Thanksgiving-weekend consumer madness. Buying directly from these publishers will help pay for more great new books in the coming year.

* On Monday, Seattle publisher [Fantagraphics Books](http://fantagraphics.com/flog/cybermonday/) is having a 40% off sale on everything.

* Excellent Canadian publisher [Drawn & Quarterly](https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/blog/2015/11/dq-having-our-annual-sale-all-week-long) will have comics for sale for 40% off all weekend long.

* And on Friday independent publisher [Melville House](http://www.mhpbooks.com/books/) is throwing [a 40% off sale](https://twitter.com/melvillehouse/status/669542758785425408?lang=en) on all books and gifts, too.

If you're looking for some recommendations, you can't go wrong with [*Hip Hop Family Tree*](http://www.fantagraphics.com/hiphopbox1/) for the music-lover in your life, the [Complete Peanuts](http://www.fantagraphics.com/series/peanuts/) for virtually anyone, or this gorgeous edition of [*The Eternaut*](http://www.fantagraphics.com/eternaut/) for the comics fan on your list from Fantagraphics. Drawn & Quarterly publishes beautiful reprints of [the Moomin series](https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/who-will-comfort-toffle) for all ages, [*Blankets* by Craig Thompson](https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/shop?section=new_releases&book=blankets) for that special someone, and the hilarious Lisa Hanwalt's [*My Dirty Dumb Eyes*](https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/my-dirty-dumb-eyes) for fans of the Hanawalt-designed show *Bojack Horseman*. If you're looking for gifts from Melville House, you should consider the [Neversink Library  ](http://www.mhpbooks.com/series/the-neversink-library/) for the literary purist, the [Art of the Novella series](http://www.mhpbooks.com/series/the-art-of-the-novella/) for people who want to read more quality fiction in the coming year, and Andrey Kurkov's [*Death and the Penguin*](http://www.mhpbooks.com/books/death-and-the-penguin/) for just about anyone who loves a great novel.
