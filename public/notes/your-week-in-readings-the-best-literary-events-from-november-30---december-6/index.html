<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday November 30th: *My Old Man and the Mountain* Reading
**</h5></p> 

<p>The youngest son of “Big Jim” Whittaker, the first American to climb Mount Everest, is also a mountain climber. Maybe Leif Whittaker can explain what the deal is with his bizarre family business — everybody knows the punchline “because it’s there,” but what really makes two generations of a family decide to climb mountains? <em>Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, <a href="http://elliottbaybook.com ">http://elliottbaybook.com </a>.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday December 1st: *Moonglow* Reading**</h5></p> 

<p>Michael Chabon’s latest novel combines rocket science, deathbed confessions, and family secrets into one memoirish novel. Ostensibly a story about Chabon’s dying grandfather, <em>Moonglow</em> is quieter and more direct than some of his other novels, and its realism and relatively simple sentences might open Chabon up to a new audience. *Seattle Public Library, 1000 4th Ave., 386-4636, <a href="http://spl.org">http://spl.org</a>.
