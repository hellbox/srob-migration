<p>While I&rsquo;m not going to shed a tear for <em>Details</em> — I haven&rsquo;t read a copy in at least a decade — this is <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/conde-nast-to-shutter-details-magazine-1447869601">not good news for writers</a>. It&rsquo;s hard out there for freelancers, and only getting harder. Combine this with news that <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2015/11/accounts-disabled">Gawker laid off writers yesterday</a> in their ill-advised attempt to rebrand as a politics site and you&rsquo;ve got another step forward in the consolidation of an already-rough market.</p>
