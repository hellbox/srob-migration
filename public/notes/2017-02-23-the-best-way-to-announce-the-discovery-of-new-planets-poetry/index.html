        <p>Like everyone else, you probably grew a little bit misty at the news that NASA discovered seven Earth-sized planets some 40 light years away from us. It&rsquo;s wondrous news, by which I mean it inspires wonder in us.</p>

<p>But one of the neater and under-covered aspects of this revelation is that astronomer Sean Raymond, one of the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7642/full/nature21360.html">co-authors of the report about the planets</a>, announced the discovery with a long poem. You can find the poem, &ldquo;Ode to 7 Orbs,&rdquo; <a href="https://planetplanet.net/2017/02/22/trappist1-poem/">on Raymond&rsquo;s site</a>. A sampling:</p>

<blockquote><p class="noindent">This new star with planets is called TRAPPIST-1</p>
<p class="noindent">It’s not a star that is at all like the Sun</p>
<p class="noindent">It’s much much much smaller, and also less hot</p>
<p class="noindent">Two thousand times fainter. (Now that is a lot).</p>
<p class="noindent">An “ultracool dwarf” star they call it. And hey,</p>
<p class="noindent">It’s just about 40-odd light years away.</p>
<p class="noindent"></p>
<p class="noindent">The planets have letters for names. Now, you see,</p>
<p class="noindent">From outside to in it’s h, g, f, e, d,</p>
<p class="noindent">And, yes, as you guessed, after that, c and b</p>
<p class="noindent">(The first one’s called b. There is no planet a.</p>
<p class="noindent">The “a” is reserved for the star, by the way).</p></blockquote>

<p>Okay, look: it&rsquo;s not great poetry. But it is absolutely adorable that a scientist is so excited about a discovery the he decided to celebrate it with an epic explanatory poem. The sheer exuberance of it is deeply moving.</p>
