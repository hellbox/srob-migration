<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Sunday, November 19th:  An Evening with David Sedaris</strong></h5></p>
Okay, look: David Sedaris tickets aren’t cheap, it’s true. They’re even less cheap now that most of the cheap seats have sold out for his Benaroya Hall appearance. But Sedaris is one of the only authors in the world who is continually worth it. He’s funny, he’s quick-witted, he loves performing his work for a room full of humans. You won’t regret the investment into this one.
