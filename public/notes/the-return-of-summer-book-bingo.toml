Last year, the Seattle Public Library and Seattle Arts and Lectures teamed up to promote a popular Summer Book Bingo program. It was such a success — my social media was at times overwhelmed with #BookBingoNW hashtags — that they're doing it again. [This year's PDF bingo card](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fshelftalkblog.files.wordpress.com%2F2016%2F05%2Fbookbingo_04c.pdf) includes categories like "Local author," "#WeNeedDiverseBooks," and "Recommended by a librarian." If you black out the whole card, you'll be entered to win a library of books from Seattle Arts and Lectures along with tickets to the 2016-2017 season. If you do a standard bingo column, you'll be entered to win a $30 gift certificate at a local independent bookseller. The deadline is Tuesday, September 6th.
