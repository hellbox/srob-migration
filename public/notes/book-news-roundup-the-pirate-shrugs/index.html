<li><p>Congratulations are due to Chris Higashi, the director of the Washington Center for the Book. <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/we-are-all-completely-beside-ourselves-is-new-seattle-reads-book/">Mary Ann Gwinn at the <em>Seattle Times</em> reports</a> that Higashi is receiving this year&rsquo;s Sherry Prowda Literary Champion Award, which is a prize celebrating a person who champions the Seattle literary community. Higashi is a powerhouse who curates the library&rsquo;s reading series and many of the library&rsquo;s wonderful literacy programs. She is exactly the kind of person the library should be emulating; let&rsquo;s hope this award underlines that fact.</p></li>

Why is that? <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/02/22/why-comic-piracy-suffered-a-temporary-setback-last-week/">Bleeding Cool explains</a> that the one British person who uploads the vast majority of all pirated scans of comics â€” was busy &ldquo;moving house. &ldquo;Nemesis43 has become so ubiquitous in the comic book pirating scene that everyone else has, basically, stopped,&rdquo; Bleeding Cool reports.</p></li>
