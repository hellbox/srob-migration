        <p>Every so often I&rsquo;ll read a corporate superhero comic that reminds me why I fell in love with the genre as a child. This week&rsquo;s <em>U.S.Avengers</em> #4 is that kind of a book.</p>

<p>Writer Al Ewing has been pubilshing fun superhero comics for Marvel for a while — his <em>Ultimates</em> has basically grown into a hall-of-fame of the weirdest ideas Marvel writers have ever produced — but his <em>U.S.Avengers</em> series is the best thing he&rsquo;s done yet. Starring the most half-baked collection of superheroes you can imagine — Squirrel Girl, an off-brand Hulk, a pacifist Iron Man — and illustrated with great sincerity by Paco Medina, the book feels like a parody that spins out of control, only to circle all the way back around to become a straightforward adventure comic again.</p>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1489640872024/usavengers.jpg)</p>

<p>Every issue of <em>U.S.Avengers</em> has been a standalone story that, in any other series, would be blown out to six stultifying issues. But the most recent issue takes that concept literally: It&rsquo;s an entire four-issue corporate superhero comic crossover crammed into a single, normal-sized issue. And I mean that literally: every few pages, Medina draws another cover to a nonexistent series (&ldquo;Monsters &lsquo;n Shield&rdquo; is one) followed by another splash page with credits. The comic is made up of four tiny comics.</p>

<p>Medina&rsquo;s art is fantastic for this sort of thing. He perfectly captures the man-in-tights aesthetic, but his work is just cartoony enough to lend a slight satirical bent.</p>

<p>The story involves two characters I loathe — Deadpool and Red Hulk, who is like the regular Hulk only red, and an asshole — trying to fight a monster-making mad scientist. Ewing gets credit for writing the only Deadpool line that has ever made me laugh out loud (and yes, I&rsquo;m including the wildly overrated Ryan Reynolds movie in this estimation.) It&rsquo;s a ridiculous book starring ridiculous characters who know how ridiculous they are, which is all most of us ask from our superhero comics.</p>

<p>In a time when most monthly corporate comics are overridden with crossovers and bloated stories designed to pad out trade paperbacks, <em>U.S.Avengers #4</em> openly mocks both those conventions. Maybe mainstream comics have lowered my expectations too much, but right now that&rsquo;s enough to win my heart.</p>
