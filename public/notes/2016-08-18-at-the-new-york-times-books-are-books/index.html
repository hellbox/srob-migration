        <p>M.A.Orthofer <a href="http://www.complete-review.com/saloon/archive/201608b.htm#wu1">at the Literary Saloon</a> notes that the <em>New York Times</em> has consolidated all of its book review coverage — in the daily paper and in the <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> — under the purview of Pamela Paul. It&rsquo;s perhaps easy to bemoan every new change in the world of journalism as a mistake, but, uh, I think this is a mistake.</p>

<p>One of the consistent pleasures of reading the <em>New York Times</em> was finding book reviews in the paper that disagreed with book reviews in the <em>Book Review</em>. I used to love those intercenine moments when the institution disagreed with itself; to me, they highlighted one of the most important parts of reviewing: the fact that every review is subjective, and that it&rsquo;s possible for even employees of a single august institution to have differing opinions on a work of art. Now that the book reviews are all under one set of watchful eyes, I bet those moments of dissonance will never happen again, which is a real pity.</p>
