<p class="noindent">Our inspiring sponsor, Susan Marie Conrad, did something many of us want to do, but almost nobody does: she kayaked the entire Inside Passage, from Anacortes to Juneau, Alaska. You and I both know this story is more than just the logistics of paddling, and Conrad delivers a great story in her book _Inside: One Womanâ€™s Journey Though the Inside Passage_. It's well-told, rife with personal accomplishment, and that kind of self-examination that only comes from pitting oneself against nature.</p>
