Exciting! Some 90 middle-schoolers join in M-O-R-T-A-L C-O-M-B-A-T to determine who is the best speller in the region. The winner will go on to face the best spellers in the country. I took part in a spelling bee in elementary school; I went on to regionals and then I lost because I spelled &ldquo;VENEER&rdquo; &ldquo;V-E-N-I-E-R.&rdquo; I guarantee that several of these kids are going to remember the words they lost on for the rest of their lives, too.
