<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday, January 18: *Her Body and Other Parties* Reading**</h5></p>
<p class="noindent">
Author Carmen Maria Machado reads from her celebrated debut collection of short stories, *Her Body and Other Parties*. It’s a book that crosses lines from sci-fi to horror to thriller to odd Law & Order: Special Victims Unit parodies. <br />*Seattle Public Library, 1000 4th Ave., 386-4636, http://spl.org, 7 pm, free.*</p>
