<p>In <a href="http://seattlemysteryblog.typepad.com/seattle_mystery/2017/09/why-the-seattle-mystery-bookshop-must-close.html">a long and thoughtful post</a>, Seattle Mystery Bookshop owner JB Dickey explains why he&rsquo;s closing his bookstore at the end of this month. I&rsquo;m sad the bookshop couldn&rsquo;t find a new owner, but I&rsquo;m glad that Seattle had so many wonderful years with such a wonderful bookstore.</p>
