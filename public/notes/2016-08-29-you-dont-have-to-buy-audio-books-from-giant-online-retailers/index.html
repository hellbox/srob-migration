        <p>If you&rsquo;re at all like me, you&rsquo;ve stood in a record store and felt a sick pang in your gut as you realized that you don&rsquo;t own a CD player anymore.  Somehow — I blame hypnosis — computer manufacturers tricked us into giving up physical media in exchange for a few millimeters of laptop thinness. We&rsquo;re not buying CDs anymore, we&rsquo;re downloading our audio entertainment. And that goes for audio books, too.</p>

<p>Until recently, your options for buying audio books were limited — you could give your money to an ethically problematic online retailer, or you could buy an enormous brick of multiple CDs at your local independent bookseller.</p>

<p>Happily, a local business has been selling audio books online, and they&rsquo;ve recently started partnering with independent booksellers, so you can buy your audio books directly from your favorite local bookstore. <a href="https://libro.fm/about">Libro.fm</a> is an independent online audio book retailer that sells their audio books through an online portal and from apps. You can download the books as DRM-free mp3 audio files.</p>

<p>Best of all, though, are the independent bookstore storefronts created in partnership with Libro.fm, which have <a href="https://libro.fm/playlists/pb-bestsellers-year-two">personalized staff recommendations</a> to help you choose your next audio book. Here are the local stores you can buy audio books from through Libro.fm:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://libro.fm/eagleharborbooks">Eagle Harbor Books</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://libro.fm/elliottbaybook">Elliott Bay Book Company</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://libro.fm/phinneybooks">Phinney Books</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://libro.fm/thirdplacebooks">Third Place Books</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://libro.fm/ubookstore">University Book Store</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try the service out, this month Libro is <a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/3938559381926-the-boys-in-the-boat-43-minute-excerpt">offering a free 43-minute excerpt of <em>The Boys in the Boat</em></a>, the hugely popular story of the 1936 University of Washington rowing team&rsquo;s Olympic quest. Maybe give it a shot, and see if ethically sound, independently purchased audio books are right for you?</p>
