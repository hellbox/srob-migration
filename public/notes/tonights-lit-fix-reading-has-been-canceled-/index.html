<p>We just received an email from host Mia Lipman that says due to a last-minute emergency, tonight&rsquo;s Lit Fix reading, which <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/03/22/literary-event-of-the-week-lit-fix-fourth-anniversary-party-at-chop-suey/">I wrote about this morning</a>, has been canceled. Apologies to everyone.</p>
