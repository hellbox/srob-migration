<p>Judge Neil Gorsuch, in his Supreme Court nomination hearings today, <a href="http://blog.acton.org/archives/92657-judge-gorsuch-the-rule-of-law-and-david-foster-wallaces-fish.html">quoted David Foster Wallace&rsquo;s most famous commencement speech</a> to explain the ubiquity of law. (It&rsquo;s kind of a dumb and basic interpretation of the speech, if you ask me, but whatever.) Justice Antonin Scalia was <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/scalia-likes-david-foster-wallace-2012-11">also a DFW fan</a>. What&rsquo;s the connection between conservative judges and the work of David Foster Wallace? It must the tennis, right? Yeah, it&rsquo;s gotta be the tennis.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Oh my God. Is nothing sacred?</p>
