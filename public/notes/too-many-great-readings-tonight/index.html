<p>As we&rsquo;ve mentioned, tonight is the very last Cheap Wine &amp; Poetry event at the Hugo House. This is our pick for the best event of the evening; CW&amp;P is a consistently great event, and this is its last time on the Hugo House stage before the House is demolished later this year. Further, the future of CW&amp;P — and the answer to the question of whether CW&amp;P even <em>has</em> a future — has not yet been announced. It&rsquo;s a milestone!</p>

<p>But I wanted to tell you about two other great events happening tonight, because it is an unusually jam-packed Thursday night in literary Seattle.

<li><p>At Elliott Bay Book Company, Danielle Dutton, Tara Atkinson, and Jane Wong will read at 7 pm. Atkinson is a co-founder of the APRIL Festival and she writes excellent short fiction. Wong is one of Seattle&rsquo;s best poets. We&rsquo;ve published <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/13/spoiled/">two of her poems</a> here at <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/29/apology-in-the-age-of-construction/">the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em></a>. And Dutton is the publisher of Dorothy, an indpendent press that publishes great women writers. She&rsquo;s also the author of <em>Margaret the First</em>, a novel about a writer in 17th century England, when women were basically not allowed to be writers. This looks like it&rsquo;ll be a spectacular evening.</p></li>

<li><p>And at <a href="http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/poetry-april-natasha-moni-erin-malone-and-michael-schmeltzer">Third Place Books Ravenna</a>, three Seattle poets are reading: Natasha Moni, author of <em>The Cardiologist&rsquo;s Daughter</em>; Erin Malone, author of <em>Hover</em>; and Michael Schmeltzer, author of <em>Elegy/Elk River</em> and <em>Blood Song</em>. (Malone <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/17/time-capsule/">published a great poem titled &ldquo;Time Capsule&rdquo;</a> here at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> a few months ago.) This is a high-quality lineup of wonderful Seattle poets celebrating National Poetry Month in one of our most charming neighborhood bookstores. What&rsquo;s not to love?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Every week, I go through all the upcoming events to find one literary event per evening to recommend to readers of the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>. Most nights, I have to decide between at least two cool-looking events. Tonight, there were three. Which one are you going to? Choose wisely.</p>
