<p>Over at <a href="http://theatricalmustang.podbean.com/e/paul-constant/">the Theatrical Mustang podcast</a>, I talked about the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> with host Katie Woodzick. We also discussed diversity, why Seattle is such an amazing city for books, and the pleasure of not discussing Jonathan Franzen. I hope you&rsquo;ll give it a listen and then subscribe to Theatrical Mustang, which interviews all sorts of literary, theater, and musical types. Start with <a href="http://theatricalmustang.podbean.com/e/kathy-hsieh/">this interview with the wonderful Kathy Hsieh</a>.</p>
