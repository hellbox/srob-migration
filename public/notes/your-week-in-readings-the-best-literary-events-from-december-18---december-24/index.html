<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday, December 19: Computer Science Book Club**</h5></p>
Ada’s Technical Books hosts a monthly Computer Science Book Club intended for people with and without computer science experience. This month’s selection is *How to Do Things with Videogames*, a book about “the limitless possibilities offered by [videogames’] ability to create complex simulated realities.” Sounds like this could be a good discussion about the theory and possibilities of videogames.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Thursday, December 21: Literary Translator Feedback Forum</strong></h5></p>
The Northwest Translators and Interpreters Society continues its partnership with the downtown private library Folio with a Feedback forum. According to press materials, “Translators working on poetry or prose from three different languages will share their works in progress and accept helpful feedback and questions from attendees.” If you, like me, are fascinated by the fact that it’s virtually impossible to create anything resembling a truly 100% accurate translation, you’ll likely find a lot to think about at this event.
