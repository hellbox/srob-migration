<p>Polygon tufts<br>
kitely incurved<br>
hood the fir cones from<br>
rainfall. They respond<br>
by closing tight<br>
like the armadillo married the ent<br>
and gave birth to<br>
convex reflections of skylight<br>
bursting chrome.<br>
No slither for the deluge<br>
the fir cones may now ripen<br>
a living piece of architecture.<br>
And when the branches shed,<br>
the needles burn in captivity,<br>
in ceremony,<br>
to bless and protect<br>
continuum.</p>
