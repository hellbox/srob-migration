Is it okay to read erotica on public transit? Cienna can help. Send your questions to</em> advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>In your opinion, what movie adaptation is better than the book it’s based on and why?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Caroline, Matthews Beach</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Caroline,</p>

<p class="noindent">I'm currently loving *Black Sails*, which is not a movie but a pirate-themed series based on historical figures and characters from the children's book *Treasure Island*. It inspired me to re-read *Treasure Island*, however, I abandoned it after a few chapters because there was not enough fucking.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>

<p class="noindent">P.S. I just asked a woman on the bus your question and she said "*50 Shades of Grey*." Just in case you wanted two terrible opinions.</p>

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Bonus Question!**</h5></p> 

<p class="noindent"><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>I read romance novels on my Kindle on the bus. Nobody needs to know what I'm into, right? But then, every now and again on my commute I’ll run into a coworker who wants to make small talk about what I’m reading. I'm terrible at lying. Can you give me some good snappy comebacks?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Dahlia, Lower Queen Anne</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Dahlia,</p>

<p class="noindent">Tell your coworkers that you are reading "erotic C-SPAN fanfic," "Bible limericks" or "fresh pet obituaries." Those are three collections of words that no one wants to hear slide out of a coworker's mouth. But if you're not as comfortable making people uncomfortable as I am, you can also say, "I don't know. I'm not really reading it, this Kindle is just a prop to discourage bus folk from making small talk with me." And then smile real nice.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
