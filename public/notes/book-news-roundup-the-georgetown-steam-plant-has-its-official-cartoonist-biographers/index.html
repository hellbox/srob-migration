<li><p>In the midst of <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/10/31/seattle-designated-a-unesco-city-of-literature-the-world-is-looking-at-seattle-as-a-cultural-leader/">all the exciting City of Literature news yesterday</a>, this piece of news didn&rsquo;t get the attention it deserves: <a href="http://artbeat.seattle.gov/2017/10/31/historic-georgetown-steam-plant-powers-graphic-novel/">David Lasky and Mairead Case have been selected</a> to create a fictionalized graphic novel about the beautiful old Georgetown Steam Plant. (We <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/06/06/book-news-roundup-want-50000-dollars-to-make-a-graphic-novel/">told you about the open call for Seattle cartoonists</a> five months ago.) Case and Lasky will be blogging about the experience of creating the graphic novel on the new site <a href="http://steamplantgraphicnovel.com/">Steam Plant Graphic Novel: The Blog!</a> Bookmark that site, now; it should be an interesting look into the research and process of two of Seattle&rsquo;s finest cartooning talents.</p></li>

<li><p>If the blog is interesting enough, I hope someone adapts it into a theatrical experience called &ldquo;Steam Plant Graphic Novel: The Blog!: The Musical!&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Also in the midst of yesterday&rsquo;s UNESCO hullabaloo — UNESCOBALOO? — <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/10/31/poetry-northwest-launches-the-joan-swift-memorial-prize-for-women-poets-over-the-age-of-65/">Martin McClellan wrote a piece on this site announcing an amazing new literary award</a> for women poets over the age of 65. The prize, sponsored by <em>Poetry Northwest</em>, honors the life and legacy of brilliant Seattle poet Jane Swift.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=third%20place%20books%20pramila">Congressperson Pramila Jayapal is now choosing monthly book club picks at Third Place Books!</a> Her first selection is Claudia Rankine&rsquo;s excellent <em>Citizen</em>, which <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/a-room-full-of-citizens/">I reviewed back in January</a> after we discussed it for the Reading Through It Book Club. This is a great way for an elected official to stay in touch with her district.</p></li>

<li><p><em>SRoB</em> tipper <strong>Levi</strong> points out <a href="http://deadline.com/2017/10/nonplayer-movie-legendary-entertainment-eric-pearson-writing-thor-ragnarok-1202195649/">the news that the movie rights to un-prolific Seattle cartoonist Nate Simpson&rsquo;s comic <em>Nonplayer</em> has been bought by Legendary Entertainment</a>. The first issue of <em>Nonplayer</em> came out in 2011, and the second issue came out in 2015. Just because the movie rights have sold don&rsquo;t mean an actual movie will be made, but the odds are pretty good that a movie version will come out before the fourth issue of <em>Nonplayer</em> hits the stands.</p></li>

<li><p>And <em>SRoB</em> tipper <strong>Doug</strong> wants you to see this tribute to literary maestro Harry Mathews, who passed away in January of this year:</p></li>
