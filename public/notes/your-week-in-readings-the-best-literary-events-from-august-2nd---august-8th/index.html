<p><p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday August 2nd: Reading Through It: <em>Evicted</em> **</h5></p>
Join the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> and the <em>Seattle Weekly</em> in the latest of our monthly book discussion series.  This month’s book, the Pulitzer Prizewinning <em>Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City</em>, is the first selection that could possibly evoke absolutely no discussion of President Trump. Come talk about why the rent is so damn high with us!

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Friday August 4th: Science Fiction Songwriting for Teens</strong></h5></p>
This is exactly why we have a public library system: real recording artists will work with Seattle-area teens (that’s age 13 and up) to write and record songs about the sci-fi story of their choice. If you record a sea shanty about <em>Battlefield Earth</em>, please email it to me, okay?

The mystery-themed reading series at Seattle’s swankiest bar continues with a very special episode. Los Angeles writers including Sarah M. Chen, Ashley Erwin, Danny Gardner, and more will do literary battle with Seattle mystery writers including Kat Richardson, Tracy Weber, and Nick Feldman. The home team had better win this one.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Sunday August 6th: Comics Dungeon Sale</strong></h5></p>
Wallingford’s Comics Dungeon recently founded a nonprofit named Comics for Community, Compassion, and Culture, which teaches literacy through comics to kids. That means that if you visit Comics Dungeons’ anniversary sale and buy some $1 comics or discounted trade paperbacks, you won’t just be participating in crass commercialism — you’ll also be helping to teach local kids to read.
