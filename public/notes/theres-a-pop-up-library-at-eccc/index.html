<p>Visiting <a href="http://www.emeraldcitycomicon.com/" title="Emerald City Comicon – March 2 – 5, 2017 - Emerald City Comicon">ECCC</a> over the weekend? Drop by the pop-up library! Located in the <a href="http://www.emeraldcitycomicon.com/Events/Events-R-Z/Writers-Block/">Writer&rsquo;s Block</a>, it&rsquo;s staffed by local librarians &mdash; thirty-five of them from twelve library systems! &mdash; who are there for reading recommendations, and also research advice for content creators. There&rsquo;s a chill area where you can get away from the bustle for a few minutes to check out what they have on their shelves.</p>

<p>And if you&rsquo;re creator, one of the organizers has put out a call for you to come by and be a volunteer for an hour or so. We think you should take her up on it:</p>
