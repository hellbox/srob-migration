<p>Joan Rivers was one of the most fascinating entertainers of the 20th century. Anyone over the age of 30 can probably tell you something about her life — the way Johnny Carson blacklisted her from his show, for instance, or her QVC shopping empire, or her vicious insults of celebrities, or her catchphrase, &ldquo;can we talk?&rdquo; — and every adult under 30 has undoubtedly seen a comedian who was profoundly influenced by Rivers&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>But there are so many acts to Rivers&rsquo; life that it&rsquo;s hard to keep track of them all. She climbed to the top of showbiz and fell to the bottom of the heap so often that her life reads like a gaudy amusement park ride. Nobody else danced so eagerly with fame, or was let down by fame&rsquo;s fickle moods so often. You can get whiplash just reading about one of her falls from grace.</p>

<p>Leslie Bennetts&rsquo;s biography of Rivers, <em>Last Girl Before Freeway: The Life, Loves, Losses, and Liberation of Joan Rivers</em>, provides an eagle-eyed view of Rivers&rsquo;s entire life, and the vistas are breathtaking. Rivers interacted with every major entertainment figure of her time, and she even made an impact outside of the Hollywood bubble: she practically made a career out of mocking first ladies and daughters of presidents. It&rsquo;s a lot to keep track of, and Bennetts does it beautifully.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Bennetts doesn&rsquo;t lose track of Rivers&rsquo;s many contradictions. Rivers built her career like a feminist — she forced her way into a male-dominated field, and she never let those men forget that a woman got more laughs than they did. But she behaved in ways that seemed downright misogynistic: Rivers gloated about the fact that her fortune was built on cruel fat jokes made at Elizabeth Taylor&rsquo;s expense. She continued to mock women throughout her life, including Kristen Stewart, Angelina Jolie, and others.</p>

<p>Bennetts indicates that Rivers was operating from a place of insecurity, a sense that Rivers always wished she was beautiful: &ldquo;Rivers believed that women were meant to get love through the one irreplaceable asset she lacked, and she never got over the unfairness of being sentenced to a life deprived of the power of physical beauty.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a cop-out meant to absolve her of blame: Bennetts doesn&rsquo;t justify Rivers&rsquo;s behavior, she merely observes it.</p>

<p>In the end, Rivers doesn&rsquo;t reconcile her cruelty. Life doesn&rsquo;t work like that. And those contradictions and heartbreaks and triumphs and tragedies make for one of the most entertaining biographies I&rsquo;ve read this year.</p>
