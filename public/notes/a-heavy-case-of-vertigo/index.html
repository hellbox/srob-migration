<p>Speaking of comics, I barely pay attention to the news that comes out of San Diego Comicon these days because it&rsquo;s become a big Hollywood PR machine. But the SDCC news that DC Comics&rsquo; adult/creator-owned imprint Vertigo is <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/07/09/sdcc-15-vertigo-adds-a-dozen-new-titles-for-the-fall-including-lucifer/">launching 12 new titles this fall</a> is very welcome. Vertigo used to publish wonderful comics series on a regular basis, but it&rsquo;s fallen into disrepair over the last decade or so. Some of these names — Darwyn Cooke! Gilbert Hernandez! Mike Allred! Gail Simone! — are very promising, and only one of them (<em>Lucifer</em>) appears to be a half-assed <em>Sandman</em> ripoff. I like those odds.</p>
