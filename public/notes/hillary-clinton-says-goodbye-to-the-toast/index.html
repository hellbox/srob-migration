<p>A couple months ago, feminist humor site <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/05/13/book-news-roundup-a-conversation-about-disability-and-the-arts-is-happening-this-afternoon/">The Toast</a> announced that they were closing down on July 1st. Today, it is July 1st and The Toast is, in fact, closing down. This morning, they ran <a href="http://the-toast.net/2016/07/01/a-note-on-the-toast/">a goodbye post from Hillary Clinton</a>:</p>

<blockquote>I know that today is the final day of The Toast, and I wanted to take a moment to reflect on what this space — and spaces like it — mean for women.</blockquote>

<p>You should <a href="http://the-toast.net/2016/07/01/a-note-on-the-toast/">go read the whole thing</a>. Also, take note of Clinton&rsquo;s author bio:</p>

<blockquote>Hillary Clinton is a former First Lady, senator, and Secretary of State, and is currently running for President. She thinks your hair looks great exactly as it is.</blockquote>
