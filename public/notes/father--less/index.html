<p>My father was de-boned as a child.<br>
The trick was to use a sharp knife,<br>
steady hands and always begin at the neck. <br>
With luck, my grandparents<br>
were able to remove his spine intact.</p>

<p>But all-muscle can’t hold love upright.<br>
You see strength needs something<br>
to settle itself around. Boneless men<br>
can only stay where they are bent to.<br>
My father was made to cut</p>

<p>his own beatings off a tree,<br>
like pentimenti I sometimes see through<br>
his scars, a perfect whole. But you can’t<br>
dream the broken out of a person<br>
no matter how hard you try.</p>
