This week, the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> is sponsored by Lois Farfel Stark — the award-winning filmmaker behind more than forty documentaries and, now, the author of <em>The Telling Image</em>. Stark&rsquo;s new book is an exploration of how humans experience the world through shape: a web, a ladder, a helix. Her vast experience makes a tour de force out of what could easily have been a quiet coffee table book.</p>

<p>We look at the world in a sleepy way, especially through the lens of social media, where images slide past in a blur. Stark&rsquo;s book is like caffeine for the visual center of your brain. Stop by <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">our sponsorship page</a> for a glimpse at the rich images she&rsquo;s captured while traveling the world, and her take on them. Then go for a long walk. Keep your eyes open. See what you see.</p>
