<p>Jack Kirby&rsquo;s <em>Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth</em> was my favorite childhood comic. I didn&rsquo;t know it was a ripoff of the first <em>Planet of the Apes</em> movie at the time I started reading my brother&rsquo;s old issues. In fact, I probably started reading <em>Kamandi</em> a full decade before the first time I saw <em>Planet of the Apes</em>. And while I love the <em>Apes</em> reboot films, I still prefer <em>Kamandi</em>.</p>

<p>The premise of <em>Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth</em> is pretty much right there in the title: on a blasted-out apocalyptic earth — something called The Great Disaster happened an indeterminate amount of time ago — a human boy named Kamandi tries to survive. While <em>Planet of the Apes</em> just featured talking apes, Kirby populated Kamandi&rsquo;s planet with all kinds of talking humanoid animals: apes, yes, but also dogs, tigers, cheetahs, bears, and more.</p>

<p>Kirby packed <em>Kamandi</em> with all sorts of allegories for life in the 1970s — my favorite topical story involved a race of subterranean mole people who worship the Watergate tapes — but it was, primarily, a boy&rsquo;s adventure strip, a postapocalyptic sci-fi Jonny Quest.</p>

<p>Last week, DC Comics published something called the <em>Kamandi Challenge Special</em>, a squarebound sampler of <em>Kamandi</em> comics for $7.99. I&rsquo;ve been waiting years for a nice, affordable sampler of these stories to give to the young comics fans in my life; I think <em>Kamandi</em> has a timeless quality that might appeal to any comics fan.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this isn&rsquo;t the collection to pass on to a new comics fan. Frankly, the selection of comics in this edition is just plain weird. The book starts with a reprint of <em>Kamandi</em> #32, which is smack in the middle of an ongoing story involving a weird space organism that shifts from uni- to multi-cellular and back again. (&ldquo;I am &lsquo;ME.&rsquo; I can be&hellip;WE&hellip;! Now I am&hellip;US&hellip;!&rdquo;) It&rsquo;s a fun ride to be dropped in the middle of — one chapter is titled &ldquo;Satan in the Sands,&rdquo; for crying out loud — but there&rsquo;s no real reason why it should be the story that opens the book.</p>

<p>Especially since the second book collected in the volume is the very first issue of <em>Kamandi</em> — one which introduces characters who we&rsquo;ve already met in the first story. It&rsquo;s just a weird curation decision. And then the rest of the book consists of a black-and-white unpublished post-Kirby <em>Kamandi</em> story written by Jack C. Harris and drawn by Dick Ayers and Danny Bulandi which is itself wrapped around an unpublished Jack Kirby <em>Sandman</em> story that doesn&rsquo;t feature Kamandi at all.</p>

<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re just sitting down to watch a TV show. You&rsquo;ve heard lots of good things about it. You&rsquo;re excited to watch it. But the first episode you watch is from the middle of the second season. Then you watch the pilot. And then you watch a shoddy clip show from a season well after the main actor has already left to launch his movie career. None of this makes any kind of goddamned sense, is what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re acquainted with Kamandi as a character but you haven&rsquo;t read much of his adventures, maybe the <em>Kamandi Challenge Special</em> would be worth picking up. It does feature, after all, a talking gorilla revolutionary named Ramjam. But anyone unacquainted with Kamand should stay far away from this awkward, poorly planned book.</p>
