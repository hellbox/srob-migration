<p class="noindent">We're so excited to have <a href="https://www.matthewamsterburton.com" title="Matthew Amster-Burton">Matthew Amster-Burton</a> as our sponsor this week. His new novel _Our Secret Better Lives_ is a funny, stirring, and exciting tale. Set in 1994, it's about Katy, a huge music fan on a big adventure to a new state and college, who finds herself doing one thing she never imagined: stepping in front of a microphone in a new band.</p> 

<a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">We've got a full chapter, and more information, on our sponsor's page</a> so you can see just how deftly Matthew handles these engaging characters. No surprise &mdash; this may be his first novel, but it's his fifth book. Mark the date: <strong>March 19th at 11 am</strong>. That's when Matthew will be at Ada's Technical Books to talk about the work. But why wait? <a href="http://www.seattletechnicalbooks.com/book/9780998469805" title="Our Secret Better Lives (Paperback) | Ada&amp;#039;s Technical Books">Ada's has the book for sale on their website right now</a>.
