<p>The author of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> — and, so far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the author of <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/10/dont-set-a-watchman/">only <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em></a> — has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/19/harper-lee-author-to-kill-a-mockingbird-dies-alabama?CMP=twt_books-gdnbooks">died at age 89</a>.</p>

<p>Those who believe the Great American Novel is a singular experience have it wrong; there are many Great American Novels, each a timeless snapshot of a particular moment in American history. Of that tradition of Great American Novels, <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> is one of the very best, because it delivered the America that we all — Northern or Southern, black or white, woman or man — aspire to create. In one book, Harper Lee gave us the possibility and the promise of America. We could never possibly begin repay her for that tremendous achievement.</p>
