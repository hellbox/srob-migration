If you haven&rsquo;t picked up the winter/spring 2018 issue of <em>Poetry Northwest</em>, get to it: it&rsquo;s waiting in the magazine stand at your local independent bookstore. Every issue has a theme, and this time around it&rsquo;s visual poetry. <em>Poetry Northwest</em> always has a strong graphic element — the look of the publication gets more interesting with every issue — so we&rsquo;re excited to get our eyes on the pages of this one.  As part of their sponsorship of the site, the journal&rsquo;s sharing a couple of gorgeous inside peeks with our readers: stop by <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorship/">our sponsorship page</a> to check it out, then <a href="https://www.poetrynw.org/subscribe/">subscribe</a> to make sure you don&rsquo;t miss the next issue.</p>
