<p>Yesterday, Hugo House published the lineup of their 2016-2016 Word Works and Literary Series events.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://hugohouse.org/upcoming-events/hugo-literary-series/">Literary Series</a>, which pairs writers and musicians to produce new work on a theme includes authors like Téa Obrecht, Alexander Chee, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/tolstoys-unhappy-family-moves-to-the-northwest/">Megan Kruse</a>, and Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore and musicians including beautiful Seattle-based electronic act <a href="https://soundcloud.com/crater">Crater</a>. <a href="https://hugohouse.org/upcoming-events/word-works/">Word Works</a> is bringing authors like Patricia Smith (who kicked ass the last time she read at Hugo House,) Lidia Yuknavitch, and — perhaps most excitingly — Mary Gaitskill, who is one of the most underrated literary novelists in America today.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugohouse.org/upcoming-events/listing/">Non-series events presented by Hugo House this fall</a> include a much-anticipated reading by Colson Whitehead, a new book from Michelle Tea, the launch of Seattle author Steven Barker&rsquo;s debut non-fiction collection <em>Now for the Disappointing Part</em>, Ed Skoog&rsquo;s latest poetry collection, and Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore&rsquo;s Contagious Exchanges series, featuring discussions between queer artists (such as Rebecca Brown and C. Davida Ingram) moderated by Sycamore. This is just a sampling of what was announced; <a href="https://hugohouse.org/upcoming-events/listing/">go check out the House&rsquo;s site</a> for more details.</p>
