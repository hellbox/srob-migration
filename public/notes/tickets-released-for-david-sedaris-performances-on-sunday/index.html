<p class="noindent">Good news if you were frustrated by entirely sold-out shows for David Sedaris' series of readings &mdash; Sponsor Northwest Associated Arts has informed us that tickets for both the matinee and evening show this Sunday, the 15th, have just been released. <a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2705407" title="David Sedaris">Act fast!</a></p>

<p>If you somehow miss snagging one of those, we&rsquo;ve also been told that a small number of tickets will be available at the door for most performances. If you&rsquo;re deep Sedaris fan who wasn&rsquo;t able to grab tickets in time, you might want to give the box office a try right before the performances. You can also read more about all of this on our <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">Sponsor&rsquo;s page.</a></p>
