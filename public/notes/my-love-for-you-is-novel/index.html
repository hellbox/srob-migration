<p>Back in 2008, Screenwriter <a href="http://www.toddalcott.com">Todd Alcott</a> looked at a rather unique publishing oddity from the 1970s &mdash; a book-length marriage proposal to consumer advocate Ralph Nader. These days, we&rsquo;d call it stalking, but in those days the author Amy Devereaux, after her many letters went ignored, published her 165-page proposal (literally titled <em>Ralph Nader Will You Marry Me?</em>) in a form that can only be called &ldquo;epistolary plus&rdquo;. It contained letters, songs, stories, poems, and a musical play titled <em>Passionate Purple to Ralph Nader, a musical play</em>.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s certainly not the first author whose book was filled with delusional thinking. Hers just happens to be a time-capsule of dated akward cringiness.</p>
