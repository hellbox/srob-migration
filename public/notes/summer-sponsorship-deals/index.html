Of that block, only <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/"><del>three</del> <em>two</em> dates</a> remain available, in November and December. Thank you, sponsors!</p>

<p>But we still have a few dates left this Summer &mdash; one next week, and also a few in August. We&rsquo;ve just marked those down, so if you&rsquo;re looking for a sponsorship deal, head over to our <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">booking page and snap up the date you&rsquo;d like</a> before someone else does.</p>

<p>Your sponsorship gets you in front of Seattle&rsquo;s most passionate readers, and  your money goes to hire the writers and keep the site running. It&rsquo;s a virtuous cycle, and we couldn&rsquo;t do it without you. <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/">Come on board</a>, and be part of the team that keeps our community growing.</p>
