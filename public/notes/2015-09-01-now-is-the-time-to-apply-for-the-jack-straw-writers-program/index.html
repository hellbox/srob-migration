        <p>You have two months to <a href="http://www.jackstraw.org/programs/asp/2016/WP2016_application.shtml">apply for Jack Straw&rsquo;s 2016 Writers Program</a>. Don&rsquo;t know what that is? I&rsquo;ll let them explain:</p>

<blockquote>Twelve writers, selected by an invited curator, create new work during the residency to be presented through live readings, recorded interviews, a published anthology, and as podcasts on our web site. Participants also receive professional training in voice and microphone technique, performance and delivery, and interviews.</blockquote>

<p>Previous Jack Straw writers include Rebecca Hoogs and David Schmader. And this year&rsquo;s program curator is local poet Karen Finneyfrock, who is both an excellent writer and a brilliant reader of her own work, which means that if she selects you for the program, you <em>know</em> you&rsquo;ve got something special going on with your bad self. You literally have nothing to lose. <a href="http://www.jackstraw.org/programs/asp/2016/WP2016_application.shtml">Go apply today</a>, and then spend the next two months thinking about all the ways you&rsquo;ll be able to share your work with a solid year of Jack Straw&rsquo;s training.</p>
