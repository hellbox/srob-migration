<p>At her day job, Seattle cartoonist Colleen Frakes <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/journey-to-prison-island/">of <em>Prison Island</em> fame</a>is a librarian. She combined those two worlds in <a href="http://libguides.seattleu.edu/ld.php?content_id=21567858">a (PDF) comic about information literacy and librarian science</a>.
