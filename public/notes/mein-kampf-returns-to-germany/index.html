<blockquote>Adolf Hitler’s anti-Semitic manifesto *Mein Kampf* has been banned from Germany for 70 years, but will return to German bookstores next month.</blockquote>

<p>So many factors are at play here — atrocity, history, copyright, the free exchange of ideas — that really all we can do is wait and watch what happens. Will German bookstores carry <em>Mein Kampf</em>? Will people buy it? What happens when the most hateful, reviled, and influential book in the history of a nation becomes readily available again? We&rsquo;ll find out in 2016.</p>
