<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

<p><strong>There&rsquo;s this guy who rides the elevator with me at work pretty often. He always has a big, complex book in his hands — Bolaño, or DFW, or Knausgaard. He&rsquo;s pretty good looking, but I&rsquo;ve held off smiling at him because I&rsquo;m worried his choice of books means he&rsquo;s going to be pretty intellectually limited. Is there a safe way to test him in public before asking him out on a date?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Pat,</p>

<p>Here’s what I suggest: Start carrying around a copy of your favorite book in your bag. The next time you’re stuck in an elevator with this handsome stranger, break the ice by saying something like, “I notice you read a lot of very serious books written by unsmiling men, so I thought you might enjoy this change of pace. It’s my favorite.” The beauty is, it doesn’t really matter what your book is – it could be something truly great, like Octavia Butler’s <em>Bloodchild</em>, it could be last week’s <em>TV Guide</em>, or it could something he might actually enjoy, like the latest bullshit pumped out by Jonathan Franzen (if you go the <em>TV Guide</em> route, it helps to tape an unused condom to the inside cover). The point is, you’re being both flattering and assertive. If he’s smart and interested, he’ll read your book or at least continue the conversation. If he’s an intellectually stunted dummy, say “fuck it” and ask to see his abs. They can’t be any less interesting to talk to (and if by some miracle they are, you can always start taking the stairs).</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
