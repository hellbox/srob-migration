<p><a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/09/29/book-news-roundup-the-feminist-bookstore-from-portlandia-lashes-out/">Yesterday, I told you</a> that In Other Words, the feminist bookstore featured in the TV show <em>Portlandia</em> under the fictional name Women &amp; Women First, had put a &ldquo;Fuck <em>Portlandia</em>&rdquo; sign in its window, and when the <em>Willamette Week</em> reached out for comment, bookstore staff told the <em>Week</em> to &ldquo;go fuck themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, In Other Words has <a href="http://inotherwords.org/2016/09/28/fuck-portlandia/">written a post</a> explaining the sign. Also titled &ldquo;Fuck <em>Portlandia</em>,&rdquo; the post makes a great case for why In Other Words doesn&rsquo;t want to play by the show&rsquo;s rules anymore:</p>

<blockquote>This was a direct response to a particular egregious filming of the show in our space which saw our store left a mess, our staff mistreated, our neighbors forced to close and lose business for a day without warning, and our repeated attempts to obtain accountability or resolution dismissed.</blockquote>

<p>The post, <a href="http://inotherwords.org/2016/09/28/fuck-portlandia/">which you should definitely read</a>, explains a bunch of specific reasons why the store staff decided not to be involved with the show anymore: insufficient pay for use of the space, the questionable trans politics of the &ldquo;deeply shitty joke&rdquo; of Fred Armisen in a dress, and the fact that <em>Portlandia</em> staff reportedly asked In Other Words to remove the &ldquo;Black Lives Matter&rdquo; sign from their front window, along with other points.</p>

<p>It will no doubt be easy for reporters to make cheap &ldquo;unfunny feminist&rdquo; jokes about this post, but In Other Words makes a legitimate case here as to why they don&rsquo;t want to participate in <em>Portlandia</em> any more. I&rsquo;ll be curious to see if the show even bothers to respond to their allegations. If they do, I&rsquo;ll let you know.</p>
