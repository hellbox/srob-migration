<p>You may have noticed a new style of sponsorship on the site today: event sponsorship. Our inaugural partner for this is the Seattle Antiquarian Bookfair, an annual rare books and ephemera festival now in its twenty-eighth year. Read more about the fair, and mark it in your calendars: October 10th &amp; 11th — and thanks to them for sponsoring the site.</p>

<p>We’ve been asked a few times — how are the sponsorships going? We think they’re going great. We originally released a block of inventory through January at a discounted rate of $100 a week. Of that, we’ve only got 8 weeks left. If you’re thinking about sponsoring, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">now would be the time to reserve your week</a>.</p>

<p>With all the hullaballoo over online advertising lately, we’re proud to offer a product that is relevant, real, and we think, good content. We’re proud of our partners so far, and hope you’ve been enjoying them. Remember to take a look each week.
