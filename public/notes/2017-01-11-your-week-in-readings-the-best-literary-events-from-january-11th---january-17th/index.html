<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Wednesday January 11th: Cat Rambo and Margaret Chiavetta</strong></h5></p>
Two Seattle-based fantasy authors debut new work at Seattle’s best sci-fi bookstore. If you’ve been involved in our sci-fi community, you likely know Rambo’s name. Her newest book, <em>Neither Here Nor There</em>, is a collection of fantasy stories. You can see a tiny version of the nifty flip-cover format of the book right above this calendar entry. Chiavetta’s <em>Sir Duffy’s Promise</em> is the first in a new middle-reader fantasy series
 <em>University Book Store,  4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, <a href="http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/">http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/</a>. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. </em></p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Thursday January 12th: <em>Leaving the Planet</em> Opening Reception</strong></h5></p>
Greg Stump’s deceptively simple comics are Seattle’s best-kept secret. From his early-2000s comic contributions to <em>The Stranger</em> to his magnum opus <em>Disillusioned Illusions</em>, Stump has been gradually stripping away all artifice to discover a kind of cartooning nirvana. Tonight, Stump kicks off his first non-comics art show with <em>Leaving the Planet</em>, an ink-and-watercolor extravaganza showcase.
 *Joe Bar, 810 E. Roy St., 324-0407. Free. All ages. 6 p.m.* </p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday January 13th: <em>Indigenous London</em> Reading
**</h5></p>
 Canadian history professor Coll Thrush, who wrote a terrific history of indigenous Seattle, returns with a book about the history of native peoples from America and New Zealand who traveled to the very center of the British Empire from the 16th century onward. This is a fascinating new twist on the study of colonialism.
*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, <a href="http://elliottbaybook.com ">http://elliottbaybook.com </a>. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. * </p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Saturday January 14th: Bring on 2017!</strong></h5></p>
Open Books, under the guidance of new owner Billie Swift, has been kicking ass with its reading series lately. The store kicks off a new year of literary events with a reading from four Seattle-area poets: Samar Abulhassan, Natasha Marin, Imani Sims, and Anastacia Renee Tolbert. Come join the party.

<p><h5>**Sunday January 15th: Writers Resist: A Celebration of Free Speech
**</h5></p>
It seems impossible that this week will bring both the annual celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr. <em>and</em> Donald Trump’s inauguration. But here we are. To mentally prepare for the discord to come, why not attend this freedom-minded reading by writers from Bellingham (Robert Lashley) and Spokane (novelist Jess Walter, poet Tod Marshall) and Seattle (Elissa Washuta, Jane Wong, G. Willow Wilson)?
 *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m. * </p>

<p><h5><strong>Monday January 16th: Something Special</strong></h5></p>
The Egyptian Theatre is so beautiful and so welcoming that I’ve always thought it was kind of a shame that nobody ever hosted a reading there. Tonight, my dream comes true: Something Special is a multimedia celebration of short films, music (from Cosmos the Band) and spoken word (from Nikkita Oliver, Troy Osaki, and Leija Farr.)
 <em>Egyptian Theatre, 805 E. Pine St., 324-9996, <a href="http://www.siff.net">http://www.siff.net</a>. $10. All ages. 9 p.m. </em></p>
