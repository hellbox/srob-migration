* [*Moss*](http://www.mosslit.com/vol02/issue05.html), the excellent free Northwest-centric literary magazine, is offering [$20 annual subscriptions through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mosslit), which gets you an annual print edition and early access to each quarterly issue of the magazine. This is absolutely a steal. Give if  you can.

* You have until Halloween to apply for the [Jack Straw Artist Residency programs](http://jackstraw.org/programs/asp/2017/2017_apps.shtml), which teach artists how to better use sound as a medium. Most writers are, sad to say, terrible readers of their own work. A program like Jack Straw immediately gives writers an edge over the competition by teaching them how to present their work in a reading, radio, or podcast setting. The writers program curator this year is poet and essayist Jourdan Imani Keith, who it is safe to say knows a thing or two about reading work aloud. [Get your applications in by 5 pm on the 31st](http://jackstraw.org/programs/asp/2017/WP2017_application.shtml).

* [Push/Pull](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/06/pushpull-gallery-is-our-january-bookstore-of-the-month/), up in Ballard, is [looking for new members](http://pushpullseattle.weebly.com/join.html) to help run the space. If you're an artist with a lot of work to sell — comics, art, crafts — you should consider joining the team. 

* Ebooks were [not that as big a deal as at least one major publisher thought they'd be](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/14/penguin-boss-admits-the-company-read-too-much-into-the-ebook-hyp/):

<blockquote>Penguin wrongly lost confidence in the power of the printed word and invested “unwisely” amid the rise of eBooks, one of the company’s bosses has admitted.</blockquote>

* Mark Haddon [joins the list of big-name authors](https://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2016/oct/17/mark-haddon-joins-john-le-carre-and-ian-rankin-in-the-fight-against-amazon) who are making a case against buying books on Amazon.

* It's kind of hilarious that [the Nobel Committee can't get a hold of Bob Dylan](http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/bob-dylan-plays-hard-to-get-with-nobel-committee.html).

* [This poem by Joe Turrent](http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/joeturrent/) is not extremely successful, but it is interesting: it's an erasure by way of Microsoft Word's "track changes" feature.

* Now the [Pulitzer Prize is open to magazines](http://www.pulitzer.org/news/pulitzer-prizes-open-all-journalism-categories-magazines) in all categories. Formerly, only newspapers were eligible for many of the categories. Get ready for the *New Yorker* and the *New York Times* to go head-to-head forever.

* This comic-strip reimagining of *Watchmen* is perhaps the best thing I've seen on Twitter this month. (Thanks to *SRoB* tipper [@E_Steven](https://twitter.com/E_Steven) for the tip.)

* Novelist Brit Bennett, whose new novel *The Mothers* is one of the most buzzed-about books of the fall, wrote [a guest post for Seattle Public Library](https://shelftalkblog.wordpress.com/2016/10/18/a-note-from-brit-bennett-author-of-the-mothers/) about the importance of libraries in her life.

* Speaking of the Seattle Public Library, librarian Misha Stone was on KING 5 the other day talking about book clubs. — what makes book clubs work, what books book clubs are reading these days, and so on It's definitely worth your time:
