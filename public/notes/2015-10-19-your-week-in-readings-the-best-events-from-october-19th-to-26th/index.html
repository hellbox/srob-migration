      <div class="content">
        <p><strong>MONDAY</strong> Start the week off with some librarians at a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1501246780167954/">Bookish Happy Hour at the Diller Room</a>. This is part of Seattle Public Library’s Booktoberfest program, which brings librarians, beer, and you together in non-traditional venues.</p>

<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1445196439733/Freemans.jpg" alt="" /></p><strong>TUESDAY</strong> I’ve been looking forward to this for months now: <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/colum-mccann-john-freeman-paul-constant-seattle-public-library">at the Seattle Public Library</a>, I’m participating in an event with <strong>Colum McCann and John Freeman</strong>. McCann, of course, is a beloved novelist who manages to span that widest of chasms: he writes — gasp! — bestselling literary fiction. His newest collection is titled <em>Thirteen Ways of Looking</em>, and it contains a novella and three short stories, touching on security and our modern panopticon of a society and also heartbreak, because you can’t have a McCann story without heartbreak. Freeman is well-known in the publishing industry: he was editor at <em>Granta</em>, he’s a noteworthy literary critic (which makes him as rare as mermaid’s tears), and now he’s starting a new magazine called <em>Freeman’s</em>, which presents new work based on a theme. The first issue is centered around the idea of “Arrival,” and it features talent like McCann, Haruki Murakami, Louise Erdrich, and Dave Eggers. This is an explosive debut for a literary magazine, and this event should be a lot of fun.</p>

<p>But of course, because I’m involved in that event, I’m naturally biased. So allow me to present an <strong>ALTERNATE TUESDAY</strong> event for your edification. At <a href="http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=10&amp;evyear=2015&amp;eventid=2015062217553100&amp;pre=20151012&amp;pst=20151028">Town Hall Seattle</a>, <strong>Jack Nisbet</strong> will appear in conversation with <strong>John Marzluff</strong>, a professor of wildlife science, and geologist <strong>David Montgomery</strong>. Nisbet’s newest book <em>Ancient Places</em> explores the relationship between the landscape and the culture of the Pacific Northwest,.</p>

<p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong> The WordsWest Literary Series will happen <a href="http://wordswestliterary.weebly.com/">at C&amp;P Coffee Company in West Seattle</a>. This is a monthly reading series that brings new and established talent to a neighborhood that doesn’t see very many literary events. Tonight’s readers are KUOW journalist <strong>Ruby de Luna</strong>, who has reported on immigrant communities and health care, and <strong>Stephanie Timm</strong>, an author who recently wrote a play titled <em>Tails of Wasps</em> and co-authored an adaptation of <em>The Ramayana</em> with Yussef el Guindi.</p>

<p><strong>THURSDAY</strong> Obviously, you’re going to <a href="http://litcrawl.org/seattle/">Lit Crawl Seattle</a>. This is not optional.</p>

<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong> <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/joe-meno-nina-revoyr">Elliott Bay Book Company</a> hosts two novelists who have been published by the wonderful publisher Akashic Books. <strong>Joe Meno</strong> will read from his new novel, <em>Marvel and a Wonder</em>, which is about a farm, horse-racing, and family. <strong>Nina Revoyr</strong>’s new novel  <em>Lost Canyon</em> is about four backpackers who go on a trip that finds them outside of their comfort zone.</p>

<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong> <a href="http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=10&amp;evyear=2015&amp;eventid=2015091813464500">University Book Store</a> presents a special reading with Seattle author <strong>G. Willow Wilson</strong> and writer <strong>Margaret Stohl</strong>. They’ll be signing their new books: Wilson’s latest comic is  <em>A-Force</em>, which features an all-woman team of superheroes, and  Stohl recently published a young adult novel starring the Marvel character Black Widow. While mainstream comics is slowly opening up to women, it’s still a predominantly male-dominated field. This is a rare chance to meet and talk with two women who have made names for themselves and thrived in that industry. Go show them some love.</p>

<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong> <a href="http://hugohouse.org/event/floating-bridge-press-chapbook-winners/">Hugo House</a> hosts a reading from Floating Bridge Press chapbook winners. Every year, great local publisher Floating Bridge Press sponsors a contest that finds a new poet and publishes their work. This year’s winner is <strong>Michael Schmeltzer</strong>, who will read from his chapbook,  <em>Elegy/Elk River</em>. (He’s also got a book coming out soon from Two Sylvias Press.)  Several finalists from the contest— <strong>Maya Jewell Zeller, Brian Cooney, and Linda Malnack</strong> — will also read. This is a great chance to see some new poets do their thing; you’ll likely be seeing these names around town for years to come. Why not get a head start tonight?</p>
