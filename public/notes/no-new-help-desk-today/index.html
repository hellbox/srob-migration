<p>Cienna Madrid is taking Labor Day weekend off. She will return next week. If you can&rsquo;t go a single Friday without a Help Desk — believe me, I know the feeling — we have <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-help-desk/">a year&rsquo;s worth of columns here for you to enjoy</a>. On a related note: we at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> hope you have a fantastic Labor Day weekend. <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/_wh_previews/notes/a9e3dd52-7d9a-6edc-5bbb-e6a48f9d00a7/">We&rsquo;ll see you at Bumbershoot this Sunday</a>!</p>

<p>And as always: if you need advice on a literary (or literary-adjacent) matter, please <strong>send Cienna a question at advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com</strong>. Your anonymity is guaranteed. Her advice might not always be what you want to hear, but it is one hundred percent guaranteed to be correct.</p>
