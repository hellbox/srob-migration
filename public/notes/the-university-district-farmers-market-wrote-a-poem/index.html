<p>Kristen Steenbeeke <a href="https://hugohouse.org/the-u-district-farmers-market-is-prolific/">reports</a> that Hugo House&rsquo;s crowd-sourced poetry experiment has come to a close for the year. Last week, Hugo House set up a stand with a typewriter at the University District Farmer&rsquo;s Market and encouraged passers-by to contribute to a group poem. The poets were only allowed to write one line, and they were only allowed to read the line that came before their line.</p>

<p>Is <a href="https://hugohouse.org/the-u-district-farmers-market-is-prolific/">the end result</a> great poetry? Well, no. But it is fascinating stuff. I especially like how the poem shifts moods wildly from one poet to the next: the nonsensically giddy &ldquo;Happy day party time new baby&rdquo; gives way to &ldquo;the fog rolls in,&rdquo; and then &ldquo;the gray hearkens her mind&rdquo; is followed by &ldquo;happy thoughts shine through.&rdquo; This is <strong>a group of anonymous Seattleites, telling each other to cheer up</strong> through the fall gloom. The poem&rsquo;s multitudinous attentions eventually wander to pumpkins and octopuses and apricot danishes. As a narrative, it says nothing much at all. But as a collective gauge of the mood of a large crowd of Seattleites in the middle of a chilly November, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s surprisingly accurate.</p>
