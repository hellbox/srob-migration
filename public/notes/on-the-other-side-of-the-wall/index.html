<p>The woman at the door of the <a href="https://www.black-imagination.com/"><em>BLACK IMAGINATION: The States of Matter</em></a> show at CORE Gallery asked me point blank: &ldquo;are you a white man?&rdquo; It was literally the first time in my entire life that anyone had ever asked me that question, and I had to pause for a minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh, yes,&rdquo; I eventually replied. I&rsquo;d been invited to the opening night &ldquo;celebration of Black joy&rdquo; from four Black Seattle storytellers — Natasha Marin, Imani Sims, Amber Flame, and Rachael Ferguson — and I hadn&rsquo;t been told about this part of the entry process. The doorperson explained that white people weren&rsquo;t allowed in the back half of the gallery tonight. That part was just for people of color. I could wander all I wanted around the front room, she said. And so I did.</p>

<p>A woman in an ornate dress sat on the floor, DJing the music. (&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Explain,&rdquo; by Billie Holliday, first, then <a href="https://www.shazam.com/track/69228166/quintet-whizzin-away-along-de-track">&ldquo;Whizzin&rsquo; Away Along De Track.&rdquo;</a>) In the other corner of the room, a woman listening to an iPod through headhphones drew on a piece of paper taped to the wall. &ldquo;I WAS A STAR,&rdquo; one drawing of a cosmic firmament read. She&rsquo;d occasionally stop to comb through her hair with an afro pick.</p>

<p>Behind a curtain, I could hear voices raised up in song. Laughter. Stories being told. Nothing came through too clearly, though; I couldn&rsquo;t hear the specifics. A tall white man stood by the curtain, and a Black woman gently explained to him, &ldquo;white folks aren&rsquo;t allowed back there tonight.&rdquo; The man replied, seemingly instinctually, &ldquo;okay, but&hellip;&rdquo; and then he stopped talking. The point came through loud and clear, and he chuckled at himself, and then he walked away.</p>

<p>On the other side of the wall, people laughed raucously about something I couldn&rsquo;t hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;WE ALL TOOK CARE OF EACH OTHER,&rdquo; the woman wrote on another drawing while listening to a song I couldn&rsquo;t — that I wasn&rsquo;t meant to — hear.</p>
