<p>The bad news is that the film adaptation of local author Jonathan Evison&rsquo;s spectacular novel <em>The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving</em> has been changed. It&rsquo;s now <em>The Fundamentals of Caring</em>, a title that sacrifices specificity at the altar of sentiment.</p>

<p>But! Here&rsquo;s the good news: it stars Paul Rudd, so I will still be there for this movie whenever it opens locally. And here&rsquo;s the even-better news: <a href="http://www.finalreel.co.uk/the-fundamentals-of-caring-first-look/#more-15650">it was announced last week</a> that <em>The Fundamentals of Caring</em> will be the Closing Film at this coming year&rsquo;s Sundance film festival, a position of pride that indicates confidence in the quality of the film. Might we get to see it at next year&rsquo;s SIFF? Here&rsquo;s hoping.</p>
