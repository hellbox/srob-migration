<p class="noindent">**What are you reading now?**</p>

<p class="noindent">
I'm currently reading [_Memento Park_](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780374206376?aff=hellbox), which is a supremely assured, elegantly crafted second novel from a former book blogger <a href="https://www.marksarvas.com" title="Mark Sarvas - Author of Memento Park">Mark Sarvas</a> (<a href="http://marksarvas.blogs.com" title="The Elegant Variation">The Elegant Variation</a>). Mark was always a very tough critic, not unlike Peter Bogdanovich, and like Bogdanovich, Sarvas has put his money where his mouth is and delivered a fine piece of work about fathers and sons, art, and family revelations. It's totally unlike any book I would ever write, which is another reason I'm digging it.

<p class="noindent">**What did you read last?**</p>

<p class="noindent">
    I just finished (for the second time!) a spectacular self- published novel called [_Jimmy James Blood_](https://www.facebook.com/pg/JimmyJamesBlood/) by <a href="http://www.missyanne.com" title="Missy Anne Peterson">Missy Ann Peterson</a>. Missy comes to the literary world out of nowhere. Last I checked she was working on a road crew in Montana. It's obvious the novel is born of hard-bitten experience. Reading _Jimmy James Blood_ is a visceral and stirring experience from the very first sentence. Missy goes from lyrical to gritty in a single turn of phrase, and she does it over and over again. I am currently lobbying publishers to grant this book the release it deserves.

<p class="noindent">**What are you reading next?**</p>

<p class="noindent">
Sigh. So many choices, so little time. As you might imagine, my "blurb pile" is halfway to the ceiling. I'm not even sure what's next in the queue, but in the spirit of our forthcoming NHL franchise, I'm hoping to soon read an early draft of [Jarret Middleton's](http://www.jarretmiddleton.com) _Heart of Winter_, which is destined to be the definitive hockey novel of the twenty-first century (not hyperbole!).
