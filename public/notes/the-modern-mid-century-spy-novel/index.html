<p>Sponsor Paul Vidich&rsquo;s <em>An Honorable Man</em> has been getting a great reception. It&rsquo;s Washington D.C., 1953, and any fan of spy novels knows that this time is pivotal in the espionage game. Russia in chaos after Stalin died, McCarthyism taking root at home, the Cold War starting its long tense march.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">got a full chapter on our sponsor&rsquo;s page</a> for you to read and see what you think. <em>An Honorable Man</em> is the perfect Father&rsquo;s Day book, a taut thriller set in an important American past.</p>
