This is not the first time [this has happened](http://deadline.com/2016/08/barnes-noble-fires-ceo-ronald-boire-not-good-fit-1201804473/):

<blockquote>Barnes & Noble just unceremoniously ousted Ronald Boire as CEO, saying that the board has deemed him “not a good fit for the organization and that it was in the best interests of all parties for him to leave the Company.”</blockquote>

Boire was at the top of the chain book retailer for less than a year. This puts longtime Barnes & Noble leader Leonard Riggio back in charge of the chain that he founded in 1965 and has led, on-and-off, ever since. Riggio was set to retire next month, which makes him yet another victim of [retirony](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retirony).

Will Barnes & Noble ever find someone to lead it into the future? Or will Riggio have to permanently postpone his retirement in order to keep the retailer on life support? Barnes & Noble's demise would create a depressing number of brick-and-mortar "bookstore deserts" in rural and suburban parts of America; the cultural stakes are way too high. At this point, even most independent booksellers I know are cheering on Barnes & Noble's continuing survival. Let's hope they figure it out.
