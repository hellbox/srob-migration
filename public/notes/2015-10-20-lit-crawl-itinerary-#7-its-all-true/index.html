        <p class="intro">On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our seventh suggested itinerary:</p>

<p>All of the readings on this itinerary feature true, honest-to-God, not-made-up stories.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong>. At Town Hall to start out the night, memoirists Sarah Hepola (<em>Blackout</em>) and Melissa Febos (<em>Whip Smart</em>) will read from their stories of sobriety and recovery.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>.  Office Nomads hosts the perennial Lit Crawl favorite event: Wage Slaves: Tales from the Grind. Local spoken word poet Daemond Arrindell, memoirist Nicole Hardy, and essayist Corina Zappia will talk about their experiences working in offices. To whet your appetite, Zappia wrote <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2015/01/i-was-an-amazon-chew-toy">an excellent piece for The Awl</a> about working in Amazon&rsquo;s dog-friendly offices.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>. Okay, this last event is kind of a cheat. It&rsquo;s a reading from two Tin House authors at Elliott Bay. One of them is a novelist: Sara Jaffe reads from her debut novel <em>Dryland</em>. But Sonya Lea also reads from her memoir <em>Wondering Who You Are</em>, which is raw and true enough to more than make up for the single piece of fiction that snuck through onto our itinerary.</p>
