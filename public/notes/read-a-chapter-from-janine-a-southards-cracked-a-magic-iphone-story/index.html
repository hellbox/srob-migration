<p>Our sincerest thanks to Janine A. Southard for sponsoring <em>The Seattle Review of Books</em> this week.</p>

<p>In the hilarious, and well-loved <em>Cracked! A Magic iPhone Story</em> (four stars on Amazon!), the award-winning Southard (a Seattle denizen) shows you how the geeks of Seattle live, provides a running and often-hilarious social commentary on todayâ€™s world, and reminds you that, so long as you have friends, you are never alone.</p>

<p>Help support The <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> by <a href="/sponsorships/">reading her excerpt</a> and ordering the novel if you like what you read.</p>
