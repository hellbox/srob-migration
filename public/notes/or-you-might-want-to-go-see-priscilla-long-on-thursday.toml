<p class="noindent">Paul has <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/11/09/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-november-9th-november-15th/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Your Week in Readings: The best literary events from November 9th - November 15th">recommended you go see Steven Barker</a> on Thursday night at Hugo House. While I think that's a great option, I wanted to also recommend an alternative: <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/priscilla-long-0" title="PRISCILLA LONG | The Elliott Bay Book Company">Priscilla Long at the Elliott Bay Book Company</a>.</p>

Long has two newly released books: _Minding The Muse: a Handbook for Painters, Composers, Writers, and Other Creators_ (<a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/help-selfie/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Help selfie">reviewed today by Bonnie J Rough</a>), and _Fire and Stone: Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?_, a book of essays. 

She's a local poet (we <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/09/20/art-life/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Art &amp;amp; Life">ran one by her a few months ago</a>) teacher, and long-time friend to writers (_The Writer's Portable Mentor_, from 2010, is a particular favorite of mine). Her background exploring the history of creativity, art, and expressions of everything from joy to grief will no doubt make interesting conversation in our current climate. 

_Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600. Free. All ages. 7 p.m._
