<p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Wednesday October 26th: <em>The Hidden Lives of Owls</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Look, fuck the election; it’s time to talk about owls. Leigh Calvez is an owl expert who will explain why owls are simultaneously cooler and more disgusting than the Harry Potter books ever let on.  Maybe she’ll also explain why they’re always wearing graduation caps in cartoons even if they haven’t graduated college.
