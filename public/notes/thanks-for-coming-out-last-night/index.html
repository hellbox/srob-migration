<p class="noindent">Last night was not an official _Seattle Review of Books_ party, it was the launch party for my book [_California Four O'Clock_](http://californiafouroclock.com). But since Paul and I were both there, and we talked about the site, and since some of you were there too and came up to say hello and introduce yourselves, I just wanted to say thank you. We had a grand time.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d never been before, you may realize now why we <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/meet-mercer-street-books-our-first-bookstore-of-the-month/">go</a> <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/12/everything-has-its-place-at-mercer-street-books/">on</a> <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/19/every-used-book-tells-at-least-two-stories/">and</a> <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/26/the-education-of-mercer-street-books/">on</a> about Mercer Street Books. It&rsquo;s a great store, and I&rsquo;m very appreciative to Debbie Sarrow for having us. We&rsquo;ll let you know next time we&rsquo;re having a party, and if you missed this one, we hope you can make the next.</p>
