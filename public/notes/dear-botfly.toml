You are not a machine, but a mechanic<br>
tooling out from under skin. And in<br>
my head, you might take flight, alight<br>
with chandeliers of sand. A man said<br>
_one is the loneliest number_, but this<br>
doesn’t square. I swore I’d shaken<br>
you out, but my hair parted, and there<br>
you were. Part of me, do you smart<br>
with the sting of the repressed? I’m blessed,<br>
but some day you’ll depart, a fingerwave<br>
to your avuncular host. Then I’ll be lost.<br><br>
Yours,<br><br>
