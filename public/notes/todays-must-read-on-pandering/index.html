<p>The entire literary internet is currently exploding — in a good way, in a <em>great</em> way — over <a href="http://www.tinhouse.com/blog/41314/on-pandering.html">&ldquo;On Pandering,&rdquo; an essay by Claire Vaye Watkins at <em>Tin House</em></a>. She tells a story about a male author behaving badly, she talks about the institutional gender bias of the publishing industry, she tears some preconceptions down to the studs and examines what&rsquo;s left. It&rsquo;s angry, funny, shocking, intelligent and, in the end, hopeful. <a href="http://www.tinhouse.com/blog/41314/on-pandering.html">You really have to read it</a>.</p>
