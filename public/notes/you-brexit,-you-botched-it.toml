Well, er, good morning. Seattle writers are responding to the news that the world's gone all Trumpy. You should read [Nicola Griffith on Brexit](https://nicolagriffith.com/2016/06/24/uk-rip/):

<blockquote>This vote broke the UK; it might break the EU. There will be a recession, a bad one. The xenophobes have been unleashed. This result has invited the whirlwind.</blockquote>

We're starting to see [posts about what Brexit means for the publishing industry](http://publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/international/international-book-news/article/70751-what-brexit-means-for-book-publishing.html), but the truth is that nobody knows what's going to happen — not really. If you console yourself on difficult news days by watching very smart people try to think their way through events, Adam Rakunas has been [very active on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rakdaddy/status/746375199839256576?lang=en) about all this, and G. Willow Wilson is [always a worthy Twitter follow](https://twitter.com/GWillowWilson?lang=en).

Some mornings you wake up and the world goes all screwy. The fact is, though, there are some things that are always true: You should vote. (You should *always* vote.) You should keep an open mind, and think before you speak. You should find the smartest, most compassionate people you know, and you should really listen to what they're saying. You should point out untruths when you see them and speak up for people who don't have a voice. And, of course, [you've got to be kind](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1889-hello-babies-welcome-to-earth-it-s-hot-in-the-summer).
