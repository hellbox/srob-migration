<li><p>Yesterday, <a href="http://fantagraphics.com/flog/breakdown/">Fantagraphics Books announced</a> that they&rsquo;re entering into a partnership with young British comics publisher Breakdown Press. The Seattle-based publisher is bringing some (not all) of the very best of Breakdown&rsquo;s output to American bookstores and comics shops, starting with <a href="http://www.breakdownpress.com/store/the-artist">Anna Haifisch&rsquo;s book <em>The Artist</em></a> and <a href="http://www.breakdownpress.com/store/red-red-rock-and-other-stories-1967-1970">Hayashi Seiichi&rsquo;s book <em>Red Red Rocks and Other Stories 1967-1970</em></a>. Breakdown&rsquo;s catalog <a href="http://www.breakdownpress.com/store/">looks very cool</a> — a mix of international artists working in a variety of styles.</p></li>

<li><p>Congratulations to Seattle poet Don Mee Choi, who won a <a href="http://www.lannan.org/literary/detail/don-mee-choi/">Lannan Literary Fellowship for Poetry</a>. We loved her most recent book of poetry, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-adverbs-of-war/"><em>Hardly War</em></a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Did you know that the Seattle Public Library has a searchable collection of titles that have been tagged #BlackLivesMatter? <a href="https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;t=tag&amp;search_category=tag&amp;q=blacklivesmatter">It&rsquo;s true</a>. Thank you for doing this, SPL. By making these books available and tagged, you&rsquo;re helping Seattle&rsquo;s African-American community and its allies find much-needed resources. This is terrific.</p></li>

<li><p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s election has <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/11/after-trumps-election-news-organizations-see-a-bump-in-subscriptions-and-donations/">spurred a number of Americans to buy subscriptions to magazines and newspapers</a>. This does not count as Making America Great Again; Trump doesn&rsquo;t get credit for revitalizing print media by being a big asshole.</p></li>

<li><p>Today in depressing legal battles, Dr. Seuss&rsquo;s estate is <a href="http://geeknation.com/dr-seuss-estate-sues-star-trek-writer-over-comic-book/">suing a writer and artist</a> for their <em>Star Trek</em>-themed Seuss parody book.</p></li>

<blockquote>Dr. Seuss Enterprises, the California company that owns the rights to all the works of author and illustrator Theodor S. Geisel – better known as Dr. Seuss – have sued a Connecticut-based comic book company, ComicMix, as well as the company’s president for copyright and trademark infringement, and unfair competition. It’s all over a book called *Oh, the Places You’ll Boldly Go!* written by classic Star Trek scribe David Gerrold and illustrated by Ty Templeton.</blockquote>
