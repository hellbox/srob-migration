<p>Congratulations to Sherman Alexie, who was nominated for his children&rsquo;s book <em>Thunder Boy Jr.</em> in the Young Readers&rsquo; Literature category. We loved the book (as did our resident six-year-old).</p>

<p>And now seems like a good time to announce: join us, Sherman Alexie, Robert Lashley, and EJ Koh at the Elliott Bay Book Company on November 11th for a poetry reading. Eagle-eyed viewers will recognize this as our Bumbershoot lineup. We felt the night was so magical, we wanted to recreate it outside of the ticketed bounds of the Bumbershoot arena. Mark the date &mdash;Â we look forward to seeing you there.</p>
