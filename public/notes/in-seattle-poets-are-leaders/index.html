<p>The <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> doesn&rsquo;t run endorsements, but when a writer runs for office, we notice. In case you missed it, mayoral candidate Nikkita Oliver dropped some verses at last night&rsquo;s Candidate Survivor event at Neumo&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that this happened — Oliver is a teacher and a community leader and an award-winning spoken-word poet, and Candidate Survivor is a nontraditional event co-produced by the awesome <a href="http://www.washingtonbus.org/">Washington Bus</a> — but it&rsquo;s still <strong>pretty fucking cool</strong>. A major mayoral candidate performed poetry in front of hundreds of adoring people. That simply wouldn&rsquo;t happen in many other American cities.</p>
