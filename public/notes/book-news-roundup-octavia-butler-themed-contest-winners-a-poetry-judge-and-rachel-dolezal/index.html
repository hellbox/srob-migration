<li><p>Hugo House Executive Director Tree Swenson is a judge in the poetry category for the 2016 National Book Awards. The <a href="http://www.capitolhilltimes.com/2016/04/hugo-house-executive-director-to-judge-poetry-for-2016-national-book-awards/"><em>Capitol Hill Times</em> interviewed her</a> about the honor.</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of Hugo House, they&rsquo;re still <a href="https://hugohouse.submittable.com/submit/28902">looking for writers in residence</a>. This will be for the term when Hugo House is sharing space with the Frye Art Museum, so technically, you&rsquo;d be the writer-in-temporary-residence, which is kind of a cool distinction. Deadline for that is April 30.</p></li>

<li><p>And while we&rsquo;re at it, poets should be advised that the <a href="https://hugohouse.org/store/class/red-lineage-hackathon-natasha-marin/">Red Lineage Hackathon</a> is coming up on April 23rd at the Hugo House. It &ldquo;gives poets an opportunity to create web-based poems for Red Lineage, a global collaborative poetry project created by local poet and conceptual artist, Natasha Marin,&rdquo; using whatever technology is available to them. To learn more about Red Lineage, <a href="http://redlineage.com/">visit their website</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Last summer&rsquo;s hot mess, Rachel Dolezal, is apparently going to <a href="http://www.people.com/article/rachel-dolezal-no-regrets-today-show">write a book</a> about her controversial statements that she identifies as black. Let me remind you right now that you don&rsquo;t have to buy this book when it comes out. In fact, it would probably be better for everyone if we all agreed to not buy this damn book.</p></li>

<li><p>Some 90 Mississippi authors — including bestsellers like John Grisham, Donna Tartt, and Kathryn Stockett— have <a href="http://deadline.com/2016/04/mississippi-authors-call-repeal-anti-gay-law-1201735725/">signed a petition</a> protesting their state&rsquo;s new anti-gay law. You never see authors signing petitions in favor of anti-gay laws; that&rsquo;s part of the reason why books are so terrific.</p></li>
