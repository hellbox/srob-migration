<li><p>Regarding yesterday&rsquo;s news that <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/9/7/16266142/new-amazon-headquarters-rfp-north-america">Amazon is looking to build an &ldquo;equal&rdquo; headquarters in some other North American city than Seattle</a>: I was a bookseller for twelve years, first <a href="https://medium.com/@paulconstant/books-without-borders-b8ccb08b5b8a">at a chain that Amazon destroyed</a> and then at an independent bookseller. I have learned through painful experience never to trust Amazon. Yes, it&rsquo;s probably true that Amazon will soon be too big for Seattle alone. But if you think Amazon isn&rsquo;t going to use this opportunity to pit one &ldquo;headquarters&rdquo; city against another in a race to the bottom, you&rsquo;re mistaken. They will gladly take Seattle&rsquo;s future hostage in exchange for a shiny new tax cut. I have learned from experience that Amazon will do whatever it takes to come out on top.</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of chain bookstores, there&rsquo;s <a href="https://the-digital-reader.com/2017/09/07/bn-revenues-declined-6-6-first-quarter-nook-revenues-dropped-29/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheDigitalReader+%28The+Digital+Reader%29">no good news coming out of Barnes &amp; Noble</a> these days — particularly in the ebooks division:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Total company [first quarter] revenues fell 6.6% to $853 million, while Nook revenues fell 28.1%, to $29.5 million. That is literally the lowest Nook revenues ever recorded.</blockquote>

<li><p>So that book written by Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s pastor has just been <a href="https://www.mhpbooks.com/book-of-daily-devotionals-from-hillary-clintons-pastor-pulled-and-pulped-due-to-plagiarism/">pulled from shelves</a> due to rampant plagiarism.</p></li>

<li><p>Big changes at <em>Vanity Fair</em>, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/business/media/graydon-carter-vanity-fair.html?mcubz=3&amp;_r=0">editor Graydon Carter is retiring</a>. Here is where I&rsquo;d ordinarily say this is a great opportunity for an enterprising young editor to make her mark and reimagine the glossy magazine for a new generation, but come <em>on</em>. We all know that&rsquo;s not going to happen. It&rsquo;s been sad watching <em>Vanity Fair</em> shrink to anemic sizes; that last Hollywood issue was a shadow of years past.</p></li>
