<p>We think you&rsquo;ll really like his week&rsquo;s sponsor <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">G.G. Silverman&rsquo;s work</a>. It&rsquo;s funny, smart, and we think that after you look at two chapters on our sponsor page, you might even want your own copy. Those chapters will only be up through tomorrow, so <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">go take a look today</a>!</p>

<p>G.G. partnered with us as part of our drive to make <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">internet advertising 100 percent less terrible</a>. We ask that you look at our sponsors each week, and see if they speak to you. That&rsquo;s it! Let&rsquo;s change the future of sponsorship together.</p>
