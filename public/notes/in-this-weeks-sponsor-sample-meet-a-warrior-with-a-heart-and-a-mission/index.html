The fabulous <a href="https://www.facebook.com/greysunpress/">Grey Sun Press</a> is this week&rsquo;s sponsor, and they&rsquo;re sharing a meaty chapter from the fast-paced fantasy epic <em>Amaskan&rsquo;s Blood</em> by Seattle author Raven Oak. The first book in the Boahim series, <em>Amaskan&rsquo;s Blood</em> introduces a young woman warrior with a bit of a problem: she&rsquo;s miles from home and from her people, tangled in political intrigue, and suddenly unsure that even her name is her own. The e-book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amaskans-Blood-Boahim-Book-1-ebook/dp/B00P2ZSGUE/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">available on Amazon.com this week for just $0.99</a> — a crazy small amount of money for this much fun.</p>

<p>The excerpt, a boudoir scene with a twist — a potentially deadly one — introduces the warrior&rsquo;s story, though not the woman herself. It&rsquo;s the perfect entry point to the series, with the second book (<em>Amaskan&rsquo;s War</em>) due out in 2018, and a very satisfying read.
