<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/arts/international/robert-conquest-historian-who-documented-soviet-horrors-dies-at-98.html?_r=0">This <em>New York Times</em> obituary</a> for the Cold War historian makes him so easy to like. Conquest was a poet and a fan of science fiction, and he once responded to liberal criticism with a historical limerick:</p>

<p class="noindent">There was a great Marxist called Lenin<br>
Who did two or three million men in.<br>
Thatâ€™s a lot to have done in,<br>
But where he did one in<br>
That grand Marxist Stalin did ten in.</p>

<p class="noindent">Many have argued with Conquest's worldview, but nobody can argue that a limerick is a fine way to debate your critics.</p>
