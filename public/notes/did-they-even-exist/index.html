<p>If a tree falls in the woods<br>
And no one is there to hear it<br>
Does it even make a sound?</p>

<p>Alternative version:</p>

<p>If a police officer shoots a black kid<br>
and no one saw the bullet<br>
Is the black kid really dead?</p>

<p>If a white man goes on a killing spree is he a terrorist?<br>
Or mentally ill?<br>
Or a wolf in white skin?</p>

<p>If the black kid does not get a hashtag<br>
were they really killed?<br>
Are they worthy of mourning?</p>

<p>If no one knew the black kids name<br>
were they even a person<br>
or just a target?</p>

<p>If no one comes to the black kids funeral<br>
Is their mother still crying?</p>

<p>If the black kid does not make the evening news<br>
did they even<br>
exist?</p>
