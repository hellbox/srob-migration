<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Friday, December 29: Afternoon Book Group</strong></h5></p>
If you’re looking for some purpose for your post-Christmas week, maybe you should try joining this free book club at the Greenwood branch of the library. They’re going to be discussing the brilliant novel <em>Homegoing</em>, by Yaa Gyasi. There’s a lot to discuss in this book — and it’s relatively thin, too, meaning you’ll be able to read it in the days leading up to the book club. Go meet some folks who love books.
<em>Seattle Public Library, Greenwood Branch, 8016 Greenwood Ave N, <a href="http://spl.org">http://spl.org</a>, 2 pm, free.</em></p>
