<p>You&rsquo;re on a book review website, so the chances are good that you&rsquo;re occasionally just completely gobsmacked by the beauty of a word. Maybe you&rsquo;ve been astounded by the fact that a word like &ldquo;chair&rdquo; fits so perfectly with the idea of what a chair is and does. Or maybe you&rsquo;ve been suddenly taken with the idea of the word &ldquo;enormous&rdquo; - eee-NOR-mous! - to the extent that you force the word into strange new contexts.</p>

<p>Seattle playwright Y York&rsquo;s <em>The Impossibility of Now</em> (now playing at 12th Ave Arts on Capitol Hill) is all about words: the way they work, they way they don&rsquo;t. The way they delight us and sicken us and confound us and please us.</p>

<p>The premise is straight out of an Oliver Sacks book: a bestselling science writer named Carl (played with infectious exuberance by Terry Edward Moore) suffers a brain injury that renders him amnesiac. Carl&rsquo;s wife Miranda (Betsy Schwartz, quietly stunning in the least flashy role in the play), a poet, learns that Carl has a different relationship with words than he used to. Where once he ghostwrote biographies for astronauts and wrote scathing critiques of anthropologists, now he simply delights in the miracle of words: their sounds, their meanings, the way they look - which he envisions as a flurry of snowflakes drifting through the air.</p>

<p>As Carl wanders around his Las Vegas home, trying to remember his past life, Miranda has to deal with the shambles of their marriage from before Carl&rsquo;s accident. She&rsquo;s having a complicated affair with a dentist named Anthony (Joshua Carter, bringing dignity to a character who could be hopelessly tacky) but suddenly Carl doesn&rsquo;t at all resemble the Carl who made her so miserable. Where before he was withholding and unhappy, now Carl is joyful and content. He&rsquo;s eager to see his wife, and desperate to please her. Is it too late to turn the marriage around? Is it possible to find new meaning in the words they&rsquo;ve been using our whole lives?</p>

<p><em>The Impossibility of Now</em> is put on by local theater company Thalia&rsquo;s Umbrella, and it is an entirely captivating production. Everything from the costumes to the performances to the script is designed with a literary attention to detail. It&rsquo;s funny and touching and endearingly sweet - a thoughtful study of the way different people interact with language, and each other. Even if you&rsquo;re not a regular theater-goer, the book-lover in you will respond to this play on a deep emotional level.</p>

<p>There are three more performances in this run of <em>The Impossibility of Now</em> - this Friday night, Saturday afternoon at 2, and Saturday night. <a href="https://theimpossibilityofnow.brownpapertickets.com/">Tickets are still available</a>. Bring someone you love.</p>
