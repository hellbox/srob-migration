<p>I&rsquo;m not crazy about the title, but I like the cover a lot:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hillary Clinton&#39;s new book &quot;What Happened.&quot; will be released September 12, 2017. <a href="https://t.co/b22HvxGTO1">pic.twitter.com/b22HvxGTO1</a></p>&mdash; Anthony Dominic (@tmzanthony) <a href="https://twitter.com/tmzanthony/status/890574972497690624">July 27, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Will Clinton go on a book tour? Seems likely. Stay tuned!</p>
