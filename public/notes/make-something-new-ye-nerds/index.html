<p>I reviewed Ernest Cline&rsquo;s sci-fi novel <em>Ready Player One</em> on its release. I didn&rsquo;t like it. The book&rsquo;s boundless nostalgia for 80s nerd culture unsettled me on a deep level; hating the book kind of felt like self-loathing. In retrospect, I admit that my review of the book wasn&rsquo;t very good — I couldn&rsquo;t convey what I disliked about <em>Ready Player One</em> because I was wrestling with the issue of my generation&rsquo;s nostalgia on a personal level. So I&rsquo;m thrilled to see <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2015/07/armada_by_ernest_cline_follow_up_to_ready_player_one_reviewed.single.html">Laura Hudson&rsquo;s excellent review of Cline&rsquo;s second novel, <em>Armada</em></a>, because she exactly articulates my problem with Cline&rsquo;s writing in specific, and with my generation&rsquo;s propensity for nerd nostalgia in general. Feast your eyes:</p>

<blockquote>It's a valuable question for gaming culture—and “nerd culture” more generally—to ask itself: Do we want to tell stories that make sense of the things we used to love, that help us remember the reasons we were so drawn them, and create new works that inspire that level of devotion? Or do we simply want to hear the litany of our childhood repeated back to us like an endless lullaby for the rest of our lives?</blockquote>

<p><strong>Yes, yes yes!</strong> This is exactly what I wished I&rsquo;d said when I reviewed <em>Ready Player One</em>. Go read the whole review. And pity poor Hudson&rsquo;s Twitter replies feed; for the next few weeks, it&rsquo;s going to be full of angry nerds howling for her blood.</p>
