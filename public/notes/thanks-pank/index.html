<p>Literary Twitter — Lit-ter? — is at the moment (and rightfully) more than a little upset about the news that <a href="http://pankmagazine.com/">literary magazine <em>PANK</em></a> is going away.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I mean do y&#39;all know how many lit mags have black women as publishers? I just. I&#39;m gonna need a minute. This was always gonna hurt.</p>&mdash; Rahawa Haile (@RahawaHaile) <a href="https://twitter.com/RahawaHaile/status/626596315724648448">July 30, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>Literary magazines, for the most part, are short-lived creatures. They&rsquo;re born, they live within a certain time, and they&rsquo;re gone. The amount of surprise and shock <em>PANK</em>&rsquo;s shuttering has inspired is telling: we all thought that somehow, against all odds, it would last forever.</p>
