<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>It's Summertime and that means car trips with the kids! Both my rugrats love reading, and will happily while away the hours (that they're screen-restricted) with their nose in books. They're seven and ten right now. Any good suggestions for things to keep them happy and humming along so I can listen to my podcasts in peace, and have a bit of time to mess around setting up the tent without them whining that they have dirt in their sandals?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Bob,</p>

<p class="noindent">Fortunately for you, I have a 12-year-old sister and 10-year-old brother (the eggs in my family have a long shelf life). I made a vow when they were younger, and that vow was to buy them books for every major holiday and to never question the origins of their birth, even though – and I'm not being melodramatic here – they might actually be demons. </p>

<p>Look at the evidence: they both shot out of the womb cackling instead of crying, we had to file their teeth down to a congenial size (pity we couldn&rsquo;t do the same for their heads), and last Valentine&rsquo;s Day my brother gave me a homemade card that read: &ldquo;God has abandoned you. Love Max.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I do love them. They affectionately call me &ldquo;Spinster Queen,&rdquo; I affectionately call them human, and I have remained faithful to my vow, except for the Christmas I bought them a trampoline and rape whistles because their parents pissed me off.</p>

<p>Based on my experience, here are a few books your children might like: <em>Wonderstruck</em>, <em>The Book Thief</em>, the Captain Underpants series, and for your older child, anything by <a href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/artists/jason/">the Norwegian cartoonist Jason</a>, whose minimalist stories are especially well suited for road trips (be forewarned: his work is rather dark&hellip; I hear my siblings doing spit takes with holy water while reading it).</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
