      <div class="content">
        <p><strong>MONDAY</strong>: Elliott Bay Book Company hosts <em>Seattle Times</em> reporter James Neff, who debuts his new historical account, <em>Vendetta: Bobby Kennedy Versus Jimmy Hoffa</em>. This one’s got some good blurbs. Seymour Hersh says, “This is not a book about a good Bobby versus a bad Hoffa. It is a study of two men who always got what they wanted staging a shootout on the streets of Laredo. And, as Neff tells it, there were no winners.” And Erik Larson — <em>Devil in the White City</em> Erik Larson — calls it “a triumph of investigation and revelation.” That makes it well worth your time.</p>

<p><strong>TUESDAY</strong>: Might as well have a pajama party in Elliott Bay Book Company all night Monday night, because they’ve got the best reading of Tuesday, too. Lidia Yukanvitch, the brilliant Portland author of <em>Dora: A Headcase</em>, reads from her new novel, <em>The Small Backs of Children</em>.</p>

<p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong>: Ada’s Technical Books hosts a comic book reading with Anders Nilsen and Marc Bell. Bell presents his first “full-length graphic novella,” which seems like a weird designation — what is the fullest length a graphic novella can reach without hitting novel-size? For that matter, what’s the official size of a graphic novel? Anyway, in <em>Stroppy</em>, the protagonist “hopes to win big in a songwriting contest organized by the All-Star Schnauzer Band.” Nilsen, who has made some great comics including the terrific Charles Schulz-meets-Tolstoy bird epic <em>Big Questions</em>, celebrates the publication of a new collection of his sketchbooks. It’s titled <em>Poetry Is Useless</em>, which is a great title.</p>

<p><strong>THURSDAY</strong>:  Up at Ravenna Third Place, Jody Bower reads from her book <em>Jane Eyre&rsquo;s Sisters</em>, which “argues that Joseph Campbell&rsquo;s model of the hero&rsquo;s journey does not work for women.” Instead, Bower thinks books about female heroes “need a different model to do justice to a woman&rsquo;s experience of moving beyond the expectations of conventional societal roles to find her true, creative self.” This is a fascinating argument.</p>

<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong>: Back to Elliott Bay Book Company for a reading from Scott Dodson, who’ll read from his book <em>The Legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg</em>. Dodson’s book couldn’t be any better timed, now that the Notorious RGB has become a style icon.</p>

<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong>: No events today. You should probably set the day aside to either read <em>Go Set a Watchman</em>, which was released on Tuesday or — my preference — re-read <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, instead.</p>

<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong>: No readings today, either. It’s summer! Go read a book in the park. Recommend a book to a friend, and ask for a recommendation in return. Bury your face in the pages of a book and waggle your face around for a while.</p>
