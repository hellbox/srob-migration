        <p class="intro">**UPDATE**: Well, that was fast. We're sold out! If you're interested in a spot in our upcoming group of days, drop us a line on our [contact page](/about/), or mail us at _sponsorships @_ our domain.</p>

<p>When we launched the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>, we knew our sponsorship model was risky. It required training our readers that <em>advertising doesn&rsquo;t have to be horrible</em>, despite pretty much everything else you find on the internet.</p>

<p><strong>But our sponsorship model is working</strong>. It allows us to pay for the <a href="/reviews">reviews</a>, <a href="/tags/tuesday-poem/">poems</a>, and things like <a href="/notes/2016/03/01/remembering-elizabeth-eisenstein/">memorials</a> for <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/05/16/heroes-of-weirdness-in-honor-of-katherine-dunn/">writers</a> we love, and <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/04/notes-from-the-field-awp-wrap-up-the-day-after/">reporting from special events</a> you see here, and allows us to work on upcoming special projects you&rsquo;re going to love. This is all due to our sponsors, and due to our readers checking each sponsor out, and giving them a fair shake.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re about to release our next block of openings, for August to January, and before we do that, we&rsquo;d love to clear the last four slots we have remaining in June and July.
* We made two slots $100 ($50 off!)
* We made two slots $125 ($25 off!)</p>

<p>Find out <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">more on our Sponsorship page</a>, and <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">view the open dates here</a>. First come first served, and once they&rsquo;re gone, they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
