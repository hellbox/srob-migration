<p><strong>MONDAY</strong> Our week begins at <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/tom-janikowski-elissa-washuta-amaranth-borsuk-patrick-milan">Elliott Bay Book Company</a>, where the wonderful independent publisher Red Hen Press presents a group reading with Tom Janikowski,Amaranth Borsuk, and Patrick Milan. They’ll all read from their most recent titles. But this reading also features local author Elissa Washuta, author of <em>My Body is a Book of Rules</em> and, most recently,  <em>Starvation Mode</em>. (You can <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-perpetual-naked-lunch-of-starvation-mode/">read my review of the latter right here</a>.) A reading from Washuta alone is reason to show up, but tonight you’ll get to see three other writers and support a fantastic small press.</p>

<p><strong>TUESDAY</strong> It’s back to Elliott Bay Book Company for a 7 pm reading co-presented with Hedgebrook. Naomi Jackson presents her debut novel <em>The Star Side of Bird Hill</em>, about young sisters who move from Brooklyn to the Caribbean, where their grandmother lives. Jackson will appear with local poet Anastacia Tolbert, who <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/25/rattail/">graced the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> with a wonderful poem last Tuesday</a>.</p>

<p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong> Up at <a href="http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/lfp-bicycle-built-two-billion-jamie-bianchini">Third Place Books in Lake Forest Park</a>, Jamie Bianchini reads from <em>A Bicycle Built for Two Billion</em>, his account of riding around the world on a tandem bike. On his trip, Bianchini visited 81 countries in 7 years. He’s got a lot of stories from that experience and, presumably, he’s got a nice pair of legs to show for it, too.</p>

<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1440817374706/9781452144160_350.jpg" alt="" /></p><strong>THURSDAY</strong> At <a href="http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/ravenna-frida-clements-have-little-pun">Third Place Books Ravenna</a>, local artist Frida Clements reads from her book <em>Have a Little Pun</em>, which is a collection of illustrated puns, leaning heavily on the animal side of the pun spectrum. The promo copy for this event reads: “Having a bad hare day? Feeling a little antsy? What the hail, just dill with it, and for fox sake, have a little pun.” Just reading that will probably help you determine if this event is for you or not.</p>

<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong> Ada’s Technical Books presents <a href="http://www.seattletechnicalbooks.com/max-connect">a different kind of writing event</a>: the software company Cycling ’74 presents a reception and demonstration celebrating an updated version of their programming language, Max 7. There will also, reportedly be “swag.”</p>

<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong> <a href="http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=09&amp;evyear=2015&amp;eventid=2015070909304900&amp;pre=20150901&amp;pst=20150913">University Book Store</a> presents Portland author Michael McGregor, author of <em>Pure Act</em>, which is a biography of minimalist poet Robert Lax. How minimalist? I’ll let <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lax">Wikipedia spell it out</a>: “Over the years the poems became more and more minimalist, sometimes consisting of single words, even single syllables, running down page after page, often in varying colors.”</p>

<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong> <a href="http://hugohouse.org/event/moss-volume-1-celebration-rebecca-brown-matt-briggs-janie-miller-and-miriam-cook/">Hugo House hosts</a> the very first party for the gorgeous <a href="http://www.mosslit.com/vol01/issue03.html">local online literary magazine <em>Moss</em></a>. Co-founders Connor Guy and Alex Davis-Lawrence will host, present four awesome readers (Rebecca Brown, Matt Briggs, Janie Miller, and Miriam Cook,) and talk about the future of <em>Moss</em>, which will involve a physical manifestation. This is the book party of the week, without question.</p>
