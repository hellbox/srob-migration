        <p>The wonderful <a href="http://entreriosbooks.com">Entre Ríos Books</a> is back as a sponsor, with their stunning book <em>Twelve Saints</em>. The work combines poems about twelve saints with collages built from tintype photographs. The effect is somehow both ethereal and concrete, and aesthetically it is absolutely gorgeous. We have a sample spread on our <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships">sponsor&rsquo;s page</a>. The book is reasonably priced, for such a beautiful work, and available at many locations in town, as well as on the Entre Ríos website.</p>

<p>Entre Ríos took advantage of our sponsorship program &mdash; <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">new dates are now available through the Summer</a>. If you&rsquo;re a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">take a look at our open dates</a>. Don&rsquo;t wait too long &mdash; we sold our last six month block out!</p>
