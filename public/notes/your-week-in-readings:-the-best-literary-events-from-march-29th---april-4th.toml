<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday March 29th: The State of Arts Criticism in Seattle
**</h5></p> 
Doug McLennan, the founder of *Arts Journal*, talks with a panel of local critics including theater critic Misha Berson, the *Seattle Times*’s Brendan Kiley, former *Seattle Weekly* editor David Brewster, and, uh, me. We’ll be discussing why art criticism is being cut from local papers and why it’s currently in the hands of mostly middle aged white people.
*Folio: The Seattle Athenaem, 324 Marion St., 402-4612, http://folioseattle.org. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Alternate Wednesday March 29th: *Burning Bright* Reading**</h5></p> 
Thriller author Nick Petrie continues his series starring “damaged war veteran Peter Ash.” Petrie lives in Milwaukee, but he is a graduate of the University of Washington MFA fiction program, making this reading something of a homecoming. “Peter Ash” is a pretty great name for a thriller star — right up there with “Remo Williams” or “Lincoln Rhyme.”
*Third Place Books Lake Forest Park, 17171 Bothell Way NE, 366-3333, http://thirdplacebooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*

 
<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday March 30th: *Up South* Launch Party**</h5></p> 
Robert Lashley is one of the most powerful poets in the region. If you haven’t seen him read, you owe it to yourself to attend this debut for his second collection of poems: when the man reads, you have to pay attention. And when you pay attention, you’re rewarded with something new and beautiful.
*Jack Straw Gallery, 4261 Roosevelt Way N.E., 634-0919, http://jackstraw.org .  Free. All ages. 7 p.m.* 
 
<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday March 31st: Kimberly Burwick and Kevin Goodan**</h5></p> 
Under the guidance of new owner Billie Swift, Open Books has really accelerated their reading series schedule, bringing both locally known and unknown poets to their stage. It would be a mistake to call Burwick and Goodan “unknown,” though. Burwick is an eastern Washingtonian and Goodan is from Montana, and they’re both widely read.
*Open Books, 2414 N. 45th St., 633-0811, http://openpoetrybooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*

 <p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday April 2nd: Punk Rock Prose**</h5></p> 
Fantagraphics Bookstore & Gallery, which shares space with a record store, hosts a rare prose-book event. A trio of authors who did time as punk rockers in Seattle — Danny Bland, Tom Hansen, and Jonathan Evison — welcome author Brian Jabas Smith, who’ll read from his new short story collection *Spent Saints & Other Stories*.

 *Fantagraphics Bookstore & Gallery, 925 E. Pike St., 658-0110, http://fantagraphics.com/flog/bookstore. Free. All ages. 3 p.m. * 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday April 3rd: *The Twelve Lives of Samuel Hawley* Reading**</h5></p> 
 Fiction author Hannah Tinti’s new novel, *The Twelve Lives of Samuel Hawley*, is partially based on Whidbey Island. It in part references the Hercules myth. Tinti will be joined by Seattle novelist Laurie Frankel, whose *This Is How It Always Is* has been one of the most enjoyable reading experiences of my year so far. 
*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*
