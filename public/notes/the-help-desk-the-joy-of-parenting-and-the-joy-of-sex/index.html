<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m a single dad and my ten-year-old daughter apparently found my copy of <em>Story of O</em>. She confessed after I found her posing Barbie over Ken&rsquo;s lap for a spanking. How the heck am I supposed to explain something as complex as power fantasies to her, or at the very least help her from seeing her dad as a big creep?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Ermine,</p>

<p>Awhile ago I met a nice Christian woman who believes sex before marriage is amoral but regularly masturbates her male dog before competitions because she says it relaxes him. I asked, but no: she is not married to her dog.</p>

<p>My point is people compartmentalize sex in individually weird ways. Reading <em>Story of O</em> doesn’t make your daughter damaged or you a creep – in my book, nothing short of competitively masturbating your pet in public while praying for the salvation of sluts does.</p>

<p>It’s not your job to explain power fantasies to your daughter. It’s your job to buy her ice cream and tell her that what she read was fiction and a bit above her reading level. Then, it’s your parental duty to purchase a copy of <em>The Joy of Sex</em> and give it to a cool female friend to give to your daughter (trust me, no young woman wants to get a sex manual from her dad). My grandmother bought me the <em>Joy of Sex</em> when I was about 10 and once I got over the horror of being handed a sex thing by a near dead thing, I treasured it (sex ed in Idaho in the 90s doubled as our “Faces of Meth” campaign). Hopefully your daughter will stop snooping through your erotica as she practices hundreds of new positions to put Barbie and Ken in, all while developing an appreciation for diverse body types and prize-winning bushes.</p>

<p>Just keep her away from your dog.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
