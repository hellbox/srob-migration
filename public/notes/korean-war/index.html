<p>You are the North and I am the South.<br>
My tanks aim for you. I shoot you a thousand times.</p>

<p>Your missiles launch into my oceans. You raise monuments to scorn me.<br>
You eat clams cooked in gasoline.</p>

<p>I drink milk and cider. I raise skyscrapers of businessmen.<br>
You build towers of empty rooms. You refuse me from where I am most loved.</p>

<p>I clean a wintermelon of its guts and seeds cling to my wet fingers.<br>
Aren’t you the North, and I the South?</p>

<p>Phantom, disease, you’re trembling. There is no patience in my country.<br>
There is no safest place in yours.</p>

<p>The heart stiffens at the sound of church bells. I wonder where you sleep now.<br>
You are the North and I am the South.</p>

<p>I cannot see the sky beyond the ceiling.<br>
I cannot forgive you for cutting me out.</p>

<p>I see all my ground, and you, walking over me—before you were<br>
the North and I was the South.</p>

<p>A photographer captures a mass execution on film.<br>
Men and women tied to posts, blindfolded—Korean spies.</p>

<p>The man nearest to the camera fiddles with his blindfold<br>
until it rests comfortably over his eyes.</p>
