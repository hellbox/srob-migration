<p>When it comes to Spider-Man, you&rsquo;re either a fan of the Ditko take on the character, or you prefer John Romita. Ditko, of course, created Spider-Man — with some assistance from Stan Lee — but Romita took over the series from Ditko and codified it into the Spider-Man we know today.</p>

<p>It breaks down like this: Ditko&rsquo;s art is weird and a little off-putting and gorgeous. Romita&rsquo;s lines are much cleaner and less complex and more outright heroic. Ditko&rsquo;s version of Peter Parker sulks off to the side of his schoolyard while everyone else socializes. Romita&rsquo;s version is much more mainstream and friendly. Ditko&rsquo;s Spider-Man was paranoid and weird and always in danger of getting angry and hurting someone. Romita&rsquo;s Spider-Man is on all the licensed Underoos and bedsheets, as unthreatening in his own way as Mickey Mouse.</p>

<p>You can probably tell from my description where I stand. I much prefer Ditko&rsquo;s take on Spider-Man, which feels to me like a more realistic portrayal of adolescence. The teen years are lumpy and awkward and infuriating, and Spider-Man should reflect that.</p>

<p>By far, the two best Spider-Man movies to date are Sam Raimi&rsquo;s <em>Spider-Man 2</em> starring Tobey Maguire and the new <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em>, which opens tonight in theaters everywhere and stars Tom Holland. Of those two, I prefer Raimi&rsquo;s edition, which to me more accurately reflects Ditko&rsquo;s take on the character. Maguire was a mildly creepy Spider-Man; he always had a bit of a leer on his face, and he felt more dangerous than cuddly.</p>

<p>But if you like the Romita Spider-Man, odds are good that <em>Homecoming</em> might be your favorite Spider-Man flick yet. And you&rsquo;d have good reason to fall for it. This is a funny, entertaining, thrilling superhero movie with great performances anchored by a stellar Tom Holland, and some of the best direction we&rsquo;ve seen in a Marvel movie.</p>

<p>Jon Watts, who previously only had one movie — the pulpy thriller <em>Cop Car</em> — to his name, does incredible work here. Watts isn&rsquo;t afraid of pulling the camera waaaaaaaaaaayyyyy back and giving us a long shot, say, of Spider-Man running down a street, or of him goofing around with his webs, or of Peter Parker walking down the hallway of his high school for gifted and talented students. Watts allows things to look a little mundane, which is smart: it humanizes Spider-Man and puts him on our level. We can&rsquo;t help but root for him.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give away too much of what little there is of the plot, but suffice it to say we don&rsquo;t dwell on origin stories here. Instead, we just follow Peter Parker around on a few important days in his life, and we watch as he interacts with his hero Tony Stark and a birdlike villain played by former Birdman Michael Keaton. The set pieces are suitably big but happily lower-stakes than most superhero films. (Only the last action sequence falls prey to the too-many-blurry-closeups school of superhero storytelling, and even then the film manages to stop itself before it goes too far down that road.)</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see some folks try to claim that <em>Homecoming</em> is a tribute to John Hughes movies, but that&rsquo;s stretching it. While the film does focus on the relationships between Peter Parker&rsquo;s peer group (say that five times fast), it&rsquo;s by no means a romance, or a quiet, character-driven story. Instead, it deepens and investigates the Marvel Universe&rsquo;s impact on ground-level citizens in a meaningful way. Keaton&rsquo;s bad guy has an honor to him, and though he&rsquo;s not as fully developed as Alfred Molina&rsquo;s Doctor Octopus was in <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, he&rsquo;s certainly one of the better Marvel villains.</p>

<p>But while the film has at least one huge homage to a Ditko moment, it&rsquo;s Romita Spider-Man through-and-through. Parker is portrayed as a nerd, but aside from one comic-relief bully, you get the sense that he&rsquo;s still respected by his classmates. His relationship with his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei, wildly charming) is healthy. He doesn&rsquo;t feel like too much of a freak when he teams up with other superheroes. (Remember, Ditko&rsquo;s Spider-Man tried to join the Fantastic Four in his first issue, but when he found out that they didn&rsquo;t pay well, he threw a hissy fit and acted in an otherwise very unheroic manner.)</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t super-impressed with the last few superhero pilot outings from Marvel. I thought both <em>Ant-Man</em> and <em>Doctor Strange</em> were perfectly respectable, if relatively bland, outings. <em>Homecoming</em> is much better than both those films, though it does certainly feel like yet another installment in a never-ending story.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s okay, though. Whichever Spider-Man you prefer, Ditko&rsquo;s or Romita&rsquo;s, you have to admit that both are well-crafted comics. It&rsquo;s kind of the same thing here: after a dry spell of three bad movies, it&rsquo;s heartening to see a talented group of artists get their hands on the character again. Even if this Spider-Man is a little too friendly for your liking, you have to at least love him a little bit.</p>
