        <p>Jason Weisberger <a href="http://boingboing.net/2016/07/12/vandals-wage-war-on-san-franci.html">writes about</a> a San Francisco Little Free Library that was targeted by some vandals. This is, of course, outrageous and I&rsquo;m glad they keep putting the Library back up.</p>

<p>However, I have noticed that we&rsquo;ve seen a flood of Little Free Libraries in Seattle over the last year and a half, and I must say that <strong>the quality of books in those libraries has markedly decreased</strong>, with a lot of magazines, hopelessly battered paperbacks and dated technical books popping up all around town.</p>

<p>I think, and I do not have any data to back this up, the problem is that perhaps there are <strong>too many Little Free Libraries in Seattle</strong>? The quantity of Libraries is perhaps finally outstripping the quality of their stock.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d invite anyone considering launching a Little Free Library of their own to investigate the situation in their neighborhood — if there&rsquo;s another Library five or six blocks away from your home, maybe you should just work as hard as you can to contribute to the pre-existing one? After all, as <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/26/the-help-desk-my-local-little-free-library-is-a-disaster/">Cienna Madrid pointed out</a> back in February, it takes a community to raise a Little Free Library.</p>
