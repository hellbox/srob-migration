<p>Yes. <a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/readers-perceive-question-based-headlines-more-negatively-study-shows/s2/a663096/">God, yes</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Question-based headlines prompt a more negative response from readers as well as a more negative expectation of the story that follows compared to traditional news headlines, showed a report published on 9 August by the Engaging News Project.</blockquote>

<p>Remember the rule of thumb: if the headline is a question, the answer is almost always &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Headline writing has, in recent years, transformed from an art form — a good headline is a piece of writing that communicates with the piece as well as promoting the piece — into an impossibly dry chunk of information.</p>

<p>Why did it change? Well, social media. Headlines have to be designed to grab people on Facebook, which means you can&rsquo;t write a headline with the assumption that someone will read the attached story. (Ask anyone who works in social media and you&rsquo;ll learn that a disturbing number of people on Facebook like and share articles based solely on the information available in the headline. You and I, of course, would <em>never</em> do that.) So question headlines are seen as best, because they provide information, but they aslo force you to click through to see what the answer to the question is.</p>

<p>Of course, anyone with half a brain could predict that news consumers were going to get sick of being played like that. And so now <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/technology/facebook-moves-to-push-clickbait-lower-in-the-news-feed.html?_r=0">Facebook has declared war on clickbait</a> and publishers risk <a href="http://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/07/facing-the-new-facebook-reality-the-numbers-behind-the-fright-004662">losing even more eyeballs</a>. Could this be the end of question headlines? (I refer you to the rule of thumb in the third paragraph for the answer to this question.)</p>
