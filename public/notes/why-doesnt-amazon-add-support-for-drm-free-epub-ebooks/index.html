<p>The eBook Reader blog wonders:</p>

<blockquote><p>Kindle ereaders are one of the few reading devices on the planet that don’t support ePub format.</p>

<p>Kindles are the most popular dedicated readers and ePub is the most common ebook format, so what gives?</p>

<p>Why doesn’t Amazon add support for ePub ebooks to Kindles?</p></blockquote>

<p>I guess this could be a rhetorical question, but the answer is ridiculously obvious: because Amazon doesn&rsquo;t want to open its system up or allow people to read e-books that they&rsquo;ve bought in other places. If you&rsquo;re buying an Amazon e-reader, you&rsquo;re buying into Amazon&rsquo;s system. That deal is never, ever, ever going to change. If you expect Amazon to open their system up because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do, or because their customers would prefer to have one e-book library rather than a confusing mess of proprietary formats, you&rsquo;re going to be waiting for a very long time. It&rsquo;ll never happen.</p>
