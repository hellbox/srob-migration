<p>Sad news: Jessa Crispin, founder of the popular book blog Bookslut, <a href="https://twitter.com/thebookslut/status/707566403981717509">announced on Twitter that she&rsquo;s shutting down the blog</a> after 14 years. Bookslut was one of the very first book blogs I ever read, along with the late, lamented Bookninja, and it was hugely influential for me. (I sent a terrible pitch to them when I was just starting out and, thankfully, never received a response.) If you&rsquo;ve never read Bookslut, I encourage you to <a href="http://bookslut.com/">go check it out</a>; all the issues are archived, providing a kind of literary time capsule as far back as <a href="http://www.bookslut.com/2002_05.php">May of 2002</a>.</p>
