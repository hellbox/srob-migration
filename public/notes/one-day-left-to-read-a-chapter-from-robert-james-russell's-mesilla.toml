Through Sunday, our sponsor Robert James Russell is allowing us run a chapter from his upcoming western _Mesilla_, being released by Seattle's own Dock Street Press. It's a real treat, and one you won't want to miss. 

<blockquote>
He unwound a piece of stained red cloth from around the upper part of his left thigh and he dropped the saturated tourniquet into a soaked pile beside him. He took two fingers and tore open his trousers and beneath the breach lay a bullet wound that fizzled deep, the skin encircling the wound lipped out as if it had been disturbed by some plated tremor deep below. He thumbed at it curiously as if he had familiarities with human anatomy then recoiled from the shocks of pain that shot back. He coughed and cleared his throat and squinted his eyes at the hole, imagining he could see the top of the stunted round glistening, and he wished he had dug the thing out in San Agustin when heâ€™d had the chance.
