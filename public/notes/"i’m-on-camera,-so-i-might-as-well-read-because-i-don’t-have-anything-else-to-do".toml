Kara Brown's interview with [Johari Osayi Idusuyi](http://theslot.jezebel.com/a-conversation-with-johari-osayi-idusuyi-the-hero-who-1742082010), the woman who read *Citizen* at a Trump rally and thereby [became an instant celebrity](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/11/trolling-trump-with-reading/), wins the internet today.
