The library will be closed for several months for renovations.</p></li>

<li><p>Here&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.artsandcraftspress.com/">Yoshiko Yamamoto</a>&rsquo;s poster for this year&rsquo;s Seattle Antiquarian Book Fair, which happens at Seattle Center on October 15th and 16th:</p></li>

<li><p>Spokane&rsquo;s alternative weekly newspaper the <em>Inlander</em> has <a href="http://www.inlander.com/spokane/ArticleArchives?category=2974760">published a special poetry issue</a>. If you love Northwest poetry, you need to check it out.</p></li>

<li><p>Rob Liefeld&rsquo;s ghastly Extreme Comics characters, many of which were published during the creatively bankrupt 1990s superhero comics glut that nearly destroyed the comics industry, have been <a href="http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2017/01/03/rob-liefelds-extreme-universe-is-headed-to-the-big-screen">optioned for a shared universe of superhero movies</a>. I can&rsquo;t think of a better symbol for the oncoming superhero movie malaise than this dispiriting piece of news.</p></li>

<li><p>Now that garbage human <a href="http://www.vox.com/culture/2017/1/3/14119080/milo-yiannopoulos-book-deal-simon-schuster-dangerous-boycott">Milo Yiannopoulos has signed a book deal fora quarter of a million dollars</a>, maybe Yiannopoulos will finally pay out that $100,000 in scholarships for white men that he raised last year? <a href="https://mic.com/articles/163789/milo-yiannopoulos-raised-100-000-in-charity-for-white-boys-he-still-hasn-t-paid-it-out#.Wq4uTUSgI">Jack Smith IV at Mic</a> reports that the scholarship hasn&rsquo;t benefitted a single student:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>The money, however, has disappeared down a rabbit hole of private bank accounts and apparent shell companies registered to the same address in London. Almost a year since the fund's launch, Yiannopoulos is, for his part, reacting in a manner consistent with previous concerns around the fund's handling: by claiming paperwork for the fund is being processed and that the money will be disbursed at a later date.</blockquote>

<li><p>Medium, the blogging service that has rapidly become both a popular longread supplement to Twitter and blog hosting platform for sites including The Awl and ThinkProgress, <a href="https://blog.medium.com/renewing-mediums-focus-98f374a960be#.ghr7w729c">announced massive layoffs and office closures</a> today. Seems they still don&rsquo;t know how to monetize words on the internet. And founder Ev Williams says the service is considering new ways to pay writers for their work, but his comments are so vague that they should provide absolutely no consolation for writers anywhere. Williams writes, &ldquo;It is too soon to say exactly what this will look like. This strategy is more focused but also less proven.&rdquo; I take this as Silicon Valley-ese for &ldquo;we have no idea what we&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p></li>
