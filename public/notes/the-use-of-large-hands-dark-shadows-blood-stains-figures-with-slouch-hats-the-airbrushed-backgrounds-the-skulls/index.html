<p>Is it presumptuous to say that book covers are on the whole better now — more attractive, more informative, less clichéd — than at any other time in history? I believe that to be true, but I&rsquo;m probably setting myself up for some epic arguments in the near future. Still, <a href="http://www.printmag.com/daily-heller/a-life-in-paperbacks-h-lawrence-hoffman/">this retrospective on the life and work of H. Lawrence Hoffman</a> inspires no small amount of nostalgia for the boom days of paperback books. Nobody is making anything quite like Hoffman&rsquo;s covers anymore, and that&rsquo;s kind of a shame. They&rsquo;re a little gaudy, sure, but they&rsquo;re great fun. I especially like the cover for <em>FOG</em>.</p>
