_Catherine's Pascha_, written by this week's sponsor Charlotte Riggle and illustrated by R.J. Hughes, is about a girl's determination to stay awake for Pascha. In the Orthodox Christian church, Easter services are held in the middle of the night. It's a story of a girl's coming of age in the culture of her family, and learning about tradition and faith.

Charlotte will be appearing March 11th at A Good Book Cafe in Sumner for a Kid's Night in the Bookstore, for snacks, a reading, and a lights out tour of the store with flashlights. Only twenty slots are availble.
