<p>The Academy (as in, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to thank the&hellip;&rdquo;) posted this interactive interview with screenwriter <a href="http://johnaugust.com" title="A ton of useful information about screenwriting from screenwriter John August">John August</a>. It&rsquo;s hard to think of a better advocate for screenwriters than he. Not only has he been answering questions from readers on his blog since for at least fifteen years (well before he was as well-known as he is now), but after falling in hate with the biggest screenwriting software out there, he helped to create an open source plaintext screenwriting standard called <a href="http://fountain.io" title="Fountain | A markup language for screenwriting.">Fountain</a>, and then he started a <a href="http://quoteunquoteapps.com" title="Quote-Unquote Apps">software company</a> to make software to utilize it. Oh yeah, then there&rsquo;s his popular <a href="http://johnaugust.com/scriptnotes" title="John August and Craig Mazin discuss screenwriting and things that are interesting to screenwriters">ad-free podcast</a>, and his other little products like <a href="http://www.writeremergency.com" title="Writer Emergency">Writer&rsquo;s Emergency Pack</a>. Unlike other movie writing coaches, he is someone who talks from experience and success, and is always straight-forward and generous with his message.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed, in the past few years, more and more fiction writers taking in the lessons of story from Hollywood. Even if you&rsquo;re writing novels, or curious how a good story is crafted, there is a lot to learn from people like August, and watching his career has been an absolute hoot.</p>
