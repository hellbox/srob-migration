<p>Toward the end of Bethany Jean Clement&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/life/food-drink/bauhaus-green-lake-closes-ballard-branch-reportedly-to-follow/"><em>Seattle Times</em> scoop</a> about the sudden and mysterious closure of the Bauhaus coffee mini-chain, there&rsquo;s this additional terrible news:</p>

<blockquote>And Twice Sold Tales in Ballard [posted on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10153410672558871&id=132445238870): “Bauhaus Ballard, which my bookstore subleases from, is closing. I was just told, and told that their last day is Sunday. As yet, **I have no idea how long I’ve got to move out or where I’m going to go**.”</blockquote>

<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping Twice Sold Tales can find some sort of an agreement to stay in the space. If you haven&rsquo;t been yet, it&rsquo;s a wonderful little bookshop, cramped in all the right ways and packed full of some wonderful weird stuff. Stop by and show your support if you&rsquo;re in the neighborhood.</p>
