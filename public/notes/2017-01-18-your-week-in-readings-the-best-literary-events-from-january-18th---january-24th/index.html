        <p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Wednesday January 18th: WordsWest 22</strong></h5></p>
West Seattle’s liveliest reading series begins 2017 with Hugo House Writer-in-Residence Anastacia Renee Tolbert and Seattle Times reporter Claudia Rowe, whose brand-new true crime book <em>The Spider and the Fly</em> tells the true story of her correspondence with a serial killer. The two writers will read on the theme of “dreams deferred.”

Visiting author Emily Robbins’s debut novel<em>A Word for Love</em> is about an exchange student who travels to Syria, falls in love with the language, and then falls in love with a Syrian.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Friday January 20th: Occupy Inauguration</strong></h5></p>
 Technically this isn’t a reading, but the truth is, the We Defy event with Sherman Alexie and Ijeoma Oluo at Town Hall tonight is already sold out (though they do often have standby tickets at the door if you feel like waiting in line) and tonight is a night for political action. Go be heard.

<h5><strong>Sunday January 22nd: <em>Looking for Betty MacDonald</em> Reading</strong></h5></p> Betty MacDonald’s 1945 memoir about life on the Olympic Peninsula, <em>The Egg and I</em>, is an underappreciated Northwest classic. Seattle-area historian Paula Becker celebrates the UW Press’s republication of three long out-of-print books by MacDonald with a reading from her book which celebrates MacDonald’s history and legacy.

Today, she debuts her new book, <em>The Revolution Where You Live: Stories from a 12,000 Mile Journey Through a New America</em>. Hopefully, she has some ideas for a new form of activism.

<p><h5><strong>Tuesday January 24th: <em>This Is How It Always Is</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
 No less a towering talent than the Northwest’s own Ruth Ozeki praises Seattle author Laurie Frankel’s third novel, <em>This Is How It Always Is</em>, for charging us “to look beyond the traditional binary oppositions of boy vs. girl, right vs. wrong, real vs. make-believe, and to find courage and beauty in the in-between.”
