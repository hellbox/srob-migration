<p>Dalya Alberge writes at <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/16/what-orson-welles-really-thought-about-ernest-hemingway"><em>The Guardian</em></a> that a recently uncovered manuscript co-authored by Orson Welles reveals some truths about the friendship between Ernest Hemingway and Welles:</p>

<blockquote>The manuscript, presented in a new study on Welles, reflects his disdain for a type of macho tourist frequently spotted in Spain when mass travel to the country took off in the 1960s. Intended to form the basis of of a love-triangle drama, the script features an American bullfighting aficionado, clearly inspired by Hemingway, as the lead character.</blockquote>

<p>The draft, titled <em>Crazy Weather</em>, can be found at the University of Michigan. Speaking as someone who feels very uneasy about Hemingway&rsquo;s brand of machismo, I hope it gets published sometime soon.</p>
