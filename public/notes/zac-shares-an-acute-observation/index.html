<p>From the other-sided, alee the valley; to give what you want &mdash;<br>
says the mentor, irreparably. As pretense gets wrecked like a<br>
photograph. As we haunt eternally.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell.<br>
Do we?</p>

<p>Cold guy drifts in cold veins, this nightly swim.<br>
So I overheard in LA, grab a shovel, LA is dead.<br>
<em>Nothing is Real</em>. Lame,</p>

<p>I know. Ask if there&rsquo;s proof.<br>
Of life, if not for death&rsquo;s warming the carpet living room.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m officially bored with weed,<br>
as if a backpack with nothing in it. As if I hope the world is done<br>
sleeping in synchronicities.</p>

<p>Are there heavenly capillaries networking? Blacked-out to neon.<br>
Who is recording<br>
our untitled hallucinations: washed up on the amethystine sea he plunged,</p>

<p>and what of the notes nailed to the roof with a gun? Days of<br>
noise funneling into the hollows<br>
of my hips. A lot of beating hearts out there. As they say, <em>imitation</em><br>
<em>is suicide</em>, you lowlife.</p>
