<p>Gene Balk, the <em>Seattle Times</em>&rsquo;s excellent &ldquo;FYI Guy,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/library-visits-drop-but-digital-use-soars/">reported over the weekend</a> that &ldquo;Between 2011 and 2014, branch visits to Seattle Public Library declined by about 150,000 â€“ even as branch hours were added.&rdquo; Visits are especially down in the city&rsquo;s lowest-income neighborhoods, for unclear reasons. Circulation of digital materials, however, is way up.</p>

<p>Could the lack of visits have to do with <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/26/an-open-letter-to-the-seattle-public-library-board-of-trustees-about-spls-anti-book-agenda/">SPL leadership&rsquo;s &ldquo;anti-book&rdquo; agenda</a>? Considering that many of Seattle&rsquo;s independent booksellers saw record sales during the same years that SPL&rsquo;s visits declined, an anti-book agenda probably isn&rsquo;t helping matters.</p>
