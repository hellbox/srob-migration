<li><p>I&rsquo;m already getting excited to introduce David Sedaris when he reads at Benaroya Hall on Wednesday, November 16th. (<a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/16/why-a-dog-owner-in-maine-doesnt-like-david-sedaris/">Here&rsquo;s last year&rsquo;s introduction.</a>) If you&rsquo;re at all interested in attending this reading, you should know that <a href="https://cart.seattlesymphony.org/single/SYOS.aspx?p=18398">tickets are on sale now</a>, and they usually sell out very early. I attend a lot of readings, and I can tell you that Sedaris is the best reader I&rsquo;ve ever seen. He also sticks around and signs everyone&rsquo;s books before and after the reading, taking the time to have a personal conversation with everyone in line. I hope to see you in November.</p></li>

<li><p>Video of Lesley Hazleton&rsquo;s TED Talk about soul isn&rsquo;t available online yet, but <a href="http://blog.ted.com/a-meditation-on-the-soul-lesley-hazelton-at-tedsummit/">this account of her recent talk</a> certainly has us intrigued — especially the bit where she describes fundamentalists:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>“It’s not that they have no soul, it’s that something in them seems to have shriveled. They’ve hunkered down and built a wall inside themselves. afraid of the unknown. They live walled off from the world.”</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Seattle cartoonist Tatiana Gill just published <a href="http://www.tatianagill.com/portfolio/my-body-positive-journey">an autobiographical comic titled &ldquo;My Body Positive Journey&rdquo; to her website</a>. It&rsquo;s all about the long journey of coming to peace with yourself. I reviewed <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/drink-to-forget-ink-to-remember/">a few of Gill&rsquo;s autobiographical comics</a> back in November; if you like this comic, you should consider buying one of her published works.</p></li>

<li><p>What common thread unites Man Booker Prize winners? You can filter out the winners using <a href="http://www.flipsnack.com/booker-prize/">this interactive infographic</a>, but the answer, unfortunately, is &ldquo;they&rsquo;re men writing books about men.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>I often use the <em>New York Times Book Review</em> as an example of the kind of stodgy, establishment-friendly book reviews that we don&rsquo;t try to write at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>. So it&rsquo;s only fair that I share a <em>NYTBR</em> piece that absolutely knocks it out of the park: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/books/jonah-lehrer-a-book-about-love-review.html">Jennifer Senior&rsquo;s review of serial plagiarist Jonah Lehrer&rsquo;s <em>A Book About Love</em></a> is that rarest of reviews: the generous takedown. You get the sense in reading the review that Senior gives Lehrer multiple opportunities to prove himself, but he disappoints her at every opportunity. Senior&rsquo;s review is intelligent, dramatic, funny, and never cruel for cruelty&rsquo;s sake. It&rsquo;s the best review I&rsquo;ve read at the <em>Times</em> in years. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/books/jonah-lehrer-a-book-about-love-review.html">You should read it</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>The intense-sounding <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601848/data-mining-reveals-the-six-basic-emotional-arcs-of-storytelling/">Computational Story Laboratory</a> has pulled apart and analyzed novels and identified the &ldquo;Six Basic Emotional Arcs of Storytelling.&rdquo; This is intrinsically interesting stuff, although one can picture Hollywood immediately turning it into a shitty formula for screenwriting, the way the work of Joseph Campbell has been twisted into a bad story factory. Anyway, those six arcs are:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>A steady, ongoing rise in emotional valence, as in a rags-to-riches story such as *Alice’s Adventures Underground* by Lewis Carroll. A steady ongoing fall in emotional valence, as in a tragedy such as *Romeo and Juliet*. A fall then a rise, such as the man-in-a-hole story, discussed by [story-mapper and novelist Kurt] Vonnegut. A rise then a fall, such as the Greek myth of Icarus. Rise-fall-rise, such as Cinderella. Fall-rise-fall, such as Oedipus.</blockquote>
