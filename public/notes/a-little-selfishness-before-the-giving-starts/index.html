<p>It&rsquo;s almost time for holiday shopping. But before we get down to the arduousness of — ugh — <em>buying books for other people</em>, you should visit <a href="http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/">Third Place Books</a> and Third Place Books Ravenna this weekend. On Saturday and Sunday, all used books in both locations are 40 percent off. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite book sales of the year, and a great chance to get some selfish book-buying done before it&rsquo;s time to start thinking of other people again.</p>
