<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>As a bookseller, I was jealous of [the San Francisco bookstore that refused to carry or order Milo Yiannopoulos’s book for customers](http://sfist.com/2017/01/11/milo_yiannopoulos_booksmith_simon_s.php). My bookstore won’t do the same, no matter how hard my coworkers and I plead to the owners. In fact, it’s not even that they won’t ban the book; they want to have a couple copies on the shelf for people to browse!</strong></p>
 

<p><strong>A bookstore is a platform, and we make decisions every day about the books we do or do not carry. This is no different. We don’t want to provide a platform for that kind of racist, hateful BS, but our owner thinks it’s more important to “support free speech” — and maybe make a few bucks off a racist shithead.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Who’s right?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Sheena, Tukwila</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sheena,</p>

<p class="noindent">You and your coworkers are right. Before the internet ruined the economic value of words and chains of bookstores sprawled across our great nation, people like your boss could *maybe* argue that they had room on their shelves to reserve for hateful ideas written by bigots. But now more than ever, the allure of bookstores is their curation of great authors and ideas promoted by passionate staff. </p>

<p>Moreover, your boss&rsquo;s fallacious &ldquo;free speech&rdquo; argument is offensive to people with working brains. I could staple my Groupon for &ldquo;single gal&rsquo;s anus bleaching and chin hair removal&rdquo; to a turd and call it feminist poetry but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re obliged to stock it on your shelves. You know this, I know this, your boss knows this – even if he&rsquo;d rather act against the best interests of his customers and business like a milk-fed buttboy of the alt-right movement.</p>

<p>But being right won&rsquo;t get those books off your shelves. So here&rsquo;s what I suggest you do: write up a few bookmarks explaining what a racist shithead Milo Yiannopoulos is, recommend that no one ever support his hateful ideas by reading or buying his books, and then stick them in his books.</p>

<p>If the owner ever discovers them, tell him this: &ldquo;A woman with pocketfuls of spiders came in the other day hawking feminist poetry turds – actual turds with poetry stapled to them – that she wanted us to stock. When I refused, she cursed us for stifling her free speech and then spent a long time flipping through Milo&rsquo;s books. I think her name was Cienna Madrid.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
