<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday August 31: *I Will Send Rain* **</h5></p> 
Rae Meadows’ fourth novel, *I Will Send Rain*, is set against the backdrop of the mid-1930s dustbowl. It’s the kind of impressive, intensely researched work that reinvigorates an author’s career. Meadows shares the stage tonight with Seattle author Martha Brockenbrough, author of *The Game of Love and Death*.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday September 6: *Everfair*
**</h5></p>

Shawl is one of the best sci-fi writers in town, and she deserves to be celebrated
