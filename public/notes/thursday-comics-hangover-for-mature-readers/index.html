<p>Aside from Charles Schulz&rsquo;s <em>Peanuts</em>, American comics aren&rsquo;t great at melancholy. I&rsquo;ve read plenty of depressing comics, and many upbeat comics, but the gentle downward slope of melancholy seems too subtle for most American cartoonists to capture.</p>

<p>The 20th issue of Chip Zdarsky and Matt Fraction&rsquo;s series <em>Sex Criminals</em> is about a breakup. Neither party seems to want to break up, but they both understand that they have to do it. They have sex, even though they know they shouldn&rsquo;t. They have trouble articulating the things they know they need to say. They are uncomfortable in the moment, and they both know it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in another scene, a middle-aged man and woman have sex. She&rsquo;s a retired sex worker. He&rsquo;s an academic. His reaction to her past is getting in the way. She&rsquo;s seen this before. She&rsquo;s tired of it, but she explains it to him anyway.</p>

<p><em>Sex Criminals</em> has always been a special comic. It&rsquo;s based on a one-note gimmick of a plot — a man and a woman find that they can stop time with their orgasms, so they go on a fuck-fueled bank-robbery spree — but it has somehow expanded to incorporate a rainbow of sexual interests, personalities, and questions about what it means to be human. It&rsquo;s explored adult romantic relationships with a subtlety that most modern literary novels can&rsquo;t touch. The depiction of depression in an early issue felt truer and more honest than most memoir. For those reasons and more, the series continues to be a miracle of the American comics industry.</p>

<p>But issue number 20 is something else again. It has the feel of a deep-autumn Charlie Brown strip (albeit one with explicit illustrations of adult genitalia) and it perfectly captures the responsibility and difficulty of adult life. New readers will be entirely lost — hell, I can&rsquo;t keep track of who all these characters are, and I&rsquo;ve been following the book since the beginning — but those who  have read the whole thing will find a remarkable maturation in the book&rsquo;s already-mature themes. If <em>Sex Criminals</em> keeps up like this — and if it, uh, climaxes in a, uh, satisfying way — it could be one of the all-time great serialized comics.</p>
