<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_The Internet Review of 2016_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/margaritanoriega/the-internet-review-of-2016?ref=category_recommended). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Margarita Noriega](https://twitter.com/margarita).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
A collaborative book of short essays and cartoons about this year.

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>
    

<p class="noindent">
Just a great collection of writers and artists, from Newsweek Executive Editor [Margarita Noriega](https://twitter.com/margarita). The contributers are really fantastic, with names you'll know, and names you've yet to discover. Like, art from <a href="http://400facts.tumblr.com" >Stephen Maurice Graham</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/apelad" title="AÍĚ¨Í Íâ.ĚĚKoĚśfĚľĚˇÍord (@apelad) | Twitter">Adam Koford</a>, and writing by Sasha Frere-Jones, Anil Dash, Maris Kreizman, <a href="https://twitter.com/darth" title="darthâ˘ (@darth) | Twitter">@darth</a>, and so many more (<a href="mailto:https://medium.com/@internetreview_/a-running-list-of-our-kickstarter-contributors-and-their-topics-aaf81616ec8a#.ha46oebkz">full contributor and topic list is here</a>). 
</p>

<p>It just looks like a smart, fun way to look back and capture the horror of this past year. Aside: look, I&rsquo;m one of those types who, as great celebrities kept dying and things kept getting all screwy, was saying that &ldquo;a year is just a year.&rdquo; But, even though I&rsquo;ve taken a while to come around, let me tell you, 2016 is just as bad as everybody kept saying. No two ways about it.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
Process your own feelings about 2016 with some great writing. Step offline for a bit, and hold a piece in your hands, maybe sitting on a cold bench in a wind-swept park, where the remains of hope used to frolic. Bring a hot drink, read, and look off into the sunset as if a camera had you perfectly framed, and the flickering shutter can't quite see if that pregnant tear about to roll from your eye is because of giving in to the overwhelming truth of a garbage fire, or just that the wicked cold making your eyes glisten. 
</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Totally solid. They're sold, and more. You just want to get in so you can have your own copy. 
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
