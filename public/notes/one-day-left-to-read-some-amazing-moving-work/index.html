<p>Our thanks to this week&rsquo;s sponsor Esther Altshul Helfgott. If you haven&rsquo;t had the chance to look through the excerpt from her book <em>Dear Alzheimer&rsquo;s</em>, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">you should do so now</a> &mdash; it will only be up through tomorrow.</p>

<p>Helgott&rsquo;s journal of poetry and prose turned poignant when her husband Abe started feeling the effects of Alzheimer&rsquo;s. Her light touch, observational manner, and careful writing make this a moving journey. One full of life and discovery, despite the seriousness of the topic. I think you&rsquo;ll be glad you took the time to <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">read the excerpt we posted this week</a>.</p>

<p>We do things a bit differently around here. We have one sponsor a week, and they offer some of their work for you to read. You could do the same thing with your work, if you wanted. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">Find out more here</a>.
