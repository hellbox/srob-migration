<li><p>You can add poet Sarah Galvin to the short list of Seattle authors who have gone on a European tour. Starting on Sunday, Galvin will be traveling to bookstores in Amsterdam, Krakow, Paris, Berlin, and Reykjavik in support of her terrific new collection out from Gramma Press, <em>Ugly Time</em>. If you know anyone in or near those cities, let them know by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1284894781580376/">sending them a link to the tour page</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Heidi MacDonald at the Beat <a href="http://www.comicsbeat.com/jim-demonakos-to-leave-reedpop/">broke some pretty big news this morning</a>: Jim Demonakos, the Seattle-area comics retailer who started Emerald City Comicon, has left the organization. Two years ago, <a href="http://comicsalliance.com/emerald-city-comicon-reedpop-acquisitn-interview-demonakos-fensterman/">Demonakos sold ECCC to ReedPop</a>, an international producer of comic book conventions. &ldquo;I’m not leaving for another job, I don’t have an immediate new project,&rdquo; Demonakos wrote in a Facebook post announcing the change. This means that next year&rsquo;s ECCC will be the first time the show is not produced by its founder. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if the convention can maintain its essential Seattle-ness without Demonakos at the lead.</p></li>

<li><p>At <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/4/20/why-urbanists-need-to-talk-about-amazon">Strong Towns, Kea Wilson wrote a piece</a> about why urbanists need to talk about Amazon:</p></li>

<blockquote>Amazon has made it their business model to make you think that way: they market themselves as your friendly, invisible big box store, with all of the benefits and none of the massive, concrete drawbacks of the K-Marts of the world that you’ve (rightly) come to distrust. All you see is the website, algorithmically manipulated to show you everything you want and need—and two days later, a little brown box on your doorstep with a smile printed on the side.</blockquote>

<li><p>Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, is <a href="https://www.wikitribune.com/">launching an interesting new news organization</a>. I don&rsquo;t know if Wikitribune will actually work, but it&rsquo;s always worth your attention when people try new models of journalism.</p></li>

<li><p>The bookstore that trolled Piers Morgan on Twitter is now <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2017/04/24/london_s_big_green_bookshop_is_waging_a_twitter_campaign_to_save_itself.html">in the middle of a crowdfunding campaign</a> to stay open.</p></li>
