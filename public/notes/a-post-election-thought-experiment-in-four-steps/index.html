<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Visit, send an email to, or call your local independent neighborhood bookstore. Talk to the store owner. Ask how they feel about the prospect of a President Trump.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Consider this tweet, from the owner of the world&rsquo;s largest bookstore:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congratulations to <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a>. I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.</p>&mdash; Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/796729498075099136">November 10, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Ask yourself, which reaction best reflects your values? Who deserves your money more? Who will better invest your money in your immediate community, in people who are taking action against President Trump? Recall, these things matter. Clicking buttons on websites matter. Where you spend your money matters.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Act accordingly.</p>
