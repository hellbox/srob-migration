<p>Friends, I&rsquo;m going to make a bold announcement: It is quite possible that the best new series of 2018 from one of the big two &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; comics publishers has already made its debut. The book in question was published last Wednesday — the first new comics day of the year — and I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s a comic book based on the old Hanna Barbera character Snagglepuss. Yes, <em>that</em> Snagglepuss:</p>

<p>Written by Mark Russell and illustrated by Mike Feehan and Mark Morales, <em>Exit Stage Left: The Snagglepuss Chronicles</em> is a new limited series that imagines Snagglepuss as a closeted gay playwright in the red-panic blacklist era.</p>

<p>This is the most literary comic I&rsquo;ve read in ages. How literary? Dorothy Parker is a main character in the first issue. &ldquo;Personally, I always admired the Algonquin Round Table, the finest assemblage of wits in American history,&rdquo; Snagglepuss explains to a reporter outside a play. &ldquo;As a young kit growing up in rural Mississippi, they were my Knights of the Round Table. New York, my Camelot.&rdquo; (The reporter then looks at the reader and announces, &ldquo;a young lion makes good. Only in America!&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Much like <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/08/25/thursday-comics-hangover-the-bedrock-of-our-society/">Russell&rsquo;s amazing <em>Flintstones</em> comic from 2016</a>, what should be a one-note joke instead plays out with intelligence, wit, and a strong moral core. Russell has got to be among the finest satirists in modern American comics — admittedly, it&rsquo;s not a crowded field — and his compassion for the character practically throbs off the page.</p>

<p><em>Stage Left</em> isn&rsquo;t afraid to poke around in the darkest corners of post-WWII America. So what if every fifth character or so is an anthropomorphized dog or cat or mouse? And who cares if those talking mammals don&rsquo;t wear pants? I&rsquo;m not sure if the whys and hows of Snagglepuss&rsquo;s world will ever be explained, or if there&rsquo;s a single unified theory of the satire. (Are the animals in human clothes supposed to represent the naivete of 1950s America? Uh, maybe?) But at this point, I&rsquo;m having so much fun with the premise that I frankly don&rsquo;t care.</p>
