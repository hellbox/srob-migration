<p>Good news! <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/960981-129/do-you-think-a-tech-bro">The <em>Seattle Weekly</em> now has a weekly comics column</a> in whch a local cartoonist illustrates an interview with a local band. In the first installment, the fabulous Robyn Jordan illustrates Janice Headley&rsquo;s interview with the band Childbirth. If you don&rsquo;t know Childbirth, they&rsquo;re a poppy punk band that wears hospital gowns onstage and sing catchy, awesome feminist songs like &ldquo;I Only Fucked You As a Joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is great stuff, and it manages to highlight our amazing comics scene and our amazing music scene, simultaneously. What&rsquo;s not to love?</p>
