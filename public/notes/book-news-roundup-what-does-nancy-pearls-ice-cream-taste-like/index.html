<li><p>Harper Lee&rsquo;s estate has reportedly killed the mass-market edition of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>. This is going to make the book inaccessible for public schools around the country. What&rsquo;s this mean? Alex Shephard at the <em>New Republic</em> writes:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Why does this matter? Mass-market books are significantly cheaper than their trade paperback counterparts. Hachette’s mass-market paperback of *TKAM* retails for $8.99, while the trade paperbacks published by Hachette’s rival HarperCollins go for $14.99 and $16.99.</blockquote>

</ul>

<blockquote>The word, a combination of “poison” and “cabinet,” has a variety of meanings in different contexts. At its most literal, a Giftschrank is a space for storing controlled substances in places like pharmacies. Colloquially, it can refer to spaces reserved for all kinds of hidden and forbidden objects, ideas or stories.</blockquote>
