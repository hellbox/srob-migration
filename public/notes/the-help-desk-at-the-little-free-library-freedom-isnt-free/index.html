<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p>

<p class="noindent">**I’m addicted to Little Free Libraries. Every time I pass one, I have to take a book. Sometimes I take three or four. Okay, sometimes I take them all.**</p>

<p class="noindent">**I always *mean* to return the books, or to add something new. But I never seem to get around to it. I just hoard them. Am I a terrible person? Doesn’t circulation mean some people take out, other people put in? Or is that communism?

<p class="noindent">**Please help. I can’t sleep and my neighbors are starting to catch on.**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Mary,</p>

<p class="noindent">Much like my fondness for using stranger's business cards as toothpicks, yours is a peculiar but harmless addiction. Sure, you might be abusing the unwritten social agreement of Little Free Libraries (LFLs) but people break more serious social contracts all the time – for example, by tipping waiters with car wash coupons, or bringing flavored lube to their gyno exams, or paying women far less than their male colleagues, [as if the human penis alone executes 17 percent of a person's daily tasks](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/03/gender-pay-gap-facts/) — as if it had that kind of stamina.</p>

<p>Personally, I think you&rsquo;re doing a public service by raiding LFLs – they&rsquo;re predominantly used as a precious way for people to dump their junk – but if you&rsquo;re feeling self conscious about it, you have a few options:</p>

<p>• Build a LFL in your front yard so that its contents are technically your property, and you&rsquo;re reminded to contribute a book every time you leave the house.</p>

<p>• If you can&rsquo;t stop hoarding books but you could see yourself contributing other stuff, try replacing books with themed items other LFL patrons might find useful. For instance, take a copy of Anna Sewell&rsquo;s classic <em>Black Beauty</em> and leave tickets to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, or replace a copy of Margaret Atwood&rsquo;s <em>Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</em> with a pair of scissors and old shoelaces so that another patron may tie her own tubes. (These are optimistic examples – in all likelihood you&rsquo;ll be replacing stacks of <em>50 Shades of Grey</em> with anus-relaxing poppers. Still, I consider that a LFL upgrade and your neighbors will, too.)</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
