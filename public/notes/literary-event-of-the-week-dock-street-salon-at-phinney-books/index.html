<p>Phinney Books had hosted the Dock Street Salon for a couple years, and the reading series filled a very important geographical slot in Seattle&rsquo;s literary scene: there just aren&rsquo;t too many readings for adults in the miles between University Book Store and Third Place Books. The Salon, which is named after Seattle publisher Dock Street Books, is an informal reading and Q&amp;A session with local authors cohosted by Seattle author and publisher Heather Jacobs and the ever-charming and enthusiastic publisher of Dock Street, Dane Bahr.</p>

<p>The Salon disappeared for a little bit there, and I&rsquo;d worried it had moseyed off into the hall of quietly retired readings series, but I&rsquo;m happy to report that a new installment - the first of 2018 - arrives this Thursday at Phinney Books.</p>

<p>Thursday night, in a reading curated and coordinated by Jacobs, Dock Street Salon is providing a platform for two local first-tine novelists. The first is Port Townsend bookseller Anna Quinn, whose brand-new book <em>The Night Child</em> is about a high school teacher who is terrified by a ghostly vision of a girl&rsquo;s face. The woman desperately seeks a logical explanation, but she might not be prepared for the answer.</p>

<p>Local journalist Jennifer Haupt will publish her first novel, <em>In the Shadow of 10,000 Hills</em>, on (no foolin&rsquo;) April 1st. It&rsquo;s a family saga that stretches from Georgia to the Rwandan genocide. (Haupt covered the genocide&rsquo;s aftermath as a reporter in 2006.)</p>

<p>This kind of event is exactly what Phinney Books does so well in its Salons: it presents local authors in a low-key venue that encourages intimacy and a supportive atmosphere. This is a great opportunity to witness two novelists at the very beginning of their writing careers - and to welcome back one of the best reading series in Seattle.</p>
