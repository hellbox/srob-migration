<p>Last month, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/10/dont-set-a-watchman/">I wrote about</a> why I&rsquo;m not reading <em>Go Set a  Watchman</em>. (Short version: &ldquo;I’d just rather not have to write a negative review of a Harper Lee book.&rdquo;) If you want to read the book, that&rsquo;s your prerogative, of course. And if you want to slag the book without reading it, that&rsquo;s your right as an American, too. But I can&rsquo;t help but feel <a href="http://electricliterature.com/should-go-set-a-watchman-readers-get-a-refund-one-bookstore-thinks-so/">that this news</a> falls less on the side of a natural response to <em>Go Set a Watchman</em> and more on the side of a publicity stunt:</p>

<blockquote>In a move that other proprietors of independent bookstores might consider unthinkable, Peter Makin, the owner of Brilliant Books in Traverse City, Michigan, is **offering refunds** to customers disappointed with Harper Lee’s *Go Set a Watchman*.</blockquote>

<p>I get it. People are unhappy with the book. They have opinions, loud ones, and they want their opinions to be heard. But a refund is a bit much, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>When you buy a book, or when you check a book out from the library, you&rsquo;re quietly agreeing to a social contract: you&rsquo;re offering your attention to a work of art. You may not like the work of art. That&rsquo;s okay. You may like the work of art so much that you feel compelled to respond to it with a work of art of your own. That&rsquo;s wonderful! But a refund just feels so&hellip;dirty and commercial.</p>

<p>As a reader of fiction, you take a chance every time you pick up a book. That&rsquo;s part of the adventure of reading; when bookstores choose to offer money-back guarantees, it&rsquo;s a refutation of the contract between writers and readers.</p>
