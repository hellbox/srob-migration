      <div class="content">
        <p>When the doctor holds my upper arm in his two hands,<br>
he bows his head and listens as if he were waiting to hear<br>
the song of a rare endemic bird no one has seen for centuries.<br>
I start to speak, but he shakes his head, does not loosen his grip<br>
on my arm, turns his fingers around the curve<br>
of my skin and listens again.<br>
I am afraid to clear my throat. My toes stay still.<br>
He must hear my heart where it beats<br>
but he is listening to the sound of bones<br>
the way NASA turns its telescopes far over our heads on Mauna Kea<br>
and hears the universe move.</p>

<p>Rain falls so hard on the roof, I think it might break through.<br>
Imagine all those luminous drops that had been the backbone<br>
of a cloud shattered and lying above the orthopedic surgeonâ€™s head and mine. Soon a puddle, then a trickle into the Wailuku River.<br>
This will mend well, he says, shows me two x-rays.<br>
In the waiting room is a large salt water tank. A zebra moray eel<br>
folds in one corner its brown and white stripes.<br>
I think how it must have no bones at all<br>
or bones so light this eel can wind<br>
around its heaven all night when everyone has left<br>
and dream the dream of breaking into the world.</p>
