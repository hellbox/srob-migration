With her ear for powerful, personal stories, new-to-Seattle cartoonist Sarah Glidden is the finest journalist to hit comics since Joe Sacco first put pen to paper. Her latest book, <em>Rolling Blackouts</em>, is a powerful piece of reportage that investigates what the Iraq War was like for ordinary people in the Middle East.  <em>Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, <a href="http://elliottbaybook.com ">http://elliottbaybook.com </a>.

Brilliant cartoonist Charles Burns was born and raised here in Seattle, and his masterpiece, <em>Black Hole</em>, is a book that practically smells like the Pacific Northwest. Burns’s latest book, <em>Last Look</em>, collects his three most recent titles into one volume. It’s a riff on Tintin, teen angst, and the soul-twisting power of rock music.
