<p>Remember the time you watched your uncle<br>
prepare to enter the woods to hunt? The uncle<br>
hunted with a bow and arrow, he greased<br>
his boots for waterproofing, he wore<br>
a brilliant poppy for a hat. You did not go<br>
to see the breath billow from the mouth<br>
of the uncle past the brush of the brown moustache, <br>
or pause when he paused, knee raised, knuckles<br>
loose, ears prickling. You stayed at home <br>
and hoped for the deer and the uncle to miss <br>
each other, to dance in different parts of the woods, <br>
you didn&rsquo;t know how hunting worked. You imagined <br>
saltlicks and deerblinds and crooks of trees <br>
and cracks of branches. It was all out of books.<br>
The books fell down around them, man and animal,<br>
a flush of russet leaves, and landed without sound.<br>
You went on turning pages, and they went on<br>
stepping silently, and the arrow waited, eager<br>
for the string to touch its lip, for the air to dare<br>
to bite. In you and in the deer and in the uncle<br>
the hot blood ran after its own scents, trailed<br>
by its own pursuers, the hearts made their fists<br>
and opened their mouths over and over.<br>
In the uncle&rsquo;s hand, the arrow felt<br>
indifference, as the knives and bullets<br>
and needles and steering columns all feel<br>
indifference. We are dry, now we are wet.<br>
It is warm, but it will soon be cold, the body,<br>
the blood, the idea of you hovering there<br>
as the last of the life leaks away. Where<br>
does the warmth go? We try to track it down,<br>
to find it lurking in the dark trees, coax it<br>
into sunpools, hope it stares at us<br>
with enormous eyes. We want to touch<br>
its little feet, to turn the soft tongue from side<br>
to side. We move through snow and bear up<br>
under wind. We blink the frost from the lashes,<br>
we flex the thumb going numb in the chill. We want<br>
the beating thing that lies beyond the reach<br>
of our barbed touch. We want chance to spin<br>
the dial, we want the arrow to thread<br>
the gnarled trunks and hit the heat in the heart &mdash;</p>

<p>We run to it, bracken snapping, shouts<br>
of wonder in the ringing air. We hold the heat<br>
a moment, its muzzle wet, and then we feel it<br>
moving off, a shuffling shadow with no edges<br>
cast by a cloud that is not there. And you look up<br>
and the uncle looks up too and the deer<br>
with its amber iris stares along with you<br>
and everyone sees sky and endless space<br>
and the unstoppable cold comes dropping.</p>
