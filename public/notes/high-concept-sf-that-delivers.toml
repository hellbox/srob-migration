<p class="noindent">Sponsor Steve Toutonghi's debut novel _Join_ has just come out in paperback. It's the rarest of SF novels: a gripping concept delivered with compelling page-turning intensity. In the world of the novel, many people can join minds to become a single person. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">We've got the first full chapter on our sponsor's page</a>, so you can see how Toutonghi deftly weaves this high-concept idea into a great story.</p> 

The story follows Chance, a person made of many other people, all living seamlessly as a single entity. But one of Chance's nodes is sick, and in learning how to deal with this, Chance has to confront some uncomfortable realities.
