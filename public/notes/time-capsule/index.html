<p>They felt the wind on the down of their necks.<br>
After the murders, children <br>
in the town dreamed of houses</p>

<p>melting into the sky.<br>
Fear built its hive inside them.</p>

<p>But as they grew<br>
their memories dwindled</p>

<p>like their bicycles that became too small to ride.<br>
The graves<br>
lay buried beneath the trees’</p>

<p>shadows. Parents split<br>
and moved away. One sister<br>
survived. One witnessed the dark ceiling<br>
of every midnight</p>

<p>fall into her thoughts.<br>
Reminders kept surfacing: a red bike<br>
hooked to a chain link fence,</p>

<p>a note folded in a pocket<br>
and put through the wash<br>
until she couldn’t read it, until</p>

<p>it was grit between her fingers. But<br>
she knew &mdash; <em>You will only be a ghost</em></p>

<p><em>sliding through the trees</em>.<br>
This crumbling. Once upon a time <br>
she sank her foot into the shoulder<br>
of a shovel.</p>
