<p class="intro">Every Wednesday between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we're asking some of our favorite Seattle authors to recommend the books they're most excited to give as gifts this holiday. Our fourth author is childrens' book author and cartoonist Jessixa Bagley.</p>

<blockquote>I'm happy to recommend my new favorite book, [*Louis Undercover*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781554988594) by Fanny Britt, illustrated by Isabelle Arsenault. I felt like this graphic novel punched me in the heart. This followup to [*Jane, the Fox, and Me*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781554983605) is a story about a young boy navigating the intense darkness of his parents' recent separation while at he same time experiencing his first love. Both the heartbreaking writing and breathtaking artwork will emotionally level you. Remember to breathe.</blockquote>
