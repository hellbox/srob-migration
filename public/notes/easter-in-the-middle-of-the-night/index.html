<p><em>Catherine&rsquo;s Pascha</em>, written by this week&rsquo;s sponsor Charlotte Riggle and illustrated by R.J. Hughes, is about a girl&rsquo;s determination to stay awake for Pascha. In the Orthodox Christian church, Easter services are held in the middle of the night. It&rsquo;s a story of a girl&rsquo;s coming of age in the culture of her family, and learning about tradition and faith.</p>

<p>Charlotte will be appearing March 11th at A Good Book Cafe in Sumner for a Kid&rsquo;s Night in the Bookstore, for snacks, a reading, and a lights out tour of the store with flashlights. Only twenty slots are availble.
