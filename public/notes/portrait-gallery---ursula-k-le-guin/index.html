<p>A resident of Portland since 1959, <a href="http://www.ursulakleguin.com/UKL_info.html">Ursula K. Le Guin</a> is an incredibly influential writer, particularly in science fiction and fantasy. She received multiple Hugo and Nebula awards, among many other distinguished honors — despite experiencing numerous rejections at the beginning of her career. Le Guin gained widespread popularity in the 60s and 70s with her short stories and <em>Left Hand of Darkness</em>, a novel pioneering the feminist science fiction genre. Her influence extends to renowned authors such as Salman Rushdie, Neil Gaiman, and even George RR Martin, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/NvYCd6pbQ0wCvvY1PFZdtX/7-bestselling-authors-influenced-by-ursula-le-guin">who lists her as a highly respected fantasist</a> that impacted his own novels. Le Guin&rsquo;s daring themes — especially that of gender and androgyny in <em>Left Hand of Darkness</em> — admirably transformed her readers&rsquo; perspectives.</p>
