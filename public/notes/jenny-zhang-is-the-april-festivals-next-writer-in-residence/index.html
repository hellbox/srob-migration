<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://twitter.com/APRILfestSEA/status/664165747254362112">the APRIL Festival announced</a> that Jenny Zhang will be the writer-in-residence of their next festival, which will take place the week of March 15—20, 2016. Zhang is the author, most recently, of the poetry collection <a href="http://www.octopusbooks.net/books/dear-jenny-we-are-all-find"><em>Dear Jenny, We Are All Find</em></a>. Unfamiliar with her work? Try <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/250614">this piece, which she published with <em>Poetry</em> magazine</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When someone dies, we go searching for poetry. When a new chapter of life starts or ends — graduations, weddings, inaugurations, funerals — we insist on poetry. The occasion for poetry is always a grand one, leaving us little people with our little lives bereft of elegies and love poems.</p>

<p>But I want elegies while I’m still alive, I want rhapsodies though I’ve never seen Mount Olympus. I want ballads, I want ugly, grating sounds, I want repetition, I want white space, I want juxtaposition and metaphor and meditation and ALL CAPS and erasure and blank verse and sonnets and even center-aligned italicized poems that rhyme, and most of all — feelings.</p></blockquote>

<p>She has <a href="http://www.rookiemag.com/2015/04/far-away-from-me/">also written</a> extensively for the wonderful <a href="http://www.rookiemag.com/2012/10/literally-the-best-thing-ever-m-i-a/"><em>Rookie</em> magazine</a>. You&rsquo;ll have plenty of opportunities to get acquainted with Zhang&rsquo;s work this spring; the writer-in-residence at APRIL participates in a number of readings and also writes about the festival as it happens. It&rsquo;s a great way to get a writer acquainted with Seattle, and vice versa.</p>
