Sponsor Northwest Associated Arts is bringing David Sedaris to the Broadway Performance Hall for eight performances over seven days. It&rsquo;s the second (&ldquo;second annual&rdquo;? dare we hope?) time Sedaris has put on this event: a week-long series of readings to workshop his newest project. This year, the book is <em>Calypso</em>, a collection of essays that won&rsquo;t come out until summer. Seattle: you know how far away summer is. Don&rsquo;t miss this chance for a preview.</p>

<p>There’s more information <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/">on our sponsor’s page</a>, or you can buy tickets <a href="http://sedaris.strangertickets.com">here</a>. Act now; two of the dates are already sold out, and last year they went faster than hotcakes.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Northwest Associated Arts for sponsoring the site this week. If you&rsquo;re interested in doing the same — and putting your book or event in front of our readers, while supporting some of the best writing about books in the city — check out <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">available dates in 2018</a>. Like Sedaris, we sell out quickly, so make sure you&rsquo;re on the calendar now.</p>
