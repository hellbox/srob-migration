<p>Today is the 14th anniversary of the <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> attacks. This morning, a Facebook user shared <a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/n/main.asp?webtag=ellis&amp;nav=messages&amp;msg=23018.1&amp;prettyurl=%2Fellis%2Fmessages%2F%3Fmsg%3D23018%2E1&amp;gid=2040474526">this Warren Ellis fan forum thread</a> from the day of the attacks. Reading through it, I realized I&rsquo;d forgotten so many details from that day: the confusion, the fear, the hope, the hatred, the ugliness.</p>

<p>In this one thread on a comic writer&rsquo;s forum, you can watch America turn itself upside down and rip itself apart. You can see the trajectory of the next 10 years, laid out in the frantic writings of a handful of scared people.</p>
