<p>Congratulations are due to Seattle author Sherman Alexie, who won a <a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/carnegieadult">Carnegie Medal</a> for his amazing memoir, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/stitch-by-stitch-by-broken-stitch/"><em>You Don&rsquo;t Have to Say You Love Me</em></a>. <em>Love Me</em> is the non-fiction winner, and Jennifer Egan&rsquo;s acclaimed <em>Manhattan Beach</em> won the fiction prize this year. If you haven&rsquo;t read either of these books, you should fix that right away.</p>
