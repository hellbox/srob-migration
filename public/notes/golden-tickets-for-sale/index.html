<p>Individual tickets for Seattle Arts and Lectures&rsquo; 2015 and 2016 reading series are now available on their website. This is the best SAL season in years, featuring authors like Ta-Nehisi Coates, Emily St. John Mandel, Teju Cole, and Claudia Rankine. If you can&rsquo;t afford a full series pass, now is the time to <a href="http://www.lectures.org/season/">stock up on tickets</a> for the lectures you simply can&rsquo;t miss. The Coates and Cole readings, in particular, will likely sell out soon.</p>
