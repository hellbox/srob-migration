[Christine Marie Larsen](http://www.christinelarsen.com/) is off for the next few weeks, no doubt hand-assembling brushes from rarified animal hairs, gathering pigment from the mineraled rocks atop the highest peaks, and making paper from the miraculous cotton rags used to clean the paintings of the old masters in the Louvre. 

In her absence, you can always see her work in our [archive of the Portrait Gallery](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/portrait-gallery/). She'll see you all in a few weeks.
