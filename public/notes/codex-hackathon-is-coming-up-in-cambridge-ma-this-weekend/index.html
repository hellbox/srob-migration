<p>Heading east for the <a href="http://2016.alamidwinter.org">American Library Association Midwinter meeting</a> in Boston? Are you interested in the future of books and reading? Check out the <a href="http://codexhackathon.com">CODEX hackathon</a> over at the MIT Media Lab January 8-10.</p>

<p>The concept of a hackathon may seem daunting if you&rsquo;re not a developer or designer, but really, don&rsquo;t be intimidated. Typically, small groups of people are put together to work a problem, or respond to a conceptual prompt. As they say <a href="http://codexhackathon.com">on the site</a>, &ldquo;Programmers, designers, writers, librians, publishers, readers. All are welcome.&rdquo; If you have the interest, and ideas of what people are doing right and wrong, you will fit right in.
