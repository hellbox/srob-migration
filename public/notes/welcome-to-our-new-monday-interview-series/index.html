<p>We&rsquo;ve made a few changes with our weekly columns in 2017. You seem like <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/01/03/introducing-our-new-poet-in-residence-program/">our new Poet in Residence program</a> on Tuesdays. I love the <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/01/07/seattle-writing-prompt-the-pyramid-atop-the-skyscraper/">Saturday Seattle Writing Prompts</a> that Martin has on tap.</p>

<p>And we&rsquo;re changing things up for Monday, too. For the last year and a half, we ran a Bookstore of the Month feature, in which we talked to booksellers, discussed bookstore histories, and talked about Seattle&rsquo;s strong bookstore culture. Now, every Monday we&rsquo;ll run a new interview. Sometimes they&rsquo;ll be long interviews with authors. Other times we&rsquo;ll check in with Seattle folks to see what they&rsquo;re reading. Once a month, we&rsquo;ll chat with our Poet in Residence. And this week, we looked inside the Seattle Public Library&rsquo;s Seattle Reads program.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re giving up on Seattle bookstores. In fact, quite the opposite: we hope to regularly feature booksellers in our interview series. But this opens up the day to more of Seattle&rsquo;s voices, the people who make the literary city work. If you have any ideas for people you&rsquo;d like to see featured on the site on Mondays, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/">please let us know</a>.</p>
