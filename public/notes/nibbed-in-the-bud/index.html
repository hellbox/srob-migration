<p>Cartoonist Matt Bors just announced that his online cartooning hub The Nib has parted ways with blogging site Medium. Of the split with Medium, Bors simply says &ldquo;our ambitions diverged,&rdquo; and he promises that &ldquo;I donâ€™t think it will be long until I have something to announce&rdquo; in terms of The Nib finding a new home. Let&rsquo;s hope not; The Nib has been publishing some great comics on a regular basis and in its short year and a half of existence, it became a destination for those in search of good comics on the web. This is something the internet desperately needs.</p>
