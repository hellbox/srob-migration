<p>glugs of amber winelight lay like legs<br>
splayed/splashed/slayed on the glasswood floor</p>

<p>what one might think of as a heavy<br>
smoke-colored cover of clouds is no, is<br>
actually smoke</p>

<p>honey candies on the fresh white pillow case:<br>
the pillow itself the pillow of a woman long dead<br>
smelling of that womanâ€™s bed i</p>

<p>lay my deathhead down</p>
