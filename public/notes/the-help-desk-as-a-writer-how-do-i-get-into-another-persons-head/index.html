<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p>
 

<p class="noindent">**I've done NaNoWriMo a few times and I have this one problem: My characters always turn out to be me, and it's boring the shit out of me. Last year, I tried to make the main character do some fun stuff: get into bar fights, go on a trip to the Middle East — I even tried to make him an undercover spy. But in the end, he snapped back to the same boring guy working at the same boring office. Why can't I engage my imagination? Am I cursed to always write what I know? Should I give up fiction forever?**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Jeff,</p>

<p class="noindent">You are in luck, as this is the perfect week to begin practicing escapism, much like my spiders do every time I try to contain their orgies to shoe boxes. Reading and writing are excellent ways to help people forget, however briefly, the practical (or carnivalesque) horrors of their daily lives.</p>

<p>You want to know how to write about someone other than yourself. I have two exercises for you:</p>

<p>1) Swap the gender of your main character – make her a woman, or LGBTQ, basically any type of person on the sexual or gender rainbow other than yourself. Instead of making your novel plot-driven, make it character driven. Explore how the world you&rsquo;ve created perceives your character, how they navigate that world, how they interact with other characters you&rsquo;ve created. (Tom Wolfe did this with the 2004 novel <em>I Am Charlotte Simmons</em>, which I personally thought was dull but other people went crazy for. I am confident you can do better than Tom Wolfe.)</p>

<p>2) Think of someone you personally know whom you actively dislike. Make them your main character, and, like the previous exercise, make your novel character driven as opposed to plot driven.</p>

<p>Both of these writing prompts are exercises in empathy. The best writing helps readers relate on some level to characters they don&rsquo;t understand or are even repulsed by. If you want your writing to resonate with an audience – or if you simply want to stop boring yourself – challenge yourself by writing about people and situations that make you uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
