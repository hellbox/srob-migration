<p>Henri had ‘no other teacher<br>
but nature.’ I recalled that factoid<br>
from an art history class while peaking</p>

<p>thick with narcotics in the clinic bed<br>
then they scotch-taped me to the ceiling<br>
in his poster-sized jungle print.</p>

<p>The safe place for banished PYTs<br>
ripe with uglifruit, there I learned<br>
a woman leaves <em>The Virgin Forest</em></p>

<p>much the same way she came in.<br>
I laid across the forest’s plush green<br>
canvas. My own foliage, shorn</p>

<p>the night before. Smooth palm leaves<br>
split open in jungle book narrative<br>
where the shadow doctor conflicted</p>

<p>beneath uterine sun &mdash;<br>
part man part beast.<br>
Then the thunder.</p>

<p>And it was broken asunder.<br>
And then it was over.<br>
Blood orange fruition</p>

<p>of the smallest, wild hope<br>
crawled out of me for five days<br>
in broken shells and poked yolk.</p>
