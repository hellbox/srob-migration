<li><p>Tickets for the May 23rd Seattle appearance of <em>Arrested Development</em> and <em>Transparent</em> actor Jeffrey Tambor <a href="http://www.lectures.org/season/special_events.php?id=470">went on sale yesterday</a>.

</ul>

<blockquote>As an author, being my own e-book retailer gets me a lot. It gets me money: once I take the normal 30 percent retail share off the top, and the customary 25 percent royalty from my publisher on the back-end, my royalty is effectively doubled. It gives me a simple, fair way to cut all the other parts of the value-chain in on my success: because this is a regular retail sale, my publishers get their regular share, likewise my agents. And, it gets me up-to-the-second data about who's buying my books and where.</blockquote>

<li>Regarding that tweet, to aspiring writers: for God&rsquo;s sake, <strong>don&rsquo;t suffer for your art</strong>. Just write every day, no matter how difficult it may be. You will improve and it will get easier. Writing doesn&rsquo;t have to be a Kafkaesque experience.</li>
