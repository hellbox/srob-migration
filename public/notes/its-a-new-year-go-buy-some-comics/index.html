<p>We&rsquo;re taking the day off to enjoy our loved ones, and we hope you&rsquo;ll do the same. Tomorrow we begin a new year in earnest, with several fun new features and more on the way. But today, if you&rsquo;re looking for something to do, stop by Comics Dungeon in Wallingford for their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/348658922175339/">annual year-end (and year-beginning) sale</a>. Take it from me: there is no joy as pure as digging through a box of $1 comics and finding $20 worth of cultural artifacts to plow through on a cold winter afternoon.</p>
