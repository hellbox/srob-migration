<p>Sherman Alexie just posted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShermanAlexieAuthor/posts/794117287465276">an open letter to his Facebook page</a> announcing the cancellation of most of the upcoming speaking engagements for his new memoir, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/stitch-by-stitch-by-broken-stitch/"><em>You Don&rsquo;t Have to Say You Love Me</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Love</em> is a memoir about a tumultuous year in Alexie&rsquo;s life — one in which his mother passed away and Alexie underwent brain surgery to remove a benign tumor. The book was published on a fairly fast schedule, which means Alexie was still deep in the process of grieving and recovering from the events described in the book. The book tour for <em>Love</em>, Alexie writes, was a &ldquo;retraumatizing&rdquo; experience.</p>

<p>You should <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShermanAlexieAuthor/posts/794117287465276">read the whole letter</a>, which is a poetic and confessional document that feels like an addendum to the memoir. But here&rsquo;s the part of the announcement with the information that&rsquo;s relevant to most of his readers:</p>

<blockquote><p>Because of the short notice, I'll still perform at my gigs in San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco this month. But I am cancelling all of my events in August and I will be cancelling many, but not all, of my events for the rest of the year. Dear readers and booksellers and friends and family, I am sorry to disappoint you. I am sorry that I will not be traveling to your cities to tell you my stories in person.</p>

<p>But I will be writing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Alexie continues with a promise to his readers: &ldquo;when I am strong enough, I will return to the road. I will return to the memoir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Writing and reading from a memoir can be cathartic for an author, but it is also an act of emotional labor. For a reader and a performer like Alexie, who throws his whole self into every performance, it must have been a grueling experience to relive the worst and most despairing parts of his awful year over and over again in front of audiences.</p>

<p>Above and beyond all else that he does — a novelist, a filmmaker, a screenwriter, a children&rsquo;s book author — Alexie is a poet. This means that the need to tear out his heart and show it to a room full of strangers is part of his DNA. We&rsquo;re sure he can&rsquo;t wait to get back to it, but we&rsquo;re so grateful that he&rsquo;s taking the time to make sure that he&rsquo;s healthy. We wish Alexie the best and we can&rsquo;t wait to see him when he goes out on the road again.</p>
