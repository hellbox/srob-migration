<p>Italian news sources <a href="http://www.corriere.it/cultura/16_febbraio_20/morto-umberto-eco-6a6c8fac-d760-11e5-a4d1-c8704a1e2204.shtml">are reporting</a> that author Umberto Eco has passed away. He turned 84 years old last month. Eco is the author of two global bestsellers: <em>Foucault&rsquo;s Pendulum</em>, a playful conspiracy thriller; and <em>The Name of the Rose</em>, a murder mystery set in a Benedictine monastery. I especially enjoyed Eco&rsquo;s underrated 2004 novel <em>The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana</em>, a deeply personal tribute to the comics and pulp literature of Eco&rsquo;s youth, as well as a rumination on memory and aging. Eco&rsquo;s novels were always fun and elegant and rewarding on multiple levels; he created beautiful labyrinths.</p>
