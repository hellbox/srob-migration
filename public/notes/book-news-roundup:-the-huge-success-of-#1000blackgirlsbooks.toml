* We [told you a couple weeks ago](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/27/book-news-roundup-the-diversity-in-publishing-edition/) about Marley Dias, the student who, "sick of reading about white boys and dogs," launched the #1000BlackGirlsBooks hashtag. Now, [according to Vox](http://www.vox.com/2016/2/12/10978772/marley-dias-1000blackgirlbooks-diversity), Dias's mission is complete: She has collected 1000 books featuring black girls as main characters, and is donating them to libraries in her school and to an elementary school in Jamaica. Here is Dias on *The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore*, discussing her project:

* Here is a sentence that is full of awesome: Shoreline Community college students, inspired by a social-justice-themed science fiction anthology, are hosting a book drive benefitting Books to Prisoners. [Read more here](http://news.shoreline.edu/2016/02/11/books-to-prisoners-student-government-book-drive/).

* The Douglass-Truth branch of Seattle Public Library is [hosting a display](https://shelftalkblog.wordpress.com/2016/02/12/50796/) featuring the history of the Seattle Black Panther Party. If [Beyoncé's incredible Super Bowl show](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/08/beyonce-black-panthers-homage-black-lives-matter-super-bowl-50) piqued your interest in the Black Panthers, this is a good way to learn more.

* I like Medium as a website; I think it's a great way to adapt blogging into something a little more thoughtful. But it does seem to be full of Tech Folks with Opinions. Like, for instance, [Vinod Khosla](https://medium.com/@vkhosla/is-majoring-in-liberal-arts-a-mistake-for-students-fd9d20c8532e#.dempr3usb):

<blockquote>If luck favors the prepared mind, as Louis Pasteur is credited with saying, we’re in danger of becoming a very unlucky nation. Little of the material taught in Liberal Arts programs today is relevant to the future... Though Jane Austen and Shakespeare might be important, they are far less important than many other things that are more relevant to make an intelligent, continuously learning citizen, and a more adaptable human being in our increasingly more complex, diverse and dynamic world.</blockquote>

* Look, I could go on about this, but I just want to leave a little thought here in response: science is very important! Obviously. But **why do we have to promote science at the expense of literature**? Shouldn't a good education produce well-rounded students? Shouldn't we be concerned about the humanity of students, as well as their marketability? Good, lord, why would we transform education into an all-or-nothing proposition?
