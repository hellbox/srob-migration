Leaning in is so three years ago: Jessica Bennett says it’s time for working women to punch back. Her new book is a “guide to navigating subtle sexism at work, providing real-life career advice and humorous reinforcement for a new generation of professional women.” Let’s go crush the patriarchy.  <br />
