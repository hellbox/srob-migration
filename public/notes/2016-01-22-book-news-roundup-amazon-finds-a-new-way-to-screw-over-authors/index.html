<li><p>The <em>Seattle Weekly</em>&rsquo;s Mark Baumgarten <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/962709-129/on-the-eve-of-his-latest">talks with David Brewster</a> about his Seattle atheneum, Folio. I <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/24/opening-the-folio/">wrote about Folio last fall</a>, and it&rsquo;s now open to the public. If you&rsquo;re wondering whether a paid library/coworking space is right for you, you should drop by and take a look. It&rsquo;s on Marion Street, between 3rd Ave and 4th Ave downtown.</p></li>

<li><p>VIDA updated their <a href="http://www.vidaweb.org/list-of-women-run-presses/">excellent list of presses run by women</a> this week. Women still don&rsquo;t possess an equal share of high-profile positions in the pubishing industry; supporting these presses is a way to help correct that imbalance.</p></li>

<li><p>The people behind popular narrative horror/comedy podcast <em>Welcome to Night Vale</em> are branching out by launching a podcasting platform, <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/night-vale-creators-to-start-new-podcast-platform/?emc=edit_tnt_20160121&amp;nlid=65389624&amp;tntemail0=y&amp;_r=0">reports the <em>New York Times</em></a>. They hope to experiment with longform serialized fiction podcasts, which sounds like a great idea.</p></li>

<li><p>Newspapers are dying. <a href="https://medium.com/@dicktofel/the-sky-is-falling-on-print-newspapers-faster-than-you-think-c84a2f9a9df4#.4ug850m54">No, really</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Graphic novel sales in bookstores <a href="http://www.comicsbeat.com/graphic-novel-sales-up-22-in-bookstores-in-2015/">increased by 22 percent</a> last year.</p></li>

<li><p>We&rsquo;ve been hearing from a lot of self-published authors who are upset with Amazon lately. Author <a href="http://ammadden.com/dear-amazon/">A.M. Madden has published an open letter</a> to Amazon on her blog that lists the majority of these complaints: basically, Amazon keeps changing the rules on their self-published authors. These changes result in huge financial losses for the writers, who are locked into Amazon&rsquo;s ecosystem and are, therefore basically powerless. &ldquo;My fans have increased, and I now have nine books published instead of just three, yet in 2015, I made <strong>less than half in royalties that I made in 2014</strong>,&rdquo; Madden writes. Go <a href="http://ammadden.com/dear-amazon/">read the whole letter</a>.</p></li>
