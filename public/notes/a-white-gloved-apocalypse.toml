<p class="noindent">Sponsor Anne Mendel delivered us a full chapter from her comically twisted dark novel _Etiquette for an Apocalypse_. Set in Portland in 2020, Mendel gives us a future when humanity is falling apart, people are fending for themselves, but the protagonist's mother still insists on dressing for dinner. What standards should we hold as society collapses around us?</p>

[Read the first full chapter on our sponsor's page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) &mdash; we think you'll really enjoy it. Visit Portland in the near future, and learn all about survival in a high-rise condo during the apocalypse. 

Sponsors like Anne Mendel make the _Seattle Review of Books_ possible. Did you know you could sponsor us, as well? We only have four slots left in our current set, which ends in July.
