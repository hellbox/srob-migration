<p>As I said yesterday, I am loving the newfound attention Colson Whitehead is receiving. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with Whitehead&rsquo;s work, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/books/colson-whitehead-on-slavery-success-and-writing-the-novel-that-really-scared-him.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">this interview with Jennifer Schuessler of the <em>New York Times</em></a> is a great way to learn about him.</p>

<blockquote><p>He mentioned a bookstore owner from the South who invited him to come down for “a frank talk about race.”</p>

<p>“I’m honored by the response to the novel, but I was like, ‘Can we just talk about the book?’” he said. “I’m not a representative of blackness, and I’m not a healer.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Hugo House is bringing Whitehead to the <a href="https://hugohouse.org/event/colson-whitehead/">Seattle Public Library on Saturday, September 17th at 7 pm</a>. Start getting excited now.</p>
