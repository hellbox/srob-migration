<p>I have <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/08/24/thursday-comics-hangover-dumbforgiven/">written before</a> about how much I detest Mark Millar&rsquo;s <em>Old Man Logan</em> story. It&rsquo;s the worst of modern superhero comics: cynical, try-hard, a crass rip-off of a significant pop cultural icon (Millar should have to pay royalty checks to Clint Eastwood for what he did to <em>Unforgiven</em>.) Somehow the series, which imagined Wolverine living in a dystopian future in which the Hulk breeds with his cousin to father a posse of inbred hulkbillies, managed to inspire Hugh Jackman&rsquo;s final Wolverine movie, <em>Logan</em> - a film with all the heart and thoughtfulness that the original series lacked. But that&rsquo;s the only good thing to ever come out of <em>Old Man Logan</em></p>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1522908229867/oldwomanlaura.jpg)</p>

<p>Until now. The 33rd issue of <em>All-New Wolverine</em>, which follows the adventures of Wolverine&rsquo;s younger female clone Laura, kicks off a new storyline called <em>Old Woman Laura</em>. Written by Tom Taylor and illustrated by Ramon Rosanas, this series seems to be a direct response to <em>Old Man Logan</em> - a critique and a call to better superheroic storytelling.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t read a single issue of <em>All-New Wolverine</em> before this one, but I could still easily follow the action. Laura - a character that almost everyone knows, thanks to Dafne Keen&rsquo;s heartfelt portrayal in <em>Logan</em> - is a national leader in a utopian future. She&rsquo;s mentoring an even-younger clone of herself, Gabby, who has taken on the Wolverine name for herself. (This is not the ugly, grim Wolverine of the 1990s: Gabby makes her grand entrance in the comic by groaning at the bad guys, &ldquo;Urgh, you&rsquo;re the worst.&rdquo;) Laura learns that her time on Earth might be numbered, so she decides to fix the two biggest mistakes from her past: give one person a second chance, and kill another person who escaped justice.</p>

<p>Where <em>Old Man Logan</em> was nasty and mean, <em>Old Woman Laura</em> is fun and compassionate. &ldquo;We fought against greed and hate and fear. And we actually made the world a better place. The heroes won,&rdquo; Laura announces in the first few pages. It&rsquo;s accompanied by a cityscape drawn by Rosanas that shows glimmering towers and huge expanses of vegetation, all in lush shades of green. It&rsquo;s a beautiful world - one that laughs in the face of <em>Old Man Logan</em>&rsquo;s loathsome dustbowl.</p>

<p>Of course, things could go wrong between this first issue and the end of the <em>Old Woman Laura</em> storyline, but Laura&rsquo;s quote above seems to be the mission statement for the book, a refutation of the cynical worldview espoused by Millar in <em>Old Man Logan</em>. Millar argued that even if heroes did their best, they&rsquo;d still lose because the natural order of things is to decay and turn sour. Taylor and Rosanas seem to take Millar&rsquo;s vision into account, talk amongst themselves, and then reply, &ldquo;yeah, fuck that.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m with them.</p>
