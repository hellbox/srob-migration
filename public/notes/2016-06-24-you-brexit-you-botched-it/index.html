        <p>Well, er, good morning. Seattle writers are responding to the news that the world&rsquo;s gone all Trumpy. You should read <a href="https://nicolagriffith.com/2016/06/24/uk-rip/">Nicola Griffith on Brexit</a>:</p>

<blockquote>This vote broke the UK; it might break the EU. There will be a recession, a bad one. The xenophobes have been unleashed. This result has invited the whirlwind.</blockquote>

<p>We&rsquo;re starting to see <a href="http://publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/international/international-book-news/article/70751-what-brexit-means-for-book-publishing.html">posts about what Brexit means for the publishing industry</a>, but the truth is that nobody knows what&rsquo;s going to happen — not really. If you console yourself on difficult news days by watching very smart people try to think their way through events, Adam Rakunas has been <a href="https://twitter.com/rakdaddy/status/746375199839256576?lang=en">very active on Twitter</a> about all this, and G. Willow Wilson is <a href="https://twitter.com/GWillowWilson?lang=en">always a worthy Twitter follow</a>.</p>

<p>Some mornings you wake up and the world goes all screwy. The fact is, though, there are some things that are always true: You should vote. (You should <em>always</em> vote.) You should keep an open mind, and think before you speak. You should find the smartest, most compassionate people you know, and you should really listen to what they&rsquo;re saying. You should point out untruths when you see them and speak up for people who don&rsquo;t have a voice. And, of course, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1889-hello-babies-welcome-to-earth-it-s-hot-in-the-summer">you&rsquo;ve got to be kind</a>.</p>
