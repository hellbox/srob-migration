<p>The newest issue of Marvel&rsquo;s <em>The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl</em> is billed as a &ldquo;special &lsquo;zine&rsquo; issue,&rdquo; which immediately grabbed my attention. I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of alternative sensibilities applied to superhero comics — the <a href="http://www.againwiththecomics.com/2010/02/coober-skeber-lends-hand.html"><em>Coober Skeber</em> &ldquo;Marvel Benefit Issue&rdquo;</a> is one of my all-time favorites, and <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/graphic-novels/bizarro-comics-0">DC&rsquo;s <em>Bizarro Comics</em> trade paperback</a> is a lot of fun, too — and while I haven&rsquo;t read that many Squirrel Girl comics, the character is an appealing meta-take on the superhero genre, and I&rsquo;d been wanting to read more.</p>

<p>The premise of this issue, laid out in a series of framing pages at the beginning and end of the comic, is that a library was destroyed in a superhero battle, and Squirrel Girl has assembled a benefit zine to raise funds to rebuild it. The comics are supposedly by Marvel heroes and villains, though it&rsquo;s really an anthology of one-and-two-page comics by a variety of cartoonists.</p>

<p>The concept is fine, but the execution is a little disappointing. There&rsquo;s nothing really zine-y about the comic. The creators are, for the most part, mainstream. Hell, <em>Garfield</em> creator Jim Davis is listed as a contributor, and you can&rsquo;t get any more mainstream than <em>Garfield</em>. (Davis&rsquo;s contribution is a series of strips replacing Garfield with Galactus and replacing Garfield&rsquo;s owner Jon with the Silver Surfer. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the joke.)</p>

<p>A few of the strips in the issue are very good, particularly a self-help book narrated by a brain in a jar and a short little tone poem from the perspective of Thor&rsquo;s trickster brother Loki. And one strip drawn by Anders Nilson, involving Wolverine and a giant robot, gets the alternative spirit of the enterprise just right.</p>

<p>But I wonder what this issue of Squirrel Girl would have looked like if instead of summoning a fairly well-known ensemble of talent, the editors had gotten the contributors to the newest issue of Seattle free comics newspaper <em>Thick as Thieves</em>, instead?</p>

<p>Marie Hausauer&rsquo;s contribution to <em>Thieves</em>, a bar scene featuring a few trashy patrons hitting on each other, is creepy and true-to-life and beautifully rendered. On the next page, Travis Rommereim contributes a little gag strip about a man who abuses a talking severed head on a chain that taunts him with bad jokes and dares. (&ldquo;Are you gonna shoot some arrows at me or what?&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Most of the strips in this issue of <em>Thieves</em> seem fairly well grounded in realism. There&rsquo;s a conversation between two young women, and a kid who plays with guns. Gil Rhodes tips things over into absurdity with a fantastic strip about a grandmother who repeatedly gives the worst advice ever, but even that strip doesn&rsquo;t beat you over the head with its surrealism. It&rsquo;s relatively quiet, and it&rsquo;s comfortable with the quiet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet that none of the contributors to this issue of <em>Thick as Thieves</em> are dying to work on a mainstream superhero comic. But that&rsquo;s part of the reason why they should have been asked to contribute. Marie Hausauer&rsquo;s Squirrel Girl really would have been an alternative comic to behold.</p>
