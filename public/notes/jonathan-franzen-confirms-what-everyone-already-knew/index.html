<p><em>Slate</em>&rsquo;s Isaac Chotiner asks Jonathan Franzen if he&rsquo;s ever considered writing a book about race:</p>

<blockquote>I have thought about it, but—this is an embarrassing confession—I don’t have very many black friends. I have never been in love with a black woman. I feel like if I had, I might dare.</blockquote>

<p>Is there a word for when self-parody becomes the self? Is Jonathan Franzen the Donald Trump of the literary world?</p>
