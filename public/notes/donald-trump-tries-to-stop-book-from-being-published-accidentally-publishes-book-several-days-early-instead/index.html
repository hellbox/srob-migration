<p>This morning, Donald Trump&rsquo;s White House filed a cease-and-desist order against Henry Holt, the publishers of <em>Fire and Fury</em>, an upcoming book by Michael Wolff about the interior workings of the Trump administration. The book, which was scheduled to be published on Tuesday, has already <a href="http://time.com/5087774/michael-wolff-book-cease-desist-letter-steve-bannon/">made headlines</a> after several <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/01/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-book-donald-trump.html">gossipy excerpts</a> were leaked online.</p>

<p>Greg Evans <a href="http://deadline.com/2018/01/fire-and-fury-publication-date-henry-holt-michael-wolff-donald-trump-1202235790/">at Deadline</a> reports that Henry Holt responded to Trump&rsquo;s cease-and-desist in exactly the right way:</p>

<blockquote>“Due to unprecedented demand,” Holt said in a statement, “we are **moving the on-sale date for all formats of ‘Fire and Fury,’ by Michael Wolff, to Friday, January 5, at 9 a.m. ET**, from the current on-sale date of Tuesday, January 9.”</blockquote>

<p>Fantastic! One thing: If you&rsquo;re interested in buying Wolff&rsquo;s book tomorrow, please make sure that you buy it from an independent bookstore. This book very likely has very little caloric content, politically speaking — the policies of the Trump administration are what matter, and what we should be obsessing over — so you should at least support the families of local booksellers with your purchase, rather than lining the pockets of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/24/16697520/jeff-bezos-net-worth-100-billion-dollars-amazon">some other impossibly wealthy man</a>.</p>
