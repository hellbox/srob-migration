<p>The Arkansas-born poet who published with Copper Canyon Press <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2016/01/c-d-wright-1949-2016/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+HarrietTheBlog+(Harriet%3A+The+Blog) yesterday. She was a MacArthur &quot;Genius&quot; award winner and a giant on the American poetry scene. You can find some remembrances of her life and work by [Max Brantley](http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2016/01/13/cd-wright-arkansas-native-poet-dies-at-67">died unexpectedly</a> and <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/blogs/slog/2016/01/13/23417447/in-praise-of-poet-cd-wright">Rich Smith</a>, and there will undoubtedly be more in the days and weeks ahead.</p>

<p>For right now, I&rsquo;d like to send your attention to a recording of Wright reading her own poem &ldquo;<a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/177350">Everything Good Between Men and Women</a>&rdquo; at the Poetry Foundation. It&rsquo;s a loud, lively, even raucous poem that starts with a bang (the title flows dircectly into the opening lines, &ldquo;has been written in mud and butter/and barbecue sauce&rdquo;) and concludes with a demand for the reader to &ldquo;Call it a night. O soul. Flow on. Instead.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a powerful demand from a poet to her audience, and tonight it feels like something more: sad, encouraging, raw. It feels like an invocation, a demand, and a love letter all at once.</p>
