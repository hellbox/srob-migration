<p>A free Brooklyn-based comics newspaper called <em>Smoke Signal</em> — the same magazine <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/07/05/barging-right-on-in/">that partially inspired Seattle&rsquo;s late, lamented <em>Intruder</em> comics paper</a> — is publishing <a href="http://www.resistsubmission.com/about.html">a special anti-Trump comics paper called <em>Resist!</em></a> Published in time for Inauguration Day and with a print run of over 30,000 copies, <em>Resist!</em> ought to make a splash as one of the first artistic protests of President Trump. <em>Resist!</em> is edited by <em>Raw</em> co-founder Françoise Mouly and Nadja Spiegelman, and it seeks to publish (mostly women-produced) comics &ldquo;on the theme of political resistance to the forces of intolerance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the strips to be published in <em>Resist!</em> are already <a href="http://www.resistsubmission.com/images">up on the paper&rsquo;s site</a>. <a href="http://www.resistsubmission.com/images/tuesday-3pm2435527">Margaret de Heer&rsquo;s cartoon</a> of two women in bed discussing the future of freedom in Donald Trump&rsquo;s America is a gorgeous cartoon that charms with its specificity — one of the women is nude while the other is in a t-shirt and underwear, which feels like a dash of realism — even as it makes a hopeful point. On the darker end of the spectrum, <a href="http://www.resistsubmission.com/images/wednesday-12-pm5191845">My Ngoc To&rsquo;s strip</a> demonstrates the difficulty of getting out of bed in the days since the election. <a href="http://www.resistsubmission.com/images/friday-12pm4688116">Shreya Chopra</a>&rsquo;s surreal strip depicts a world awash in menstrual blood. (Menstrual blood is a recurring theme, which makes sense, given our incoming president&rsquo;s commentary about Megyn Kelly bleeding &ldquo;out of her wherever.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>One of the high points of the <em>Resist!</em> comics featured on the site so far is Seattle cartoonist <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/authors/tatiana-gill/">Tatiana Gill</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.resistsubmission.com/images/thursday-9am5812102">The Stages of President Trump</a>.&rdquo; The black and white comic consists of tiny panels illustrating the 15 steps Gill experienced after Trump&rsquo;s election, including &ldquo;Grief&rdquo; and &ldquo;Anger&rdquo; and &ldquo;Frenzy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Excessive Dog Cuddling.&rdquo; The tightly drawn panels evoke the kind of emotional constriction that many of us in Seattle have felt since November, a kind of claustrophobia of the mind that keeps our thoughts cycling through tiny circles of despair. It&rsquo;s a terrific example of emotional representation through the form of comics, and it echoes the larger themes of addiction and recovery that power Gill&rsquo;s strongest work.</p>

<p>Copies of <em>Resist!</em> will be given out at the women&rsquo;s march on Washington DC on Inauguration Day, while other copies will be shipped to comics shops around the country. But if you&rsquo;d like to support the publication and distribution of <em>Resist!</em>, you can <a href="http://www.resistsubmission.com/store/p2/buy">order a copy for $10</a> — shipping included — on the <em>Resist!</em> site.</p>

<p>Comics aren&rsquo;t going to erase the Trump presidency from American history. But by publishing smart, funny comics by a diverse group of women, <em>Resist!</em> is laying out a blueprint for the future of artistic resistance for the four years to come. This is accessible protest art, a clear message that travels far and wide on sheets of cheap newsprint.</p>
