We celebrated our distance from New York,<br>
high-fived each other as our words

debuted in _Open Books_ and _Floating Bridge_,

_Elliott Bay_, and the daze of _The Typing Explosion_.<br>
That’s what they will call us you predicted

as we stood on the edge of Summit Avenue

near Broadway, _The Seattle School_, while the newfangled<br>
streetlight wandered in and out of power.

We were younger then, with little idea

of poetry schools, just a sense of the work we revered:<br>
my Bishop to your Rilke and Celan.

No herons on our pages, no water views.

Our lives as the poets barely minted,<br>
we attempted daily practice, failed

at monastic prayer, and acquired several cats.

We were nobodies inhabiting blue basements<br>
until step by step our bright lives

extended upwards and soon our books

caught between us, some breadcrumbs of awards.<br>
Tonight I want to return to that streetlight—

the long night’s amble into iambs<br>
and hold tight to our glitter of ambitions—

irregular as the blinking bulb.
