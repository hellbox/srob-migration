<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p>

<p><strong>My boyfriend and I are moving in together next week. I&rsquo;m very excited about this, and I&rsquo;m confident it&rsquo;s the right move. But we just had our first fight over a moving issue, and it&rsquo;s something I feel very strongly about: he wants to merge our book collections together. I want to keep our shelves separate. It&rsquo;s not that I fear intimacy; I&rsquo;m 95 percent sure we&rsquo;re going to get married one day, and I&rsquo;m very happy with him. But I&rsquo;m not sure I ever want our books to mingle. Is a lifetime of bookshelf non-monogamy too much to demand?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Judy,</p>

<p>I have never lived with a man — not because I refuse to blend my bookshelf, for far more broken reasons — so feel free to take my advice with the same side-eyed respect you’d give a porn star in sweatpants. As I see it, how you arrange your book collection is a sacred thing. For instance, my books are arranged on three shelves: The top is all-time favorites no one is allowed to touch; the second is books I have never read, arranged in the order I aspire to read them; the third is books I have stolen from other people, mostly for petty reasons.</p>

<p>If a MAN came into my space, swinging his DICK around and inserting copies of <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> and <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> and <em>Hemp: A History</em> all willy nilly — trigger warning — my shelves and I would feel a little violated.</p>

<p>Explain this to your boyfriend. If he still does not understand the importance of separate bookshelves, I suggest you get a cat. Name it Cienna. Then, whenever you and your boyfriend have a domestic dispute, wait until he sleeps. Take one of his books off the shelf. Piss on it. Blame it on Cienna. This will provide you with a physical way to vent your spleen after a fight (full disclosure: I don’t know physics) while slowly weeding your bookshelf of his books.</p>

<p class="noindent">You’re welcome,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
