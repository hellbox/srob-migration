        <p><strong>UPDATE 3:39 PM</strong>: We <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/03/22/tonights-lit-fix-reading-has-been-canceled/">received word</a> that at the last minute, this edition of Lit Fix has been canceled. Apologies to all.</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL POST 9:59 AM</strong>: When Mia Lipman moved to Seattle from San Francisco in 2011, she was delighted to find that our city had an “active, supportive literary scene.” But no matter how hard she looked, she couldn’t find her favorite kind of reading: the dive bar cabaret, combining readings with stand-up comedy and musical performances. Back in San Francisco, she says, “it was par for the course to invite bands or comics to perform between authors.” Her search for divey variety shows came up empty. “So I decided to start one myself,” Lipman says.</p>

<p>The boneyard of expired Seattle readings series is vast. In that graveyard, the long-running shows with devoted followings (from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sky_Poetry_Theatre">Red Sky Poetry Theatre</a> to Breadline to the recently departed — and perhaps not entirely deceased — Cheap Wine and Poetry series) are hugely outnumbered by an anonymous collection of  long-forgotten attempts to get something started. A successful reading series is a community unto itself: people feel safe there, eager to return, and enthusiastic about relaxing and letting their guard down in public.</p>

<p>This week at Chop Suey, on Wednesday at 7 pm, the series that Lipman started, Lit Fix, celebrates its fourth anniversary — a milestone that something like 95 percent of most fledgling reading series never manage to reach. Readers include Brian McGuigan, Robert Lashley, novelist Laurie Frankel, Quenton Baker, and Kathleen Alcalá, and the $5 door charge benefits <a href="https://www.rewa.org">ReWA</a>, a nonprofit that benefits the families of immigrant and refugee women with culturally sensitive assistance.</p>

<p>Lipman says Lit Fix’s goal as a series has always been simple. She looks for writers of all kinds — “established and new authors, poets and essayists and novelists, women and people of color and queer and traditional voices” — and asks them to share their work. “There’s never a topical theme, but I think the best nights have been when everyone onstage and in the audience winds up on the same page,” she says. A particular high point was a reading in winter of 2013, when writers Harold Taw, Corinne Manning, Indu Sundaresan, and Jason Kirk delivered “stories about transition and discovery, dirty haiku, [and] ugly Christmas sweaters” to a standing-room only crowd.</p>

<p>What would Lipman tell someone asking her for advice on starting a series of their own? First, she says, attend “as many readings as possible first to get a sense of what’s already out there and what kind of niche you can fill.” And then, once you know what you’re trying to do, “never be afraid to ask your dream author to read for your series! Writers (and musicians) are amazingly generous with their time and energy, and they’re often looking for new ways to connect with each other.”</p>

<p>To people who’s never attended Lit Fix, Lipman acknowledges that it’s “easy to retreat in winter, and that solitude has value. But being part of a community means you need to leave the house now and then to meet people where they are.” Once you exercise the effort to leave the house, “nothing feels better than cozying up with like-minded people in a relaxed space to hear someone brave open up their head and show you what’s inside.” Stop being a recluse and go see why Lit Fix has survived for four astounding years. “I promise it’ll keep you warm,” Lipman says.</p>
