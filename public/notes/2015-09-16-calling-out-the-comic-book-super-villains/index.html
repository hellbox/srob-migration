        <p>Alex de Campi&rsquo;s critically acclaimed Wonder Woman comic, <em>Sensation Comics</em>, is being canceled. DC Comics has moved the separate ongoing <em>Wonder Woman</em> comic, which is terrible, under the Superman editorial banner. <a href="http://alexdecampi.tumblr.com/post/129003838049/you-can-only-find-the-best-version-of-wonder-woman">On her blog</a>, de Campi makes pubic some gossip that&rsquo;s been writhing just under the surface of the comics industry for decades now:</p>

<blockquote>Now, the Superman office allegedly employs no women, and a cursory glance over the mastheads of several Superman titles and Wonder Woman seems to confirm that allegation. The reason, I’ve been told by several people who work or used to work at DC, is because one of the most senior editors is a sexual harasser with multiple incidents on his HR file. I don’t use “alleged” here because at least one incident (grabbing a woman’s breasts) happened publicly at a corporate social gathering with multiple witnesses. There was also something about sticking his tongue down an artist’s girlfriend’s throat when the artist was in the bathroom. Again, public gathering.</blockquote>

<p>This is not a case of one bad apple:</p>

<blockquote>I’m also talking about it because man, I am *sick to death* of corporate comics telling me they caaare about me and my lady-dollar as a reader, and then continuing to employ / protect known harassers. Kids, there are five known big-name, vindictive harassers in comics, and about three bad drunks. Two harassers are writers employed by DC; one is a DC editor; two are writers employed by Marvel.</blockquote>

<p>This is a culture of silence and an old boys&rsquo; club and it needs to end. In the meantime, it&rsquo;s surely not going to get easier in the short-term for di Campi as she faces the wrath of the angry white male geek internet. Go seek out some of di Campi&rsquo;s books and give them a try; if you like them, buy them. Amplify her message and <a href="https://twitter.com/alexdecampi">show her your support</a> as best you can.</p>
