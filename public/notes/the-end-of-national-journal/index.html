<p>For a while there in 2009, reporting on books and publishing basically involved firing up the old internet-box on a daily basis and looking around to see which magazines were going out of business. Thankfully that crisis has passed, but we still lose good magazines every now and again. <em>National Journal</em>&rsquo;s print publication is going under at the end of this year; the publisher says &ldquo;News in DC now moves too quickly for a weekly publication.&rdquo; Layoffs may follow. The publication will still live online, though the transition to online-only is not always an easy one. <em>National Journal</em> always presented a smarter, less tabloid-y version of <em>Politico</em>&rsquo;s DC insider-rag schtick. It was not always the best magazine on politics, but you could at least always tell the staff cared about their topics, and about the importance of good writing.</p>
