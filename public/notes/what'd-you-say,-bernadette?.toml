If you ever wanted to learn what the process of recording an audio book is like, [Judy Oldfield Wilson's interview with Kathleen Wilhoite](http://blog.libro.fm/book-of-the-month/narrator-kathleen-wilhoite-on-the-best-and-worst-parts-of-making-an-audiobook/) about the recording of the audio version of *Where'd You Go, Bernadette* is fascinating stuff. *Bernadette* was Wilhoite's first book recording experience — she was enlisted by *Bernadette* author Maria Semple for the job — and by all accounts, she nailed it.
