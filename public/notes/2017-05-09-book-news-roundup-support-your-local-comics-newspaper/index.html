        <ul>
<li><p><em>Thick as Thieves</em>, the <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/02/16/thursday-comics-hangover-thick-as-thieves-hits-the-streets/">excellent young Seattle-based comics newspaper</a>, is <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thickasthieves">running a Patreon</a> to fund future issues. If you put in $5 a month, you&rsquo;ll get five copies of every new issue of the paper. (Admittedly, <em>Thick as Thieves</em> is a free paper, but I don&rsquo;t have to explain to you that art is worth money, do I?)</p></li>

<li><p>Yes, Bill Clinton and <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/10711191/James-Patterson-how-the-bestseller-factory-works.html">literary sweatshop owner James Patterson</a> are <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2017/05/bill-clinton-and-james-patterson-are-writing-a-novel.html">&ldquo;collaborating&rdquo; on a novel about a missing president</a>. No, you shouldn&rsquo;t read it. Anything that Patterson touches turns into a soulless brick of commercial fiction.</p></li>

<li><p>In the Fantagraphics Free Comic Book Day comic, <a href="http://www.cbr.com/pepe-frog-creator-kills-white-supremacist-icon/">Pepe the Frog creator Matt Furie killed Pepe once and for all</a>. Furie had tried to do battle with the Trump-loving white supremacists who ran off with his creation, but it&rsquo;s almost impossible to reclaim a symbol like that, once it&rsquo;s been turned into a sign of hate.</p></li>

<li><p>In a masterful show of trollery, Amazon is opening its 13th brick-and-mortar Amazon Books location in <a href="https://the-digital-reader.com/2017/05/06/amazon-open-bookstore-old-bn-location-washington-dc/">a Washington DC space that previously was home to a Barnes &amp; Noble</a> store.</p></li>

<li><p>In a shitty show of trollery, Amazon is changing its deal with booksellers and authors. In response, an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/third-party-sellers-can-now-win-the-buy-box-on-amazon_us_590b309be4b05279d4edc31f?section=us_books">author named Brooke Warner published an essay</a> titled &ldquo;How Amazon, Once Again, Is Driving Down The Value Of Books And Undermining Authors.&rdquo; That headline is pretty much evergreen.</p></li>

<li><p>Some good advice for booksellers and librarians everywhere:</p></li>
