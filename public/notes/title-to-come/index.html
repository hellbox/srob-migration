<p>This <a href="https://www.jonkers.co.uk/blog/working-titles-of-famous-novels">Jonkers infographic</a>, &ldquo;Working Titles of Famous Novels,&rdquo; is an interesting study of what might have been. Would <em>1984</em> have been as popular as it has been if it retained its working title of <em>The Last Man in Europe</em>? I kind of doubt it. That said, some of the working titles are better: I&rsquo;ve always preferred <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>&rsquo;s working title because it better reflects Ayn Rand&rsquo;s on-the-nose aesthetics. A quick internet search reveals that people have been <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/21/classic-books-original-titles-_n_3311784.html">wondering after working title what-might-have-beens</a> for years. (<em>Wacking Off</em> might be a better, more appropriate title for the Philip Roth novel than <em>Portnoy&rsquo;s Complaint</em>.)</p>
