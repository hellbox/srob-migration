          You never stop reciting certain lines from certain poems. Whether battered into your head through schoolroom platforms, or the kind of reading every poetry lover experiences: reading, and then that heart-stopping feeling of your mind bending to the poet&rsquo;s will. The special effects in the movie Inception are familiar to the poetry lover, we feel that world spin every now and again.
And that spin turns into mantra, the quoted line a straight shot to a pattern of synaptic syntactic firing, a shorthand for the feeling: comfort, curiosity, wonder, regret.

          The Face is a new series of book-length essays centered around an interesting theme: in each volume, an author writes about their own face. It’s an idea that at once seems expansive as the horizon and as claustrophobic as a broom closet. When meeting strangers, we look to their face for hints of inner character, but we also chastise people for being too narcissistic if they seem overly obsessed with their own appearance.

          Since August of 2014, co-founders Connor Guy and Alex Davis-Lawrence have published Moss, a self-described “Online Journal of the Northwest,” for free at mosslit.com. It’s a literary magazine that publishes quality longform fiction and non-fiction from, and interviews with, Northwest writers. Last week, Davis-Lawrence and Guy, announced that they were bringing on Spokane novelist Sharma Shields — author of the excellent The Sasquatch Hunter&rsquo;s Almanac — as a contributing editor, with a few more editors yet to be added.

          It’s a hateful job, delivering news of death: the fact of its very existence, its unexpected arrival, its sudden probability. It’s heavy enough just to describe how it feels for the whole idea to swirl in, like a loaded paintbrush tainting the water in a jar. In her latest memoir, What Comes Next and How to Like It, released in paperback today, Abigail Thomas reluctantly and humanely shoulders the job, “just poking at death with a long stick to see what happens.

          I stop at Mercer Street Books to pick up the review copy of Lunatics, Lovers and Poets. Where to read it? Which restaurant? Where? Too many cars, too loud, I don’t want to cross the street. Irish pub? No, it’s too dark, too much dark wood, in the middle of our block I avoid the selva oscura. Floyd’s! Floyd’s? It’s gone! How about Mecca, that’ll work, but that’s all the way round.

          Canadian cartoonist Chester Brown reads from his new book *Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus: Prostitution and Religious Obedience in the Bible* on [Saturday, April 16th at 7 pm at the Hugo House](https://hugohouse.org/event/book-party-for-chester-browns-mary-wept-over-the-feet-of-jesus/). Both of the *Seattle Review of Books* co-founders, Paul Constant and Martin McClellan, read the book, and it left them with a lot of conflicted feelings. The following is a conversation they had on a Google Doc as they tried to determine what it was about *Mary* that left them feeling so strangely dissatisfied.

          Humans have enjoyed marijuana for about 12,000 years. It is now recreationally legal in four states and medically legal in roughly half of the country. In America, 18.9 million have sparked a joint in the past 30 days.
I first sampled the wonders of weed while attending San Rafael High School, the northern California institution of learning that introduced the term “420” to the popular vernacular in the early 1970s. Over the ensuing decades, I have enjoyed a steady relationship with the kind herb.

          Singapore is especially difficult for Westerners to understand. People who visit come back like a blind man from the parable of the elephant, convinced that the trunk they felt represents the whole of the place.
Infamously, William Gibson wondered where the underground was when he visited in 1993 and wrote his Wired essay &ldquo;Disneyland with the Death Penalty&rdquo;. He lamented, among other things, the loss of the red light district.

          Every good story gets the timing right. In the case of the brand-new Encyclopedia Greenwoodia &mdash; a collection of prose, poetry, and images by, for, and about Seattle’s Greenwood neighborhood &mdash; timing is the story.
For more than a decade, the Greater Seattle Bureau of Fearless Ideas (BFI; formerly 826 Seattle), a Greenwood-based youth writing and tutoring center, has produced annual volumes written by students, occasionally together with adult mentors and author friends of the nonprofit.

          “Consider: A stranger calls you on the phone, says she’s conducting a survey, and asks if you believe in God,” Lesley Hazleton writes near the beginning of her new book. “You can answer only yes or no, since don’t knows don’t count. And consider too that if you simply hang up, as you’re likely to do if you consider this an absurdly simplistic question, you don’t count either.” Hazleton is explaining why polls usually indicate that Americans are such devout believers in God; if you force someone to make a binary choice, all nuance and shading simply disappears.
