        <div class="content">
          I’m not a Whovian. I’ve seen and enjoyed a few episodes of the Doctor Who season where the Doctor was played by Christopher Eccleston, but I don’t have the patience to immerse myself in the dense continuity and playful self-indulgence of Doctor Who fandom. The hours I contribute to television-watching are relatively few, and I tend to be a completist about these sorts of things. I don’t have enough hours in my life to contribute to the cause of watching all the Doctor Who episodes out there floating around the streaming sites.

Zombies, zombies everywhere. Who the hell isn’t a little sick of zombies at this point? Even people who love carnage and a little fictional gunplay ought to be getting sick of zombies by now, right? You can stretch the metaphor like a wad of chewing gum — the zombies stand for consumerism, or they represent our germ-phobia, or they represent our self-loathing — but eventually that thin pink strand is gonna break.

        <div class="content">
          If you’re a human being with a working heart, you will cry when you read The Best Party of Our Lives1. Likely multiple times. Sarah Galvin’s2 collection of interviews with same-sex couples about their weddings is a goddamned happy-tear factory. Whether you prefer to read stories of old couples or young couples; whirlwind romances or thoughtful, long relationships; couples with opposite interests or couples who are practically clones of each other; you’ll find a pairing here that speaks to you.

        <div class="content">
          Words in Air, the correspondence between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell, is one of the books I’m never entirely not reading. I pick it up all the time, and it’s always better than I remembered. There is a unique effect of these writers, their letters soothe my mind, the way the exact right word can be both calming and exciting no matter the topic. Their letters make being a person seem like a reasonable way to spend time.

          The jokes write themselves. Shortly after the publication of Future Visions: Science Fiction Stories Inspired By Microsoft, a friend posted a graphic about it. In the image, Clippy, the infamous animated paperclip/Microsoft Office assistant, is saying, &ldquo;Hi! It looks like you&rsquo;re trying to dock over Alpha Centauri! May I suggest reverse thrusters?&rdquo;
There&rsquo;s just no way to resist poking fun at any company publishing a book &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; by itself. Imagine &ldquo;Caffeinated Comedy: Knock-Knock Jokes About Starbucks&rsquo; Pumpkin Spice Latte,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tape-Filled Tomes: Adventure Stories In Which 3M&rsquo;s Post-It Notes Save the Day.

          I&rsquo;ve always wondered how art collectors decide which artists to collect &mdash; not the profit driven monsters who play galleries like traders play the markets, but true fans who love art and emerging artists, who show up early and often, and buy many pieces by new talent. But it dawned me while I read Molly Crabapple&rsquo;s memoir Drawing Blood: they learn the artist&rsquo;s story. When you learn someone&rsquo;s story, you forge an empathetic lock with them.

        <div class="content">
          Michel Houellebecq is a terrible person. He is also, if his translators have done their job correctly, an excellent writer. This isn’t a rarity — plenty of writers are awful people. But unlike many of the worst people who write, Houellebecq doesn’t try to conceal his awfulness. Instead, he revels in it.
Houellebecq has made a career out of provocation. His essay praising H.P. Lovecraft’s ahuman tendencies is probably the best critical reappraisal of Lovecraft ever written.

          See You in the Morning, Mairead Case’s debut novel, is a love story if a love story means trying to become someone who doesn’t always feel shut off. It’s the summer before senior year in high school, and the unnamed narrator is already planning to move away from a town that’s maybe too comfortable or not comfortable enough, not dreamy but not dreary — maybe there aren’t enough options, but what options is this narrator looking for?

        <div class="content">
          The introduction to Destiny and Power, the new biography of George H.W. Bush, makes it pretty clear where Jon Meacham’s loyalty as a biographer lies. Bush, Meacham writes, “was driven less by ideas about politics than by an ideal of service and an ambition — a consuming one — to win.” He continues:
Americans unhappy with the reflexively polarized politics of the first decades of the twenty-first century will find the presidency of George H.

        <div class="content">
          As the co-founder of this site put it in September, we are living in a golden age of publishing. Social media, the Espresso Book Machine and yes, even Amazon’s e-book arm have collapsed the distance between writer and audience, and in some cases entirely circumvented the need for traditional publishers.
In the face of these near-instantaneous platforms, those traditional publishers start to look like hidebound anachronisms, stubbornly inefficient relics from a bygone, pre-digital age.
