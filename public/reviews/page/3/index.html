          Bellingham poet Robert Lashley is probably best known for his stage presence. Lashley comes from the spoken word scene, and he is one of the best readers in the region: there’s a moment in every one of his performances when he shifts from mild-mannered stage patter to the poet with that voice, and it’s always a bracing moment.
You can always tell when someone in the audience has never attended a Lashley reading before because they rear up when that voice makes itself known.

          We think of books not as commodities but as symbols of individuality. But centuries before the Industrial Revolution, printing presses were mass-producing books. In fact, books are the first item that we mass-produced as a species, and we’ve gotten really good at making sure that every copy of a specific book is exactly the same as every other copy.
Part of the reason Jeff Bezos chose books as the commodity on which to establish his online retailing venture was the fact that books, as products, are so uniform.

          Bruja is the Spanish word for witch, and it’s possible that the witch in Wendy C. Ortiz’s latest book is Wendy herself. Not only does Ortiz watch a cheetah chasing a possum through a window, she manages to catch a bear whispering into the ear of another bear, and she is present while a sea turtle turns into a seal. She survives several shark attacks, jumps into a car that flies over rooftops, has an affair with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and attempts to murder her mother.

          When you watch a movie, you’re handing over a remarkable amount of control over to the artists who made the film: the movie starts, the narrative unspools at its own pace, and then it’s over. You can’t really get through a movie’s story any quicker than its director intended without fast-forwarding or skipping or taking some other drastic action that breaks the art.
Conversely, when you read a book the author has virtually no control over the time that the story takes in your mind.

          She hurt a man’s ego and there was a war and terrible carnage.
This is Sayantani Dasgupta&rsquo;s nutshell recap of the Hindu story of Draupadi, a girl made of fire, in her book of essays Fire Girl: Essays of India, America, and the In-Between. Draupadi, considered a feminist icon, didn&rsquo;t hesitate to speak her mind, so the miffed male unleashed the forces at his disposal and pretty much wrecked the world.

          Cartoonists don’t often get a chance at second acts. We expect comics artists to keep drawing the same immortal characters over and over until they grow old and die, like Charles Schulz; or until they retire from the business, like Gary Larson; or until they perfect their art and ascend to the literary heavens, like Lynda Barry.
Tacoma cartoonist Peter Bagge, then, is the great exception. His semi-autobiographical Buddy Bradley comics — partially canonized last year in the deluxe two-volume reprint collection The Complete Neat Stuff — is largely considered one of the cornerstones of 1990s alternative comics.

          You see you wouldn’t ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals. On the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity. We would all love its will to reach for the sun. Well, we are the roses. This is the concrete. These are my damaged petals. Don’t ask me why. Ask me how. –Tupac Shakur, “The Rose That Grew From Concrete” in the hood / everyone is driven to kill / by some kind of distinct / famine –Hanif Willis-Abdurraqib, “On Hunger” Hunger and famine — more precisely, the ever-present avoidance of them — are the ordering principles of Hanif Willis-Abdurraqib’s first collection of poetry, *The Crown Ain’t Worth Much*.

          Eventually we’ll get to the stars, but first we have to walk.
 I do not like to run. I’ll sprint for a bus now and again, but the rhythm of jogging, the enthusiastic bouncing, has always felt artificial to me.
Instead, I prefer to walk. Not jaunts to the corner store or after-dinner strolls through the neighborhood. I can walk a marathon every Saturday — in fact, I basically require it.

          It seems that nearly every page of Seattle author Kevin Emerson’s young adult science fiction novel Last Day on Mars has a blinking light on it. Since the book takes place on a Mars colony in the far-flung year of 2213, most of the lights are on console panels or spacefaring equipment. There are some signal lights, too, and a few twinkling stars. But the book is really about one giant blinking light: the sun, billions of years ahead of schedule, is about to go supernova and then collapse, rendering our solar system inhospitable.

          It’s not often that I find an epiphany in a book. Sure, books deepen my understanding and broaden my perspective, but an out-and-out epiphany? A miraculous moment in which the fog clears and my vision focuses on something new? That’s a rare thing. Arlie Russell Hochschild’s Strangers in Their Own Land delivered such a new insight to me, and it’s on a topic I’ve been batting around in my head for months — maybe years.
