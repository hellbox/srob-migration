          Dear Eve &mdash;
The hardest part of being a writer is seeming natural. It's the same with actors: I was once in a commercial — an extra off to the side of one scene. The lead actress was doing improv, and when she turned to me and showed a crinkled nose of disgust and spit out some off-the-cuff line, I almost broke character because I thought she just blew the take and was mad at herself.

          We all owned one. My 1970s-era View-Master was red plastic with white trim, and the reels my parents bought for it tended towards the G-rated and Disneyified &mdash; Cinderella, Bambi, maybe an occasional visitor from the Krofft Super Show. (Why were those other sea monsters so mean to Sigmund?)
But my sister, 18 years older than me and the mother of my three nieces, was a young stay-at-home mom on a limited budget who haunted garage sales like it was her job.

          Anyone looking at a copy of Benjamin Marra’s Terror Assaulter: OMWOT (One Man War on Terror) is forced to do some heavy categorizing. The cover features a guy in a suit, wearing sunglasses, and smoking a cigarette beheading a bad guy with a katana. The bad guy is armed with a gun and a chainsaw, built like the proverbial brick shithouse, and is dressed like an old He-Man figure: blue briefs and a belt, frilly boots, and a little cape.

          Some people would argue that forbidden love stories are the only love stories worth telling. The people who would argue that are probably not the kind of people you should date. Sure, a love story can be compelling if parents or society or circumstances deny the lovers from their right to be happy. But not every transgression is a welcome one, and not every love story is innocent.
The titular narrator of Jennifer Tseng’s novel Mayumi and the Sea of Happiness believes that she is in love, and she believes passionately in the love story she’s telling.

          When you edit a book titled The Best American Comics 2015, you are almost certainly setting yourself up for failure. Surely Jonathan Lethem knew this when he signed on for the job. Worse yet, when he agreed to be the editor of the 2015 edition of The Best American Comics, he must have known he was immediately following Scott McCloud’s entry in the series, which is by far the best Best American Comics to ever see publication.

          Memoirs are sometimes too much for me to handle, but I can read autobiographical comics all day, every day. So what’s the difference? Ultimately, it’s a matter of scale. You have to suspend a whole lot of belief to cozy up to the idea that a human being’s life coheres exactly to something resembling a narrative arc with a beginning, a middle, and an end — especially when it’s got a pat little moral plugged into the core of the thing.

You&rsquo;ve hopefully already read Paul&rsquo;s definitive guide to the Short Run Comix and Arts Festival, but I wanted to share what my more personal experience of what the day was like.
I was with my five year-old, who was pretty excited as soon as he figured out that he could trick &lsquo;r treat at most of the tables, so long as they showed a little pink indicator sign. This was ingenious, so thank you to all of the tables that participated.

Conventions are strange. We find them appealing because they’re momentary — they exist for a day, or a weekend, and then they’re gone. But we also become attached to specific conventions; we get used to the rhythms and organizational themes, and we get upset when we feel that a convention has “betrayed” its original voice. So we expect conventions to be transitory, but we also demand consistency from convention organizers.

          Sarah Vowell is in rare company when it comes to her ability to craft a biting, funny sentence. She’s up against David Sedaris and Jincy Willett and a small handful of other names. Consider this line from her latest book, Lafayette in the Somewhat United States:
“I do not think that there can ever be enough books about anything; and I say that knowing that some of them are going to be about Pilates.

          Johanna Sinisalo, fondly known as the queen of Finnish Weird, is coming to Seattle, and will be appearing at the Elliott Bay Book Company on October 24th, and I&rsquo;m quite excited about it. I live in Seattle. Elliott Bay is my neighborhood bookstore. I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Sinisalo&rsquo;s work for years. And I&rsquo;ve been asked to serve as a sort of host, because I translated her two most recent novels into English.
