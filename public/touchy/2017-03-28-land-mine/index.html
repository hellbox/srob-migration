<p>I like a little violence<br>
in my poetry<br>
because I don’t trust<br>
the sweetness<br>
of too-ripe words, like<br>
I don’t trust a man<br>
who says, “you’re wonderful”<br>
too quickly.<br>
What would he say<br>
if I told him the sugar<br>
on his tongue<br>
is only what I allow him<br>
to taste?</p>

<p>I used to preen<br>
when a lover called me<br>
easygoing, as if<br>
being no trouble at all<br>
was some kind of glory,<br>
as if un-troubling<br>
his waters would keep<br>
the current from pulling<br>
me under, kicking<br>
the wind out,<br>
from filling my lungs<br>
with salt water<br>
and sorrow.</p>

<p>This is how a woman<br>
protects herself,<br>
with yes and sure<br>
and I don’t care,<br>
how she paves every pothole<br>
so others wont need<br>
to remember how much<br>
earth is still root, crack<br>
and resistance,<br>
so others wont feel<br>
the quaking and know<br>
that earth never intended<br>
to be tamed.</p>

<p>But I can’t take all<br>
the blame. You see,<br>
they never looked up.<br>
Not once.<br>
Never saw the sentry<br>
in the tree<br>
three clicks up the road<br>
or the sniper on the rooftop<br>
trained to kill<br>
any me that didn’t heel<br>
quick enough. Now,<br>
when a man calls<br>
me easygoing<br>
I land mine,</p>

<p>explode his body<br>
into pieces I salvage<br>
for my tricked-out ride,<br>
cruise down main street.<br>
Hydraulics at my fingertips.<br>
My fingers itch<br>
when I hear the engine growl,<br>
“I would have loved you<br>
anyway. I would have<br>
loved you more.”</p>
