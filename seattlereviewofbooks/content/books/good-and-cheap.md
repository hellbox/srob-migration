description = "A perfect and irresistible idea: A cookbook filled with delicious, healthful recipes created for everyone on a tight budget and a cookbook with a strong charitable component: With every copy of \"Good and Cheap \"purchased, a second copy will be given to a person or family in need. While studying food policy as a master's candidate at NYU, Leanne Brown asked a simple yet critical question: How well can a person eat on the $4 a day given by SNAP, the U.S. government's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program informally known as food stamps? The answer is surprisingly well: Broiled Tilapia with Lime, Spicy Pulled Pork, Green Chile and Cheddar Quesadillas, Vegetable Jambalaya, Beet and Chickpea Salad even desserts like Coconut Chocolate Cookies and Peach Coffee Cake. In addition to creating nutritious recipes that maximize every ingredient and use economical cooking methods, Ms. Brown gives tips on shopping; on creating pantry basics; on mastering certain staples pizza dough, flour tortillas and saucy extras that make everything taste better, like spice oil and tzatziki; and how to make fundamentally smart, healthful food choices. The idea for\" Good and Cheap\" is already proving itself. The author launched a Kickstarter campaign to self-publish and fund the buy one/give one model. Hundreds of thousands of viewers watched her video and donated $145,000, and national media are paying attention. Even high-profile chefs and food writers have taken note like Mark Bittman, who retweeted the link to the campaign; Francis Lam, who called it Terrific ; and Michael Pollan, who cited it as a cool kickstarter. In the same way that TOMS turned inexpensive, stylish shoes into a larger do-good movement, \"Good and Cheap\" is poised to become a cookbook that every food lover with a conscience will embrace."
