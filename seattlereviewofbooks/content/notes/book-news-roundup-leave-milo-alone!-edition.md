* Jseattle [at Capitol Hill Seattle blog](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/cms#/wh/content/notes) says that the Elliott Bay Book Company building is going up for sale:

<blockquote>“This offering represents a unique opportunity to invest in a 100% leased property with a stable retail income stream and **future development potential** located in one of Seattle’s hottest and growing neighborhoods,” the pitch from the Jones Lang LaSalle real estate firm concludes.</blockquote>

* "An average of five people are kicked out of Seattle Public Libraries (SPL) each day," Nathalie Graham [writes at the South Seattle Emerald](https://southseattleemerald.com/2017/02/16/seattle-public-library-rules-a-bane-to-the-homeless/). Her full report on SPL's anti-homeless policies is a must-read.

* Shockingly, Milo Yiannopolous's agent, who recieves a portion of Yiannopolous's income as a writer, has written an editorial for *Publishers Weekly* titled "[In Defense of Milo Yiannopoulos's Book](http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/columns-and-blogs/soapbox/article/72794-in-defense-of-milo-yiannopoulos-s-book.html)." Thomas Flannery Jr writes:

<blockquote>When protesters try to silence Milo, when they show up to his events and physically threaten him, or scream and smear fake blood all over themselves, or riot and destroy property, they are using tactics I, as a self-described progressive, have always chided others for using. I won’t stand for it when religious groups try to silence transgender supporters, and I won’t stand for it when so-called progressives try to silence conservative voices.</blockquote>

* Regarding the above quote: Flannery is confusing freedom of speech with a right to a platform. Just as Yiannopoulos has a right to speak, protesters have a right to protest him. And if Yiannopoulos threatens students, [as he did in Miluaukee](http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/12/milo-yiannopoulos-harassed-a-trans-student-at-uw-milwaukee.html) colleges have a right to not give him a platform. Remember, while Flannery whines about people raising their voices, it was a Yiannopoulos fan who [shot a protester when Yiannopoulos spoke at the University of Washington](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/cellphone-of-admitted-uw-shooter-was-wiped-clean-court-records-show/). So who's doing the intimidating, here? And why should *Publishers Weekly* have given a platform to someone who is financially vested in Yiannopoulos's success? Maybe it's because Flannery is the only person in the publishing industry willing to stand up for his client?

* Video footage of Marcel Proust [has been discovered](http://www.openculture.com/2017/02/the-first-known-footage-of-marcel-proust-discovered-watch-it-online.html). If In Search of Lost Time was inspired by a cookie, imagine what Proust would have written in response to a clip of archival footage.

* I was [reading this blog that mocks old library books](http://awfullibrarybooks.net/dr-ruth-talks-to-kids/), and the most recent entry is a sexual health guide for youth written by Dr. Ruth Westheimer. The writer, Holly Hibner, writes, "The cover image attached features an endearing but very old lady who looks way too much like my grandma." The fact that young writers don't know who Dr. Ruth is makes me feel very, very old. One day, Hibner will probably be reading a post written by a young writer mocking one of Dan Savage's books. On that day, she might understand how I feel right now. That is all.

* Most comics blogs only cover actual comics news less than a third of the time, [Heidi MacDonald at The Beat discovered](http://www.comicsbeat.com/breaking-news-only-30-of-the-news-on-comics-news-sites-is-actually-about-comics/). The rest of the posts are about "toys, wrestling, video games and what I’d call 'related business news' like conventions, collectibles and human interest."

* I loved reading [this super-nerdy post](http://deltasdnd.blogspot.com/2017/02/spells-through-ages-unseen-servant-and.html) tracking the changes of a minor-but-useful spell through the many editions of *Dungeons & Dragons*.
