* The Seattle Public Library [has announced](https://shelftalkblog.wordpress.com/2017/02/14/for-the-love-of-data-an-open-data-release/) that they've made public a dataset which "includes a count of checkouts by month of both physical and digital items, and spans from 2005 to the present." [You can find that list here](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Checkouts-by-Title/tmmm-ytt6/data).

* The [Nebula Awards ballot has been announced](http://nebulas.sfwa.org/correction-sfwa-nebula-awards-ballot/). We couldn't be more pleased to announce that *Seattle Review of Books* contributor Nisi Shawl's novel *Everfair* is on the ballot for best novel. We're bummed to see that Seattle author Cat Rambo's short work "Red in Tooth and Cog" was bumped from the novelette category because it's a little too short to meet the word count.

* [A novel by Walt Whitman has been discovered](http://www.vulture.com/2017/02/long-lost-walt-whitman-novel-has-been-found-165-years-later.html). (To quibble: At 36,000 words, it's more of a novella than a novel.) It sounds positively Dickensian:

<blockquote>...*Life and Adventures of Jack Engle*, is a first-person narrative following an orphan on his journey through New York, which included a full cast of colorful, diabolical money-and-power-hungry characters, as well as “virtuous Quakers” and a “sultry Spanish dancer.” Researchers believe that the work was never reprinted after it was published anonymously in the New York–area newspaper The Sunday Dispatch.</blockquote>

* You should apply to be [the Mall of America's writer-in-residence](http://www.avclub.com/article/you-could-be-charles-bukowski-mall-america-250694).

* Sometimes you just need a title to know that you should read something: "[Xenu’s Paradox: The Fiction of L. Ron Hubbard and the Making of Scientology](https://longreads.com/2017/02/01/xenus-paradox-the-fiction-of-l-ron-hubbard/)
