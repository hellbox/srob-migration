<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1458184913709/creativetarot.gif)</p> We've [already told you](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/09/bookslut-is-shutting-down/) that Jessa Crispin is shutting down her book review and news site, Bookslut, after 14 years. This is very sad. The good news is that Crispin reads in Seattle tomorrow night from her new book, *The Creative Tarot*. She'll be [reading at University Book Store at 7 pm, and it's free](https://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=03&evyear=2016&eventid=2016021108384500). And meanwhile, over at the Rumpus, you should [read this interview with Crispin](http://therumpus.net/2016/03/the-rumpus-interview-with-jessa-crispin/) that, while recorded before the announcement of Bookslut's closure, certainly seems to offer some foreshadowing to the fact that Crispin is ready to move on:



<blockquote><p>**Rumpus**: Do you dislike American literature?</p>

<p>**Crispin**: Oh my god, so much, right now? Are you fucking kidding me? I haven’t read a novel that’s come out of America that I thought had any value whatsoever since Kathryn Davis’s Duplex, which was two years ago, and there had been a drought before that as well. I think American literature is in a tedious place, horrible place. I can’t even engage with it.</p></blockquote>

* Seattle poetry statisticians the Vis-a-Vis Society have [published some of their most recent work](http://visavissociety.org/2016/03/16/vis-a-vis-societys-new-video-poem-an-homage-to-spaghetti-westerns-and-sergio-leone/) on their website. Recent projects include a race between ending phrases and a spaghetti western.

* Zainab Akhtar, founder of the popular comics criticism blog [Comics & Cola](http://www.comicsandcola.com/), announced that she's shutting down the blog because the culture has become too "toxic."

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Being a woman, being Muslim, being brown, and writing about comics in a culture that is inherently hostile to your presence- I&#39;m empty</p>&mdash; Zainab Akhtar (@comicsandcola) <a href="https://twitter.com/comicsandcola/status/710212352143171586">March 16, 2016</a></blockquote>


* Director Michael Mann is [launching a publishing imprint](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/03/16/heat-book) called Michael Mann Books. One of the first books will be a prequel to Mann's film *Heat*.

* If you read [this story about awesome publisher Dalkey Archive Press's recent move to Texas](http://artsandculturetx.com/dalkey-archive-press/) and you don't fall immediately in love with Dalkey Archive Press, you're probably on the wrong website.
