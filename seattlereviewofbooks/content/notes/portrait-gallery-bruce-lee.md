<h5>Get painted by Christine!</h5>

Christine is taking on a limited amount of commissioned portraits, in her _Seattle Review of Books_ style, in advance of the holidays. If you want a portrait of a friend, loved one, pet, or even yourself (immortalize your bossest selfie!) for your own wall, or as the most thoughtful gift you can possibly imagine, [then please do reach out. There's more information on her website](http://www.christinelarsen.com/sketchbook/2016/9/30/portrait-commissions.html).
