Yesterday, Seattle's outgoing Civic Poet, Claudia Castro Luna, announced the publication of her [Seattle Poetic Grid](http://seattlepoeticgrid.com/). It's a map of the city, with site-specific poems interlaid over it. I encourage you to go check it out; there's lots of good stuff there, from classic seattle poems by Richard Hugo and Denise Levertov to newer poems by Julene Tripp Weaver (about University Village, of all places) and Elizabeth Austen and Lena Khalaf Tuffahha.

We'll be digging deeper into the Poetic Grid in weeks to come, but for right now you should investigate it yourself, share your favorite poems online, and contribute your own Seattle-centric poems to Castro Luna.
