<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday, October 25: *Where the Past Begins* Reading**</h5></p>

Back when she was touring for the very first time, *The Joy Luck Club* author Amy Tan was heartened to receive a huge audience at her Elliott Bay Book Company reading in Seattle. She’s packed them in ever since, and even though she’s a bestselling author dozens of times over now, Seattle still holds a special place in her heart. Tonight, she debuts her memoir.
*Seattle Public Library, 1000 4th Ave., 386-4636, http://spl.org. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday, October 26: *Boyfriends* Launch Party**</h5></p>

Tara Atkinson, a creator of the much-missed APRIL Festival, has published a new novella (or is it a novelette?) titled *Boyfriends* with online-only literary publisher Instant Future. Atkinson has been requesting that people send her photos of their boyfriends on social media, so we’ll likely see the results of that campaign at the party tonight.

*Vermillion Art Gallery and Bar, 1508 11th Ave., 709-9797, http://vermillionseattle.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday, October 27th: Sherman Alexie Loves: Nikki Giovanni**</h5></p>
Sherman Alexie’s ongoing Seattle Arts & Lectures series continues with a spotlight on children’s author and poet Nikki Giovanni, who enjoyed a surprising second act as a hip-hop star. Giovanni most recently published a confessional collection titled *A Good Cry: What We Learn from Tears and Laughter*, which could practically serve as a second title for Alexie’s memoir, *You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me*.
*Benaroya Hall,  200 University St., 215-4747, http://lectures.org. $35. All ages. 7:30 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday, October 28: *Pashmina* Reading**</h5></p>

*Third Place Books Seward Park, 5041 Wilson Ave S, 474-2200, http://thirdplacebooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday, October 29: *Smile* Reading**</h5></p>

Beloved novelist Roddy Doyle (author of *The Commitments* and the fabulously titled *Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha*) returns to town with a new novel that’s all about memory. One day, an old Irish man who’s trapped in his routines is approached by a man from his past — a man he has no memory of meeting. Is he starting to lose his mind?

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday, October 30: *Leonardo Da Vinci* Reading**</h5></p>
Walter Isaacson has made a career out of writing about geniuses. He’s written books about Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Benjamin Franklin. His latest book is a biography of one of history’s most important geniuses: Leonardo Da Vinci. How does one man paint several of the most recognizable paintings of all time, make world-changing discoveries in anatomy and biology, and craft a flying machine in just one lifetime?
