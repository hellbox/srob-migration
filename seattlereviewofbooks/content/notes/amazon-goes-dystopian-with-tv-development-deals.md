Holy cow: [Amazon announced yesterday](https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/29/16384276/snow-crash-series-amazon-ringworld-lazarus) that they're adapting Seattle author Neal Stephenson's sci-fi classic *Snow Crash* into a TV series. And they also announced that they're adapting Portland comics writer Greg Rucka's comic with artist Michael Lark, the dystopian bioengineering epic *Lazarus*, as a series, too. And they *also* announced that they're adapting Larry Niven's *Ringworld* series into a TV series. I can't say that I think *Snow Crash* should be a series — I don't even know if it would be an effective movie; I think it's better left as a novel that was ahead of its time when it was published — but the other two are ripe for serialized storytelling. As much as I hate to admit it, I think Amazon's television arm is really on to something here.
