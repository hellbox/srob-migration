The cantaloupe sits<br>
on the counter like<br>
a little moon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swatted<br>
off its course. 

Outside, grassy<br>
undertones<br>
and modest navel, 

inside, a wall<br> 
of pale orange fruit<br>
and inside that<br>
a child's night terror

of seeds and guts and string.<br>

It is no matter:<br>
The kitchen has<br>
its own astronomy.<br>
The instant the cutting edge

pierces the rind &mdash; flesh<br> 
yielding to steel &mdash;<br>

the gig is up.<br>
We simply eat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the rain<br>
arrests itself. A false sun<br>
flourishes for the afternoon.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside his bus

the busdriver sighs<br>
ignoring if just<br>
for an hour, the terrible<br>
pair of pants<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knockkneed and<br>
abandoned in<br>
the empty seat.


How to hold it<br>
all together: the violence<br>
of the harvest, the embarrassment<br>
of the blade. In his heart

of hearts, the buzzard<br>
knows he is digestible.<br>
He scans the plain:<br>
Too much wild life.

He shakes the daylight<br>
off his wings<br>
and waits for the earth<br>
to cough up the fruit,<br>
for the night to bring<br>
the knife.
