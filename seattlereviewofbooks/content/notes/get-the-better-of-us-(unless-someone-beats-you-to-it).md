Next week, and starting August 22, we have slots open for sponsorships, the first openings until October. If you are considering trying our program, both of these are discounted and might be good options. First come first serve &mdash; sign up on our [Sponsorship page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/).
