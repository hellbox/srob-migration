&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I surprise the women<br>
dressed in their bodies: in breasts,<br>
knees, eyebrows, pubic<br>
hair. Excitable children appear<br>
to accept them. Pitted and fat, dazzling<br>
and golden, the women<br>
drowse under the shower, a preview of<br>
bodies the children try on<br>
with their eyes. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sixty-five, I am less than<br>
a child, whose mother walked<br>
fearfully clothed, afraid of the water.<br>
My grip on the towel gives me away. I move<br>
into the pool suitably over my head<br>
past my mother's responsible<br>
daughter. Later, wild to learn, I practice<br>
standing alone &mdash; only my underpants on &mdash;<br>
under the gun<br>
of the hair dryer. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A queen-size woman<br>
sweetly accosts me, recommends<br>
more clothes. Someone has pointed out<br>
a peekaboo crack in the men's<br>
locker room. "What a shame," she intones,<br>
"such a nice clean<br>
club." I loiter in my underwear<br>
worn out with surveillance.<br>
What we don't know<br>
won't hurt us.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, but it does deprive us!<br>
These ravenous mermaids<br>
stripped to their scales, swim from<br>
the framed reproductions, pale and diaphanous<br>
planes engineered for unmistakable<br>
languor. Something has changed<br>
in the changing room where we step out of<br>
lingerie meant for the fainting couch<br>
and bring on the body in person.
