* Got a press release from Third Place Books yesterday that deserves a signal boost. Here are the opening paragraphs:

<blockquote><p>This Saturday (10/21/17), Third Place Books will donate 20 percent of sales at all three of its store locations (Laker Forest Park, Ravenna, and Seward Park) to relief efforts in Puerto Rico, which has been devastated by Hurricane Maria.</p>
 
<p>Proceeds will go to Unidos Disaster Relief Fund, sponsored by the Hispanic Federation, an organization that Consumer Reports says “has been reviewed and received high ratings from two of the watchdogs, Charity Navigator and BBB Wise Giving Alliance.”</p></blockquote>

* Of all the reasons to pull a book from a school, "It makes people uncomfortable" is maybe the worst. The book? [*To Kill a Mockingbird*](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/10/14/mississippi_school_district_pulls_to_kill_a_mockingbird_because_it_makes.html). The school? It's in Biloxi, Mississippi.

* [This *Wall Street Journal* story](https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-publishers-go-back-to-basics-1507983856) about the decline of e-book sales and the smartening-up of physical book publishers is a feel-good story for people who love physical books. But it's important to remember that everything is not hunky-dory in booksville. Chain retailers are disappearing. Publishers are merging and re-merging and swallowing each other up to the point where we might have a corporate publishing monopoly in the next decade or so. I hate to rain on the parade, but now is not the time for a victory lap. Now is the time to be vigilant.
