Just a quick note to remind you that [tomorrow night at 7 p.m., we'll be at Third Place Books Seward Park to discuss Masha Gessen's *The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin*](http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/reading-through-it-book-club-man-without-face-unlikely-rise-vladimir-putin). Reading this book at this particular time in history has been especially weird: without mentioning Trump at all, the book has been incredibly informative about current events.

Also, I'd urge you to [listen to today's episode of the *Ezra Klein Show*](https://soundcloud.com/ezra-klein-show/masha-gessen-offers-a-plausible-trump-russia-theory), which features a brand-new long interview with Gessen. We'll have so much to discuss tomorrow. I hope to see you then.
