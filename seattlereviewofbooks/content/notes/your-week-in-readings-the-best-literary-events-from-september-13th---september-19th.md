Jamie Ford, the Seattle author who previously wrote a celebrated novel about the International District, returns with a novel about Seattle’s 1909 World’s Fair. It’s the story of a boy who is raffled off to a supposedly “good home” that turns out to be a brothel.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday, September 17th: The Great Book Larder Bake-Off**</h5></p> 
This event is sold out, but there is a standby list, so there’s a chance you might get in. It’s a baking competition loosely based on the hit TV show the *Great British Bake Off*. Today’s event is themed around savory baked goods, and the winner receives a $50 gift certificate to the Larder.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday September 18th: *The Twelve-Mile Straight* Reading**</h5></p> 
In case you weren’t already aware, the South is deeply fucked up. Aside from being badly beaten in the Civil War and never really getting over it, there’s a roots-deep racism that infects everything. Eleanor Henderson’s second novel is set in rural Georgia in the year 1930, which was an especially fucked up time.
