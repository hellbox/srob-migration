Samantha Cole [writes at Motherboard](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjpjn4/amazon-erotica-best-seller-rankings-removed):

<blockquote>In the last few days, word has spread among independent erotica authors on social media that Amazon was quietly changing its policies for erotic novels. Five authors I spoke to, and several more on social media, have reported that their books were stripped of their best seller rankingsâ€”essentially hiding them from casual browsing on the site, and separating them from more mainstream, safe-for-work titles.</blockquote>

Coincidentally, serial-fiction app Radish has also just eliminated all erotica from its digital shelves. [Nate Hoffelder at the Digital Reader writes](https://the-digital-reader.com/2018/03/29/radish-bans-erotica-from-its-serial-fiction-app/):

<blockquote>According to Andrew Shaffer and a number of other people on Twitter, Radish has sent an email to writers who sell stories in the app that is changing its content policy. In order to comply with Apple's content policy for the iTunes app store, Radish is removing all erotica from its app.</blockquote>

You know who still has erotica available for you to buy? Your local independent bookstore.
