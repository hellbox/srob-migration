*SRoB* has already declared what we believe to be [the best-looking literary events of the week](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/17/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-the-week-of-august-17-august-23/), but there are a couple of **music-themed literary fundraisers** coming up that we want you to know about. 

Tomorrow night, the good folks behind Lit Crawl are throwing [a 90's-themed dance party at Fred Wildlife Refuge](https://www.facebook.com/events/878837925503492/), as a way to raise money for the (entirely free) Crawl. It's $5 at the door. As the invitation puts it:

<blockquote>sweet 90s nostalgia + raffle + silent auction + dance off + good feelings + anticipation for the big event on October 22</blockquote>

On Friday, local author-band The Rejections and Trailing Spouses will be [playing a show in Elliott Bay Book Company's reading room](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/seattle7writers-rejections) as a fundraiser for the very worthy [Camp Ten Trees](http://www.camptentrees.org/~camptent/). This event, too, is $5, which includes entry and food and drink.

Even we must acknowledge that life is not best enjoyed through readings alone. Go and get your dance on, and support two worthy causes while you do it.
