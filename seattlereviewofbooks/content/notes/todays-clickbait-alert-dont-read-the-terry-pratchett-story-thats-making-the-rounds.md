Some asshole at the *Guardian* who has never read one of Terry Pratchett's novels thinks Terry Pratchett is overrated. Yep, it's the same old boring "serious literature" conversation, with an added smear on a recently deceased author for good measure. 

This is an obvious plea for attention, **and you should ignore it**. Go read a Terry Pratchett novel instead; if you're unfamiliar with his work, we recommend *Mort* or *The Colour of Magic* to get you started. If you think you really must read this asshole's incendiary comments, [follow this Do Not Link link](http://www.donotlink.com/framed?770655) to the story to find out exactly how dumb it really is. But really, **the correct response to dumb pieces like this is to ignore them**. That's the only way that sites will stop running dumb clickbait. They're literally profiting off your outrage.
