Short Run, the great small-press festival that [local author Kelly Froh](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/sometimes-you-do-the-job-and-sometimes-the-job-does-you/) co-founded, is running [a comics summer school](http://www.shortrun.org/summerschool/) every Monday night in August, with classes including how to computerize your art, screen printing, inking, watercolor, and drawing perspective. Each class is very affordable (Short Run is charging anywhere on a sliding scale from five to 20 dollars per class) and hosted by local cartooning greats including Eroyn Franklin, Robyn Jordan, and Max Clotfelter. If comics are your thing, you should sign up for at least one of these.
