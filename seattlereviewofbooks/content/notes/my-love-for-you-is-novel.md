Back in 2008, Screenwriter [Todd Alcott](http://www.toddalcott.com) looked at a rather unique publishing oddity from the 1970s &mdash; a book-length marriage proposal to consumer advocate Ralph Nader. These days, we'd call it stalking, but in those days the author Amy Devereaux, after her many letters went ignored, published her 165-page proposal (literally titled _Ralph Nader Will You Marry Me?_) in a form that can only be called "epistolary plus". It contained letters, songs, stories, poems, and a musical play titled _Passionate Purple to Ralph Nader, a musical play_. 

She's certainly not the first author whose book was filled with delusional thinking. Hers just happens to be a time-capsule of dated akward cringiness.
