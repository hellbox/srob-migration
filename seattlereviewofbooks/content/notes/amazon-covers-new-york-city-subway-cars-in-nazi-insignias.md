<blockquote><p>Seats on 42nd Street subway Shuttle cars are [wrapped with symbols from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan](http://gothamist.com/2015/11/23/nazi_mta_subway_castle.php), intended to carry commuters into the alternate history of the Amazon TV series, *The Man in the High Castle*, in which the Axis Powers were victorious.</p>

<p>“Half the seats in my car had Nazi insignias inside an American flag, while the other half had the Japanese flag in a style like the World War II design,” said straphanger Ann Toback. “So I had a choice, and I chose to sit on the Nazi insignia because I really didn’t want to stare at it.”</p></blockquote>

In an America where Donald Trump leads the Republican presidential contest by running on a platform of bigotry, fear, and xenophobia, this particular image hits a little bit too close to home.
