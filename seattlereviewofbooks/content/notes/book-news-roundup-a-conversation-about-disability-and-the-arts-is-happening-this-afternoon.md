* Sorry for the late notice, but [today at 4:30 pm](https://www.facebook.com/events/607068906114933/), Seattle author Nicola Griffith will join Riva Lehrer to discus disabilities in arts and culture. [Griffith is a *SRoB* favorite](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/27/talking-with-nicola-griffith-about-the-importance-of-counting-womens-stories/), and disabilities and the arts are not discussed very often in this town. So if you're free this afternoon, you should head up to the Odegaard Undergraduate Library for this event.

* This morning, [the editors of The Toast announced](http://the-toast.net/2016/05/13/we-are-closing-the-toast-july-1st/) that the site will be ending on July 1st.

<blockquote><p>**NICOLE**: You have a WHOLE OTHER JOB and a book in progress, I think youâ€™ll stay busy. Oh, let me state for the record that we do not do NOT want anyone to start a Save The Toast campaign of any kind, even though it would be so obviously lovely and kind of you! We are done.</p>

<p>**MALLORY**: No Kickstarters, please. If you start one I promise I will waste every single penny sent my way on expensive single-serving cakes and various perfumed unguents designed to enhance my beauty.</p></blockquote>

* The shortlist for the Caine Prize for African Writing has been released. If you'd like to learn more about African literature, you [can't really go wrong with this list](http://caineprize.com/2016-shortlist/).

* Cartoonist Chester Brown's latest book, *Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus*, [confused the hell out of *SRoB* co-founder Martin Mcclellan and I](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/theres-something-about-mary/). But maybe we're not the only ones who were confused: comics blog The Beat discovered that Brown [seems to have admitted](http://www.comicsbeat.com/chester-brown-vs-the-bible-the-final-chapter/) accidentally misinterpreting a Bible passage in such a way that it furthered his own thesis. Of course, this doesn't invalidate Brown's book, but it does add another complicated layer to a book that is already made up of complicated layers.

* I mean, these [digital pop-up books](http://www.teleread.com/spellbound-uses-augmented-reality-to-turn-childrens-books-into-digital-pop-up-books/) look fun and everything, but aren't real pop-up books a lot cooler than these? Just saying.

* If you ever wanted to read *The Communist Manifesto* but thought it had way too many words, the [good folks at Crooked Timber](http://crookedtimber.org/2016/05/13/the-communist-manifesto-in-pictures/) have found [a PDF of a 1948 *Illustrated Communist Manifesto*](http://ucf.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/ucf%3A5057). Some of the drawings in this thing are truly incredible.
