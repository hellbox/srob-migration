It's time again for GiveBIG, the one-day nonprofit fundraising event in which local charitable organizations batter your inbox in hopes of a donation. Many of these organizations rely on GiveBIG to raise a large portion of their annual funds, and lots of them have acquired additional matching funds to maximize your donation, so you really should consider donating if you can afford it.

Here is a list of local literary nonprofits that could use your support. Please note that many of these organizations could easily be categorized in two or three different listings — Hugo House, for instance, does writing education, but it's also a venue and a performance hub — so please look through the whole list before making your donation.

<p class="noindent">That's what we have. Go forth, give big, and remember to spread the wealth. It's hard out there for nonprofits.</p>

<p class="footer">NOTE: Last year, the *Seattle Review of Books* was the first to report that [the GiveBIG website entirely failed](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/05/03/a-quick-note-on-problems-with-givebig/). Giving continued into a second day after administrators failed to get the site online during the first 24-hour period. Hopefully, they'll avoid those problems this year. We'll let you know if we hear of any troubles. If you're a nonprofit and you're experiencing any difficulties with the GiveBIG site, please send me an email: paul@seattlereviewofbooks.com.</p>
