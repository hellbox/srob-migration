* It's the beginning of book list season, which is a holiday that I must admit kind of befuddles me. I'm not a list-maker. I find lists to be very unsatisfying. But many of you like them, and that is, of course, okay. I'd like to direct your attention to two of the biggest lists of the season: The New York Public Library has published [its list of the top books for kids and teens](https://www.nypl.org/press/press-release/november-23-2016/new-york-public-library-reveals-its-list-best-books-kids-and) and the *New York Times* published their [100 Notable Books of 2016](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/books/review/100-notable-books-of-2016.html?_r=0). If you like your lists to be shorter and more local, the Seattle Public Library has published [a terrific list of three "Bus Reads for November."](https://shelftalkblog.wordpress.com/2016/11/29/bus-reads-for-november/) I'm not going to link to every list on this site, but I'll make note of the especially worthy ones in days to come.

* *Hamilton* creator [Lin-Manuel Miranda has announced](http://deadline.com/2016/11/lin-manuel-miranda-the-kingkiller-chronicle-movie-tv-show-1201861224/) that he's producing a TV and movie series based on the popular Kingkiller Chronicle fantasy trilogy.

* An Amazon employee [leapt from a building on the online booksellers' South Lake Union campus](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Amazon-worker-leaps-from-building-at-Seattle-10640986.php) yesterday after emailing a number of Amazon employees including founder Jeff Bezos. The person is in medical care with "non-threatening injuries."
