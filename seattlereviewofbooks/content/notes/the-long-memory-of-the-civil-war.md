<p class="noindent">Our sponsor this week is Nick K Adams, and his book _My Dear Wife and Children: Civil War Letters From a 2nd Minnesota Volunteer_ is a remarkable document. Adams has transcribed his great-grandfather's letters about going to war, and offered context and editorial notes to help explain his experience.</p>

The letters span a number of years, from their author, David Brainard Griffin, signing up, through battles and the pain of missing a family when away at war. It's a moving, startling document, remembering just what soldiers have gone through, just as long as we've had wars. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">You can read excerpts from two letters on our sponsor's page</a>. This book would be a great holiday gift for that person on your holiday list who loves history, and for whom the Civil War might hold some contemporary parallels.
