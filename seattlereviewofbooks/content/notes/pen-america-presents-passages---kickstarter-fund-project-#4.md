<p class="intro">Every week, the _Seattle Review of Books_ backs a Kickstarter, and writes up why we picked that particular project. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/08/announcing-the-seattle-review-of-books-kickstarter-fund/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Announcing the Seattle Review of Books Kickstarter Fund">Read more about the project here</a>. Suggest a project by writing to _kickstarter_ at this domain, or by <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - About the Seattle Review of Books">using our contact form</a>.<p>

<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">_[PEN America presents Passages](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/penamerican/pen-america-presents-passages)_. We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[PEN America](http://www.pen.org/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>A new literary translation series featuring contemporary voices from around the world.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	PEN American Center is a longstanding (since 1922!) org working to advance literature and defend free expression. Since 2005, they've been hosting the PEN World Voices Festival of International Literature.
</p>

<p>
	According to them, in the US only 3% of books published are works in translation, and only nine languages account for 90% of the world's translations. They're doing work to make sure international arts are represented. 
</p>
<p>
	_Passages_ will be a literary journal where each issue features a different region in translation. They've aready produced <a href="http://www.pen.org/passages-africa">Africa</a>, and Brazil and Mainland China are next. 
</p>


<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">Books are the greatest machines of empathy in the world. If you're feeling like your literature is staid, or you're tired of reading the same sorts of stories each week, or seeing the same sorts of covers coming out of the New York publishing houses, get a different perspective by backing this.</p>

Scroll _waaaaaaay_ down past all the 1-backer options (which are a little silly, but Kickstarter doesn't allow you to alter your pledges after they are backed) and get to that little gem of reward: $35 for all three issues mentioned above. That's where you want to be.

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">At 20 days to go, they're 90% funded, so looks like they'll make it. But still, throw your money in. This is a fine deal for a nice set and a good cause. They'll look handsome on your shelf.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
