Cienna Madrid is, despite what some of her friends and family might tell you, a human being. Human beings take vacation in the summer. There will be no new advice column this week, because Cienna Madrid is on vacation.

If you want Cienna Madrid to stop taking vacations, you should email her your best literary etiquette questions. If you keep her engaged and entertained with your emails, she will never leave us again. That address is advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.
