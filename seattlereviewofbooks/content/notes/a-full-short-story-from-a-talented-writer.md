Sponsor Ronna Wineberg generously gave us permission to run an entire short story from her book _Nine Facts That Can Change Your Life_ for her sponsorship this week. The story, "Bare Essentials", [appears in full on our sponsor's page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships).

The book received great marks in _Kirkus_ and the _Village Voice_, but it's what you think that matters most, which is why a full story is such a treat. Be sure to indulge yourself, and if you like it, click through to pick up the book.

Sponsors like Ronna Wineberg make the _Seattle Review of Books_ possible. Did you know you could sponsor us, as well? Get your stories, or novel, or event in front of our passionate audience.
