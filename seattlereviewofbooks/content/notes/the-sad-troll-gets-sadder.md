Conservative sci-fi troll Theodore Beale, who seemed dumb a few years ago when he [tried to game the Hugo Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Puppies) but now appears to have been a tiny droplet in the imbecilic wave of white male entitlement currently cresting in the culture, is back at it. Beale is currently trolling sci-fi superstar John Scalzi by publishing [a book with a very similar title and cover to Scalzi's new novel, *The Collapsing Empire*](http://io9.gizmodo.com/amazon-pulls-castalia-house-book-for-ripping-off-john-s-1793533638). Scalzi, as i09's Beth Elderkin notes, is a bestselling author and one of the best-known sci-fi authors in the business. Beale is a jealous little mealworm who has finally resorted to publishing literary mockbusters. 

I guess it's true what they say about obsession; it will eat you up from the inside until there's nothing left of you.
