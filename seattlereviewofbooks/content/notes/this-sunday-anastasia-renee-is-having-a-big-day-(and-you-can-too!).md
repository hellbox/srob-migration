These events came in too late for me to add to [our readings calendar](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/11/27/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-november-27th-december-3rd/), but you should definitely know about them: This coming Sunday, December 3rd, Seattle Civic Poet [Anastacia-Renee](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/08/01/anastacia-renee-is-seattles-next-civic-poet/) is hosting two very different events.

The first event, Speak to Me! is billed as "an intergenerational monthly reading series showcasing emerging and seasoned poets," and the reading is "followed by a 30-minute optional writing workshop facilitated by Anastacia-Renee and visiting workshop facilitators." Readers/facilitators at this event include Seattle poets Robert Francis Flor, Jalayna Carter, and the fabulous Quenton Baker. It starts at 1 pm and runs to 3:30, and it's at the Black Zone, which is located at 2301 S. Jackson St. in suite 203.  

Then, Anastacia-Renee will scramble across town to a 5 pm reading she's curating at Open Books in Wallingford. This reading will include Anastacia-Renee's precedessor in the Civic Poet program, [Claudia Castro Luna](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/authors/claudia-castro-luna/). (Castro Luna will become the Washington State Poet Laureate next year.) They'll be joined by Lily Baumgart, who's serving as Seattle's Youth Poet Laureate, and local novelist [Sonora Jha](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/08/15/meet-the-new-writers-at-hugo-house/), who is currently Hugo House's Writer in Residence. And if that's not enough, other readers include the wonderful Jekeva Phillips and Open Books's very first Poet-in-Residence, [Lena Khalaf Tuffaha](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/04/19/event-of-the-week-lena-khalaf-tuffaha-at-elliott-bay-book-company/).

I have already marveled at the fact that [Anastacia-Renee is a dynamo of poetry](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/07/19/literary-event-of-the-week-forget-it-reading-at-elliott-bay-book-company/), but this Sunday is a herculean feat of poetic performance. Do you think you can keep up? She's daring you to try.
