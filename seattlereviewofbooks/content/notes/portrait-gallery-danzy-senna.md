<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday August 14th: *New People* Reading **</h5></p>
Danzy Senna is one of the very most interesting social writers the 21st century has yet to produce. Her long-awaited new novel, *New People*, is about a biracial couple who find themselves divided along lines that they don’t fully comprehend. Senna explodes American conceptions of class and race in ways that will make readers completely uncomfortable.

*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave., 624-6600, [www.elliotbaybook.com](http://elliottbaybook.com). Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*
