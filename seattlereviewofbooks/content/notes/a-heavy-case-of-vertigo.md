Speaking of comics, I barely pay attention to the news that comes out of San Diego Comicon these days because it's become a big Hollywood PR machine. But the SDCC news that DC Comics' adult/creator-owned imprint Vertigo is [launching 12 new titles this fall](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/07/09/sdcc-15-vertigo-adds-a-dozen-new-titles-for-the-fall-including-lucifer/) is very welcome. Vertigo used to publish wonderful comics series on a regular basis, but it's fallen into disrepair over the last decade or so. Some of these names — Darwyn Cooke! Gilbert Hernandez! Mike Allred! Gail Simone! — are very promising, and only one of them (*Lucifer*) appears to be a half-assed *Sandman* ripoff. I like those odds.
