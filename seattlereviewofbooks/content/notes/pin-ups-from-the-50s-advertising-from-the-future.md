<p class="noindent">Our sponsor this week, Martin McClellan, wants you to know he just <a href="https://medium.com/california-four-oclock" title="California Four O’Clock – Medium">published his entire novel to read online for free</a>!</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Wait — isn't he one of the co-founders of this site? </strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Sure is!</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Isn't that a little...unethical?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">How so?</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Well, I mean, he's advertising his own product on the place he runs. Kind of like a conflict-of-interest isn't it?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">No, not really — it's what, in the tech world, they call "eating your own dogfood", or using your own product. He wants to make sure that when other people buy sponsorships — like, maybe to announce their book is online for free, or maybe that they're putting on an amazing event, or just to publish a full chapter from their book on this site so all of our readers can see it and decide if they want to read more of the book — he wants to make sure that when they do that, they'll have a great experience, and feel like the sponsorship was a good value.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>That sounds pretty cool, actually...</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">It is! And because we've just released a new block of sponsorships for the new year — oh 2017, how we have awaited your arrival! — <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">there are six months worth of slots you can grab right now, to make sure you get the slot you want.</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>So, what's the book about?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">It's about pin-up painters and photographers in the 1950s. It's about Twentieth century art, mid-century queer culture, about lust and love and not knowing what you want with your life. It's called _California Four O'Clock_. <a href="https://medium.com/california-four-oclock/chapter-one-los-angeles-1955-f7fe7f492c49#.oenpu699a" title="Chapter One — Los Angeles, 1955 – California Four O’Clock – Medium">Here's Chapter One, on Medium</a>, or check out <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">more information on our sponsors page</a>. Give it a try!</p>

<p class="noindent">And when you're ready, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">book your dates now for your own sponsorship</a>!</p>
