<p class="noindent">Our inspiring sponsor, Susan Marie Conrad, did something many of us want to do, but almost nobody does: she kayaked the entire Inside Passage, from Anacortes to Juneau, Alaska. You and I both know this story is more than just the logistics of paddling, and Conrad delivers a great story in her book _Inside: One Womanâ€™s Journey Though the Inside Passage_. It's well-told, rife with personal accomplishment, and that kind of self-examination that only comes from pitting oneself against nature.</p>

<a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">We have a long, engaging excerpt on our Sponsors page</a>. Please give it a read, and see a few pictures from the trip, as well. If you're like us, you'll want to click through and read the rest of the story. We hope you do.
