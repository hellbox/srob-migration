The antique cards from my great grandmother,<br>
the photographs of ancestors I did not know,<br>
so much regal furniture, I sat in a closed off<br>
parlor, quiet in a King George chair, looked

across the room at the matching couch,<br> 
the grand organ, the gold trimmed tall mirror<br> 
with marble at its base, hung full length<br> 
between tall windows formally draped. 

I loved the quiet in this room, the history I<br>
never understood. The organ no one played,<br> 
out of tune, a museum for far away relatives<br> 
in England or Holland, mother’s side

of the family, who tried to stay wealthy<br>
but exposed to the elements oxidized<br> 
in a slow decline, till it wore thin this family<br>
chain, clear to inevitable death.

So much no one remembers, only two chairs<br>
left, reupholstered, and the mirror, yes, the<br>
mirror, now on sister’s wall in Philadelphia,<br> 
no longer with its marble stand, but it hangs 

a view to see ourselves, how we have walked<br> 
through to this other side &mdash; some of us &mdash; who<br> 
would be us, long disappeared, those still here<br> 
with traces in our blood, on our walls, in the

pictures we grow older and more distant<br> 
every decade &mdash; this rusty chain still present &mdash;<br>
binding like a cross, there is no escape, no matter<br> 
the life we live now.
