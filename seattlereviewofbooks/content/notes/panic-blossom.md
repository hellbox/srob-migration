<p>_[to be read very quickly, as if almost out of breath]_</p>

<p class="prose-poem">Panic blossom speaks passwords into the edge of the voice at the edge of the speech that listens.
 </p> 
<p class="prose-poem">The password for membrane is not squirrels. It is also not squirrels of intestinal magic. It is not</p>

<p>squirrels that ride the antlers of your skin.<br><br></p>

<p class="prose-poem">Every sink will be shallow and the deer with eight legs will run faster but on a treadmill of paper.</p>

<p>There is a password for the membrane. To get out is different from to get in.</p>

<p>The password is glass<br>
The password is glass in a volcano<br> 
The password is clear glass<br>
The glass is cloth<br>
The glass is a cloth of waterfalls<br>
The waterfalls are not the password<br>
The password is not glass</p>

<p class="prose-poem">Squirrels are not the password but they carry the keys. They carry the keys that wilt in the locks. They are leaf keys and they are not passwords.</p>

<p>A squirrel in our story has fallen into a pond.</p>

<p>The water and the squirrel fight their failing.</p>

<p>The water taps the lungs. The ghost leaves a lotus.<br><br></p>

<p>I didn’t know the password. The password was not squirrels.</p>

<p>There was a key but it was waterfalls.</p>
 
<p>Let’s talk about something else.<br><br></p>
 
<p>I barely knew them, but they kissed me everywhere, the squirrels.</p>

<p>It wracked my nerves but gave me purchase<br>
for the password. Here and there a leaf fell down my shirt.<br>
The leaves that cannot open things panic in the lock.</p>
 
<p>The hinge hears the blossom panic in the door.</p>
 
<p>That is the key.</p>
 
<p>The sinks are shallow so no one will drown.</p>
 
<p>The deer is catching up.</p>
 
<p class="prose-poem">Its eight legs in the corner are listening to the edge. At the edge is a boy under glass</p>

<p>who looks through sheets of water.</p>
