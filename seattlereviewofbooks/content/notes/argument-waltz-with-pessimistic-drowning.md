After I try to give you happiness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what you unwrap is box<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of yellowjackets, stinging

nettles, and jellyjars filled with broken glass.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not for the cottonhearted.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is for the man who holds fire

between his fingers and calls it love.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;We are burnt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;toast and prism jam.
    
We are rubbing ourselves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the underside of a fern<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trying to make the stinging stop.

There are remedies everywhere—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from beekeeper’s honey to handmade<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soap—we are told what to hold
    
near our skin. We are the stained<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;towels and the sainted<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bohemian monarch that can’t fly.
    
Or doesn’t want to.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I place a constellation in my hand,<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then complain about the burning.
    
Life weighs me down when I am tired.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s not pretend we have rocks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in our pockets. Though I always pretend
    
I am the novelist and you are the river.
