There are three<br> 
people float<br> 
ing in a<br> 
lake. One does<br> 
not know how<br> 
to swim and<br> 
neither do<br> 
the others<br> 
saying I<br> 
don’t know how<br>
to swim I<br> 
don’t either.<br>
But there. They<br> 
are. They’re float<br> 
ing straight up<br> 
and down so<br> 
the top third<br> 
of each face<br> 
bobs just a<br> 
bove the wa<br> 
ter. These are<br> 
a few of<br> 
my favor<br> 
ite subjects.
