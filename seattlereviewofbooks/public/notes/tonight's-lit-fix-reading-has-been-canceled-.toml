We just received an email from host Mia Lipman that says due to a last-minute emergency, tonight's Lit Fix reading, which [I wrote about this morning](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/03/22/literary-event-of-the-week-lit-fix-fourth-anniversary-party-at-chop-suey/), has been canceled. Apologies to everyone.
