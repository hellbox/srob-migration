<p class="noindent">Sponsor Brian McKreevy's new novel _The Lights_ is being released next week. It's a philosophical inquiry into the nature of how we connect in our most intimate bonds &mdash; and, bonus, it starts when gifted writer Leda Galvan moves to Austin to join an MFA program. It's an examination of love and art, all set in Texas among aspirational writers.</p> 

That's something McKreevy knows all about &mdash; he was a James Michener Fellow in fiction and screenwriting at the University of Texas. He's also the author of _Hemlock Grove_, a gothic novel produced by Netflix into a series. He's "alarmingly talented", and one reviewer said "_The Lights_ is a funny and honest look at how we negotiate our own morality on a sliding scale."
