As we have noted repeatedly, this Thursday is Lit Crawl Seattle. But it's also important to note that Alison Bechdel [will be reading at Town Hall in a sold-out edition](https://townhallseattle.org/event/an-evening-with-alison-bechdel/) of the 2015-2016 Seattle Arts and Lectures reading series. If you haven't yet read Bechdel's *Fun Home* or *Dykes to Watch Out For*, [this excellent essay by Seattle writer Corinne Manning at Literary Hub](http://lithub.com/myself-in-translation-on-the-genius-of-alison-bechdel/) explains her particular genius.
