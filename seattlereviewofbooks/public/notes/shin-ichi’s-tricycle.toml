I stepped down from the trolley that day in Hiroshima<br>
and walked by the river where the children had floated in flames,<br>
but I could not hear their cries of misu, misu. Lost.

I saw the rowboats tied to the shore waiting for the living,<br>
and the Prefecture building as the autumn wind<br>
blew through the skeletal dome and every leaf lay scattered.

I passed by heaps of flowers and burning candles<br>
to the doors that let me in to where the lights were dim,<br>
so many shadows, each display lit only by a row of flashlights.

Power outage, someone said and so I need not pay my yen<br>
but paid another way past fingers dripping skin,<br>
a lunch box full of barley ash, the twisted tricycle

Shin-Ichi’s mother dug from severed earth. She gave it<br>
so the boy would live in memory:<br>
sculptured handlebars and pedals burned to black

all buried by the father who found him lying dead.<br>
I thought of myself at five,<br>
pedaling my tricycle down the middle

of Wilsonia Road, the rainbow shine of oil,<br>
the sun, my father’s call<br>
as he came swooping down to pull me back,

shouting, Don’t ever do that again.<br>
Although of course I would.<br>
And of course we did.
