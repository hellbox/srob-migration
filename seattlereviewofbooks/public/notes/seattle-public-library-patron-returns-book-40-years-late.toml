Seattle Public Library tweeted this over the weekend:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">40 year overdue Seattle Public Library book with note, &quot;Sorry I just cleaned my bedroom closet...&quot; Due Date JUN 15, 76 <a href="https://t.co/luJDzf6f69">pic.twitter.com/luJDzf6f69</a></p>&mdash; Seattle Library (@SPLBuzz) <a href="https://twitter.com/SPLBuzz/status/817876473700872193">January 7, 2017</a></blockquote>

It's nowhere near the most overdue book of all time — [George Washington took out a book that was returned 221 years later](http://mentalfloss.com/article/55621/11-ridiculously-overdue-library-books-were-finally-returned) — but it's still quite impressive.
