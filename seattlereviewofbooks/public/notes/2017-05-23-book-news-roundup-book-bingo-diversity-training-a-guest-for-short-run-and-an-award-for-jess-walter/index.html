<li><p>Does your organization need diversity training? If you&rsquo;re an arts organization in Seattle, the answer is probably yes. This Saturday in the <a href="http://2100building.com/">2100 Building</a> at 1:30 p.m., two local artists with lots of experience in the topic are hosting a &ldquo;public discussion about the pros and cons of working with professionals, consultants, and hands-on-experts to facilitate an anti-racist work environment.&rdquo; Entry fees range from $5 to $20, though nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/838776766270685/?acontext=%7B%22action_history%22%3A%22[%7B%5C%22surface%5C%22%3A%5C%22messaging%5C%22%2C%5C%22mechanism%5C%22%3A%5C%22attachment%5C%22%2C%5C%22extra_data%5C%22%3A%7B%7D%7D]%22%7D">confirm for the event on Facebook</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Short Run <a href="http://shortrun.org/special-guest-announcement-julia-wertz/?platform=hootsuite">has announced a new special guest</a> for their November festival: cartoonist Julia Wertz. You should be excited about this news: Wertz is a spectacular comics memoirist (you should read <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781927668269"><em>Drinking at the Movies</em></a>) who is moving into a new phase of her career with illustrations of American city streets, many of which will be collected in a book this fall titled <em>Tenements, Towers &amp; Trash: An Unconventional Illustrated History of New York City</em>. Wertz has gone from the creator and star of an online strip called <em>The Fart Party</em> to a regularly published cartoonist at the <em>New Yorker</em>. The Short Run Festival happens at Seattle Center this year on Saturday, November 4th.</p></li>

<li><p>Spokane novelist Jess Walter will be <a href="https://www.humanities.org/blog/jess-walter-martha-kongsgaard-receive-humanities-washington-award/">given the Humanities Washington Award this October</a> for his &ldquo;commitment to nurturing creativity&rdquo; and his lifelong dedication to the humanities.</p></li>

<li><p>It&rsquo;s Summer Book Bingo time again at Seattle Public Library! Here&rsquo;s how it works: <a href="http://www.spl.org/audiences/adults/summer-book-bingo">download a bingo card from their website</a> or pick one up at your neighborhood library. Then, read books that meet the criteria on the bingo card (categories include &ldquo;adapted into a movie,&rdquo; &ldquo;published the year one of your parents was born,&rdquo; and much more). Check those books off on your card. If you fill your card and turn it in, you could win a collection of books from authors who are coming to town for <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/04/26/seattle-arts-and-lectures-celebrates-its-30th-anniversary-with-a-slate-of-authors-including-pulitzer-winners-tyehimba-jess-viet-thanh-nguyen-and-colson-whitehead/">Seattle Arts &amp; Lectures&rsquo; 2017-2018 season</a>, along with tickets for every one of SAL&rsquo;s upcoming shows.</p></li>

<li><p>The Seattle Globalist is <a href="http://www.seattleglobalist.com/2017/05/22/apply-today-2017-seattle-globalist-summer-internship/65569">looking for a summer intern</a>.</p></li>
