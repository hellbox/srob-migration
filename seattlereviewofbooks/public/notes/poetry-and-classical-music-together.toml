Seattle Poet and writer Esther Altshul Helfgott returns as this week's sponsor, and we're thrilled to have her. She's going to be appearing March 6th in an event featuring the music of Mozart intersersed with Esther reading from her book _Listening to Mozart: poems of Alzheimer's_. 

[Find out more on our sponsors page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships), and read the first part of Esther's _Listening to Mozart_, to get a feel for her direct, and lyrical, approach to processing pain and loss.

If you're a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, [take a look at our open dates](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/). We'd love to talk to you about opportunities to sponsor us.
