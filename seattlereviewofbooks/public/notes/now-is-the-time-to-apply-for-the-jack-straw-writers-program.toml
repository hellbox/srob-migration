You have two months to [apply for Jack Straw's 2016 Writers Program](http://www.jackstraw.org/programs/asp/2016/WP2016_application.shtml). Don't know what that is? I'll let them explain:

<blockquote>Twelve writers, selected by an invited curator, create new work during the residency to be presented through live readings, recorded interviews, a published anthology, and as podcasts on our web site. Participants also receive professional training in voice and microphone technique, performance and delivery, and interviews.</blockquote>

Previous Jack Straw writers include Rebecca Hoogs and David Schmader. And this year's program curator is local poet Karen Finneyfrock, who is both an excellent writer and a brilliant reader of her own work, which means that if she selects you for the program, you *know* you've got something special going on with your bad self. You literally have nothing to lose. [Go apply today](http://www.jackstraw.org/programs/asp/2016/WP2016_application.shtml), and then spend the next two months thinking about all the ways you'll be able to share your work with a solid year of Jack Straw's training.
