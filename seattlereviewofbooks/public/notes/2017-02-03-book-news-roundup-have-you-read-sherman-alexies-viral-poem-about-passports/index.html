<li><p>&ldquo;I dreamed that my passport was a book of prayers,&rdquo; Sherman Alexie writes in <a href="http://www.earlybirdbooks.com/autopsy-poem-sherman-alexie/">his new poem &ldquo;Autopsy&rdquo; at Early Bird Books</a>. &ldquo;Autopsy&rdquo; is a deeply political poem that was born from this political moment, like Elisa Chavez&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/01/03/revenge/">Revenge</a>&rdquo; and Claudia Castro Luna&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/01/31/am-i-not-an-immigrant/">Am I not an immigrant?</a>,&rdquo; both  of which were published right here on the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>. It is incredibly heartening to see poets making something out of this despair, and to see the general public respond to these poems with such enthusiasm. Donald Trump&rsquo;s election has made the viral protest poem into a thing.</p></li>

<li><p>JK Rowling has been battling Trump trolls on Twitter, and it&rsquo;s glorious:</p></li>

<li><p>And since we&rsquo;re speaking of Twitter, <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/k6U9E">a screenshot of a Twitter thread</a> about a librarian who solved a dirty trick involving a young woman&rsquo;s homework assignment has been making the rounds. It&rsquo;s a great example of the importance of librarians and research and not jumping to conclusions.</p></li>

<li><p>Seattle Rising is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/237700876683881/">a reading/protest happening at Westlake Center tomorrow (Saturday) at 6 pm</a>. Its stated goal is to ensure that &ldquo;attendees, rather than paid speakers representing large organizations, [take] the floor. You can sign up for your 3 minutes at the tech table on the day of the event.&rdquo;</p></li>
