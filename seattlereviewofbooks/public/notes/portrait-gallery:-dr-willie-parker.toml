**Tuesday June 6th: *Life’s Work* Reading**</p>

<p class="noindent">
Shout Your Abortion is presenting Dr. Willie Parker at a special Town Hall event this coming Tuesday, and attendance is required for anyone who thinks a woman’s right to choose is essential for the future of this country. At this special event to celebrate the publication of *Life’s Work*, Parker will be introduced by Seattle celebrity Lindy West, who helped Amelia Bonow get SYA off the ground, and Parker will be interviewed by staunch SYA ally Martha Plimpton, who appeared most recently as the mom in the sitcom *The Real O’Neals*. Don’t expect anyone, onstage or in attendance, to be ashamed about their passion for a woman’s right to safe and legal abortion.<br />*Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $15. All ages. 7 p.m.*
