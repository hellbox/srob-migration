        <p>This year&rsquo;s Black List Awards, which celebrate the greatest unproduced screenplays, were announced yesterday. Coincidentally, two Black List winners share a very interesting muse. Here&rsquo;s a description of Kathy Charles&rsquo;s screenplay <em>The Kings of Maine</em>:</p>

<blockquote>Living with his wife and child in a trailer while working as a janitor, Stephen King struggles with alcoholism and his own dark history as he attempts to complete Carrie.</blockquote>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the plot synopsis for <em>Maximum King!</em>, by Shay Hatten:</p>

<blockquote>An outlandish, surreal imagining of how in 1985 Stephen King wrote and directed his horror classic MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE.</blockquote>

<p>We could be about to enter a Stephen King renaissance; from biopics to absurdist comedy, something about King is in the zeitgeist right now.</p>
