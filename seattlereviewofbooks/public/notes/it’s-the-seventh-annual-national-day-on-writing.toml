Every October 20th a coalition of partners like the _New York Times_, the [_National Writing Project_](http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/events/878?x-t=sites_eos.view), the [_National Council of Teachers of English_](http://www.ncte.org/dayonwriting), and the [_Teaching Channel_](https://www.teachingchannel.org/blog/2015/10/07/whyiwrite/) come together to encourage writing. They want you to hashtag: [#WhyIWrite](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WhyIWrite&src=tyah). 

I even did one of my own: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WhyIWrite?src=hash">#WhyIWrite</a> Because figuring out how I feel about something requires five or so years and 80,000 or so words.</p>&mdash; Martin McClellan (@hellbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/hellbox/status/656582696211058688">October 20, 2015</a></blockquote> 

The whole thing was inspired by [Orwell’s famous essay](http://orwell.ru/library/essays/wiw/english/e_wiw), whose title inspired the hashtag. Here’s part of how he put it, and below him, some of today’s writers from today’s hashtag: 

<blockquote>
What I have most wanted to do throughout the past ten years is to make political writing into an art. My starting point is always a feeling of partisanship, a sense of injustice. When I sit down to write a book, I do not say to myself, ‘I am going to produce a work of art’. I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing. But I could not do the work of writing a book, or even a long magazine article, if it were not also an aesthetic experience. Anyone who cares to examine my work will see that even when it is downright propaganda it contains much that a full-time politician would consider irrelevant. I am not able, and do not want, completely to abandon the world view that I acquired in childhood. So long as I remain alive and well I shall continue to feel strongly about prose style, to love the surface of the earth, and to take a pleasure in solid objects and scraps of useless information. It is no use trying to suppress that side of myself. The job is to reconcile my ingrained likes and dislikes with the essentially public, non-individual activities that this age forces on all of us.
