Cienna Madrid is taking Labor Day weekend off. She will return next week. If you can't go a single Friday without a Help Desk — believe me, I know the feeling — we have [a year's worth of columns here for you to enjoy](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-help-desk/). On a related note: we at the *Seattle Review of Books* hope you have a fantastic Labor Day weekend. [We'll see you at Bumbershoot this Sunday](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/_wh_previews/notes/a9e3dd52-7d9a-6edc-5bbb-e6a48f9d00a7/)!

And as always: if you need advice on a literary (or literary-adjacent) matter, please **send Cienna a question at advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com**. Your anonymity is guaranteed. Her advice might not always be what you want to hear, but it is one hundred percent guaranteed to be correct.
