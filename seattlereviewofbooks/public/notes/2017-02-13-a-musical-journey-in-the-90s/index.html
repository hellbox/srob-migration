<p class="noindent">We're so excited to have <a href="https://www.matthewamsterburton.com" title="Matthew Amster-Burton">Matthew Amster-Burton</a> as our sponsor this week. His new novel _Our Secret Better Lives_ is a funny, stirring, and exciting tale. Set in 1994, it's about Katy, a huge music fan on a big adventure to a new state and college, who finds herself doing one thing she never imagined: stepping in front of a microphone in a new band.</p> 

<p><a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">We&rsquo;ve got a full chapter, and more information, on our sponsor&rsquo;s page</a> so you can see just how deftly Matthew handles these engaging characters.

That&rsquo;s when Matthew will be at Ada&rsquo;s Technical Books to talk about the work. But why wait? <a href="http://www.seattletechnicalbooks.com/book/9780998469805" title="Our Secret Better Lives (Paperback) | Ada&amp;#039;s Technical Books">Ada&rsquo;s has the book for sale on their website right now</a>.
