This, which we found on poet [Kelli Russell Agodon's Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/KelliAgodon/status/737732895754747904), is a terrific idea: [poet.tips](http://poet.tips/) recommends poets to you, in the by-now-ubiquitous internet recommendation format of "If you like X, then you'll like Y." The engine stretches from classics...

* [Edna St. Vincent Millay](http://poet.tips/poet/edna_st._vincent_millay/)
* [T.S. Eliot](http://poet.tips/poet/t.s._eliot/)
* [Denise Levertov](http://poet.tips/poet/denise_levertov/)

...to contemporary greats...

* [Patricia Lockwood](http://poet.tips/poet/patricia_lockwood/)
* [Dorothea Lasky](http://poet.tips/poet/dorothea_lasky/)
* [Alice Notley](http://poet.tips/poet/alice_notley/)
* [Eileen Myles](http://poet.tips/poet/eileen_myles/)

...to local favorites:

* [Kelli Russell Agodon](http://poet.tips/poet/kelli_russell_agodon/)
* [Sherman Alexie](http://poet.tips/poet/sherman_alexie/)
* [Karen Finneyfrock](http://poet.tips/poet/karen_finneyfrock/)
* [Maged Zaher](http://poet.tips/poet/maged_zaher/)

Recommendation engines are not the be-all end-all of discovery, of course, but they can send you on some interesting tangents. And there are worse ways to while away the time than typing poet names into a search engine, just to see what connections its algorithm might find.
