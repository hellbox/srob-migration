        <p>We have an <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">opening for a sponsor next week</a>. We&rsquo;d love it to be you. We&rsquo;ve had record traffic with our library coverage &mdash; you could reach out to that crowd to tell them about your book or event. People are starting to rely on the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> for literary coverage; your sponsorship would help make that possible.</p>

<p><em>How&rsquo;s the sponsorship model going so far</em>? Really well! Out of 27 original weeks we opened in this block of availability, only 5 are left. We&rsquo;re ecstatic about this. We&rsquo;d love to see that number go down and down, and <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">maybe with your help</a> we can.</p>

<p>Like we say every week, help us to make <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">internet advertising 100 percent less terrible</a>, and we promise that weâ€™ll make sure the sponsorships we show you are quality works that are interesting to you.</p>
