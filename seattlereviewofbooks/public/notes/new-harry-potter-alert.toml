This is [not a drill](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/10/entertainment/harry-potter-part-8-publish-summer-feat/):

<blockquote>The eighth installment of the Harry Potter series, the two-part play, "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child," will be published as a book this summer, author J.K Rowling announced on her Pottermore website Wednesday.</blockquote>

*Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* will be released on July 31st, which is canonically Harry Potter's birthday. Presumably, it will break all previous sales records for plays.
