        <p>We <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">have a chapter from <em>Now That She&rsquo;s Gone</em></a>, by sponsor Gregg Olsen, for one more day. Be sure to take a look &mdash; you might just get hooked.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why instead of blurbs and jacket copy alone, we offer you a full chapter to read from our sponsors. Just like in a bookstore when you pick up an unknown writer and take a look to see if you like them. We think this is a great way to get exposed to a huge variety of writing, and we&rsquo;re so pleased that Gregg Olsen joined us this week to show you. Take a look, and see if you&rsquo;re not curious <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">about what&rsquo;s gonna happen in chapter 2</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s with sponsors like him that we&rsquo;re working our darndest to make <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Help us make internet advertisements 100 percent less terrible">internet advertising 100 percent less terrible</a>. Thanks to Gregg, we&rsquo;re able to bring you all of the content you read here every week. Help us thank him by giving that chapter a chance.</p>
