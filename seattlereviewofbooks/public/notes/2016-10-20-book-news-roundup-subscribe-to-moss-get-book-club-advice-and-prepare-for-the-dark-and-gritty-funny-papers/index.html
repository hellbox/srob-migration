<li><p><a href="http://www.mosslit.com/vol02/issue05.html"><em>Moss</em></a>, the excellent free Northwest-centric literary magazine, is offering <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mosslit">$20 annual subscriptions through Patreon</a>, which gets you an annual print edition and early access to each quarterly issue of the magazine. This is absolutely a steal. Give if  you can.</p></li>

<li><p>You have until Halloween to apply for the <a href="http://jackstraw.org/programs/asp/2017/2017_apps.shtml">Jack Straw Artist Residency programs</a>, which teach artists how to better use sound as a medium. Most writers are, sad to say, terrible readers of their own work. A program like Jack Straw immediately gives writers an edge over the competition by teaching them how to present their work in a reading, radio, or podcast setting. The writers program curator this year is poet and essayist Jourdan Imani Keith, who it is safe to say knows a thing or two about reading work aloud. <a href="http://jackstraw.org/programs/asp/2017/WP2017_application.shtml">Get your applications in by 5 pm on the 31st</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/06/pushpull-gallery-is-our-january-bookstore-of-the-month/">Push/Pull</a>, up in Ballard, is <a href="http://pushpullseattle.weebly.com/join.html">looking for new members</a> to help run the space. If you&rsquo;re an artist with a lot of work to sell — comics, art, crafts — you should consider joining the team.</p></li>

<li><p>Ebooks were <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/14/penguin-boss-admits-the-company-read-too-much-into-the-ebook-hyp/">not that as big a deal as at least one major publisher thought they&rsquo;d be</a>:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Penguin wrongly lost confidence in the power of the printed word and invested “unwisely” amid the rise of eBooks, one of the company’s bosses has admitted.</blockquote>

<li><p>Mark Haddon <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2016/oct/17/mark-haddon-joins-john-le-carre-and-ian-rankin-in-the-fight-against-amazon">joins the list of big-name authors</a> who are making a case against buying books on Amazon.</p></li>

<li><p>It&rsquo;s kind of hilarious that <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/bob-dylan-plays-hard-to-get-with-nobel-committee.html">the Nobel Committee can&rsquo;t get a hold of Bob Dylan</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/joeturrent/">This poem by Joe Turrent</a> is not extremely successful, but it is interesting: it&rsquo;s an erasure by way of Microsoft Word&rsquo;s &ldquo;track changes&rdquo; feature.</p></li>

<li><p>Now the <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/news/pulitzer-prizes-open-all-journalism-categories-magazines">Pulitzer Prize is open to magazines</a> in all categories. Formerly, only newspapers were eligible for many of the categories. Get ready for the <em>New Yorker</em> and the <em>New York Times</em> to go head-to-head forever.</p></li>

<li><p>This comic-strip reimagining of <em>Watchmen</em> is perhaps the best thing I&rsquo;ve seen on Twitter this month. (Thanks to <em>SRoB</em> tipper <a href="https://twitter.com/E_Steven">@E_Steven</a> for the tip.)</p></li>

<li><p>Novelist Brit Bennett, whose new novel <em>The Mothers</em> is one of the most buzzed-about books of the fall, wrote <a href="https://shelftalkblog.wordpress.com/2016/10/18/a-note-from-brit-bennett-author-of-the-mothers/">a guest post for Seattle Public Library</a> about the importance of libraries in her life.</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of the Seattle Public Library, librarian Misha Stone was on KING 5 the other day talking about book clubs. — what makes book clubs work, what books book clubs are reading these days, and so on It&rsquo;s definitely worth your time:</p></li>
