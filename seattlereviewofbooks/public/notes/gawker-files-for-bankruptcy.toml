Gawker, which started as a literary gossip blog and then became something else again, has [just filed for bankruptcy](http://www.recode.net/2016/6/10/11903764/gawker-bankruptcy-chapter-11-sale-ziff-davis) and might be sold to terribad online publisher Ziff Davis. Now might be a good time for you to read [my review of Brian Abrams's book *Gawker: An Oral History*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/who-gawks-at-the-gawkers/).
