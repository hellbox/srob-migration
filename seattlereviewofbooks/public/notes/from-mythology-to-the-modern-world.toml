<p class="noindent">Sponsor Eric Andrews-Katz's newly released novel Tartarus is a great romp through time, mythology, epic battles, and gay romance. Two siblings, descendants of Olympus, are dragged into ancient battles they didn't know they were responsible for.</p> 

It's a bold, entertaining work with an engaging story that bridges the old and the very new. We've got a [full chapter on our Sponsor's page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) for you to read, and find yourself gripped by this story.
