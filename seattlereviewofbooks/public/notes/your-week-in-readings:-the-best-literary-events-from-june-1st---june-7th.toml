<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday June 3: *Sweetbitter* Reading**</h5></p>
Stephanie Danler’s debut novel is about a young woman who moves to New York City to make it big in the restaurant world. “Eating becomes a discipline language-obsessed,” Danler writes early in *Sweetbitter*. “You will never simply eat food again.” It’s a novel about senses and sensation, which is to say it’s about being alive.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday June 5: *King of the Worlds* Reading**</h5></p>
M. Thomas Gammarino’s new book from Seattle publisher Chin Music Press is a hyperactive science fiction road trip about an actor who loses the lead role in *Titanic* and then travels across time and space in the throes of a “trans-dimensional midlife crisis.” After his reading, I’ll be joining Gammarino for a talk.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Alternate Sunday June 5: *The Face: A Time Code* Reading**</h5></p>
[Ruth Ozeki’s *A Time Code*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/open-faced/) is the best of three debut books in the new series *The Face*, in which authors write book-length essays about their own faces. (I [reviewed it a few months ago](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/open-faced/).) In her outing, Ozeki stares at her own face in the mirror for hours at a time, and records her reaction. It’s a story about meditation, vanity, gender, and aging, from one of the best writers in the Northwest.
*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 3 p.m.* 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday June 6: Ask the Oracle**</h5></p>
This reading series adds an air of mystery to the literary  experience. Audience members ask for advice (Should I leave my boyfriend? Should I move?) and Seattle-area authors divine the answers from their own books. Tonight’s fortune-tellers include poet Jane Wong, essayist David Schmader, and novelist Bruce Holbert.

Jung Young Moon is a prominent experimental South Korean author who is finally debuting a translation of one of his novels in America. *Vaseline Buddha* is about the events surrounding the funeral of a goldfish named Kierkegaard. Moon’s publisher compares him to Kafka or Beckett, and this is an incredibly rare stateside appearance. *Seattle Asian Art Museum, 1400 E. Prospect, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*
