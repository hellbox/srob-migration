<li><p>Hey, Seattle writers! Please remember to apply for the LaSalle Storyteller Award, a fantastic $10,000 award from Artist Trust that goes to &ldquo;an individual literary artist working in fiction.&rdquo; This is a lot of cash with very few strings attached, so it&rsquo;s one of the finer fiction prizes in the region. <a href="http://artisttrust.org/index.php/for-artists/grants#gar_lasalle_storyteller_award">More information at Artist Trust&rsquo;s site</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>You should read <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/sherman-alexie-is-not-the-indian-you-expected?utm_term=.sljKO4vOO#.fr39mG3mm">this terrific profile of Sherman Alexie by Anne Helen Petersen at BuzzFeed</a>:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>There’s a strong overlap between the women of the anti-Trump resistance and Alexie’s readership, which is primarily composed of college-educated white women. Unlike some male authors (see: Jonathan Franzen) who worry that a female audience will feminize their art, and thereby delegitimize it, Alexie embraces his readers. “They pay my mortgage!” he said. “But they’re also just more open to actually crossing boundaries. They have that perfect combination of privilege — because of their whiteness — and oppression, because they’re women. They’re at the forefront of every battle, and they come into it with both strength and weakness, with both power and pain.”</blockquote>

<li><p>If you&rsquo;re into best-of lists, Vulture has published a listicle of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.vulture.com/article/best-books-2017-so-far.html">The Best Books of 2017 So Far</a>.&rdquo; The usual standards apply — lists are meaningless, you can&rsquo;t really rate literary works, lists provide nothing more than clickbait for media sites that are addicted to clicks at the expense of thoughtful coverage, etc. etc. etc. — but sometimes lists of this sort spur bookstore shopping excursions, and who am I to argue with the buying of (and/or library-checking-out-ing of) new books?</p></li>

<li><p>OpenCulture published a great piece about why lowering your productivity might actually lead to better work. <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2017/06/charles-darwin-charles-dickens-four-hour-work-day-the-case-for-why-less-work-can-mean-more-productivity.html">If it was good enough for Charles Dickens, it&rsquo;s good enough for you</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>The Harry Potter books are now <a href="http://blog.nathanbransford.com/2017/06/harry-potter-at-20-what-has-series.html">20 years old</a>.</p></li>
