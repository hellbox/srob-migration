        <p>It&rsquo;s true that Donald Trump has admitted to never reading books. But in case you think he doesn&rsquo;t care about books, please note that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-book-donor-money_us_580e7b09e4b02444efa4e7c4?rv5">the Huffington Post revealed</a> that Trump bought $300,000 in small donations to his campaign on books last month.
