1. Artist Trust's Grants for Artists Projects submissions process is open. Sixty Washington State artists will receive grants of $1500 for art-related projects, which they define as "materials, equipment, and artist fees needed for the development, completion, or presentation of new work; publication; travel for creative research; documentation; and workshops for professional development." [Here's a PDF](http://artisttrust.org/files/funding/2016_Artist_Trust_GAP_Guidelines_FINAL.pdf) explaining the rules. Submissions must be received by **May 23rd** of this year.

2. Hugo House is hiring a full-time marketing and communications manager because their current manager, the estimable Kristen Steenbeeke, is entering an MFA program. This is a unique opoprtunity to spread the word about the Hugo House as they enter a time of transition and rebirth. You get to promote writers, writing classes, readings, and all sorts of interesting ideas. Plus, you get to send e-mails to the *Seattle Review of Books*, which, really, is its own kind of reward.
