        <p>Sponsor Hugo House is here to let you know about two upcoming event series, both of which are tremendously awesome. First: Word Works: writers on writing. Six writers talkinga bout their process and skills, each focused on a particular part of writing. Second: Hugo Literary Series, where writers and musicians are given a theme or prompt, and debut original work based around that prompt live in front of an audience.</p>

<p>You should be in that audience â€” event tickets are remarkably cheap, and fun will be had by all. In fact, we recommend you pick up the series passes &mdash; it&rsquo;s less than dinner at some midrange Seattle restaurants, and what you save in money you&rsquo;ll make up in pleasure and inspiration. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">Find out more on our sponsor&rsquo;s page</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s thanks to sponsors like Hugo House, and readers like you, that we&rsquo;re able to keep the pixels lit up here at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>. We&rsquo;ve <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">just released our next block of sponsorship opportunities</a>.
