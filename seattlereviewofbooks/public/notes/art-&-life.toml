Art saves nothing<br>
and this is not art<br>
just words running<br>
in lines, hoping to reach<br>
redemption. Meanwhile<br>
time is running&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out

for bat and bee,<br>
hippo and elephant.<br>
Coral reefs are dying. Salmon,<br>
once wild, breed in tubs.<br>
Don't put your hope in poems

that plot the putrid doings<br>
of bankers, that bank<br>
on Franz Marc's red horses<br>
gamboling and grazing,<br>
as if we'd never learned<br>
to fabricate glue from hooves.
