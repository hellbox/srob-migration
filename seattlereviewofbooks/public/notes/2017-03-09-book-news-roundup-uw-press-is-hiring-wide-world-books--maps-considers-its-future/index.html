<li><a href="http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2952#m35724">Shelf Awareness reports</a> that Wallingford&rsquo;s Wide World Books &amp; Maps has to move next month:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>The company is considering a few options, including reopening in another location or focusing solely on its Web business. Also under consideration are the possibilities of adding a coffee shop or wine/beer bar, or services like travel consulting "if we can find a different location that is already set up for these types of activities.... A partnership to share space with an existing cafÃ© or coffee shop would also be of interest to us."</blockquote>

<li>If you&rsquo;re looking for work in the publishing field, you should note that UW Press is now looking to fill two positions:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>The UW Press has an outstanding opportunity [for a Senior Acquisitions Editor](https://uwhires.admin.washington.edu/eng/candidates/default.cfm?szCategory=jobprofile&szOrderID=142027&szCandidateID=0&szSearchWords=&szReturnToSearch=1) to acquire and transmit 20-25 high-quality trade manuscripts annually for publication for regional and national audiences. Areas for acquisitions will complement the press's existing editorial program in regional and U.S. history and culture, Asian and Asian American studies, environmental history, women's, gender, and sexuality studies, visual culture, and Native and Indigenous studies, with the opportunity to build distinguished lists in other areas. </blockquote>

<blockquote>The University of Washington Press has an outstanding temporary opportunity [for a MELLON DIVERSITY FELLOW](https://uwhires.admin.washington.edu/eng/candidates/default.cfm?szCategory=jobprofile&szOrderID=142498&szCandidateID=0&szSearchWords=&szReturnToSearch=1).... Through this temporary, full-time entry-level position, the Mellon diversity fellow will be immersed in the acquisitions department of a leading scholarly press, working closely with senior acquisitions editors, authors, and projects through the entire acquisitions process. In this experience, the fellow's main role will be to coordinate and support the work of evaluating, developing, and acquiring book-length manuscripts for publication by UW Press.</blockquote>
