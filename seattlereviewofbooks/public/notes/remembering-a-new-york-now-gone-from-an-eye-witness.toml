<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1482182403693/fay-webern.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">This week, Sagging Meniscus Press is back to show their new book from Fay Webern: _The Button Thief of East 14th Street: Stories from a Life on the Lower East Side 1927-1957_. It's an captivating work that captures New York at a vital time, seen from the inside.</p>

We have a full, long chapter on our <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">sponsorâ€™s page</a>, but we're embedding a YouTube video here, as well, of Webern reading a short chapter called "The Pretzel Lady at Union Square". We love her stories, and love hearing her tell them. 

<p>Sponsors like Sagging Meniscus make the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> possible. Did you know you could sponsor us, as well? Get your stories, or novel, or event in front of our passionate audience. We only have two dates left in our current block.
