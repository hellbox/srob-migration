        <p class="intro">Ask any writer: the two most difficult parts of the writing process are **1)** sitting down in the seat to write and **2)** figuring out what to write about. We *can't* help you focus on your work, but we *can* try to help you find inspiration in the city around you. That's what Seattle Writing Prompts is all about. These prompts are offered free to anyone who needs them; all the *Seattle Review of Books* asks in return is that you thank us in the acknowledgements when you turn it into a book.</p>

<p class="image">The opening paragraphs of [this *Seattle PI* story by Daniel DeMay](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/The-grandest-plan-for-Seattle-6399834.php) are so vivid and intriguing that they're practically the beginning of their own sci-fi novel:</p>

<blockquote>Imagine a greater Seattle area that is clearly thought out, directed and completely planned for.</blockquote> 

<blockquote> Rapid, subway transit lines connect east to west, north to south and neighborhoods across the city. An above-ground rail line links Everett to Tacoma and passes through a central station where Roy Street now intersects with Highway 99.</blockquote> 

<blockquote> Downtown buildings are capped in height, much like Paris, so as to let light into downtown streets. Mercer Island is one big park, restricted from development. And city government offices are condensed in a grand civic center across Denny Way from where Seattle Center now sits.</blockquote> 

<blockquote> All this and more was envisioned by Virgil G. Bogue, an engineer and -- some might say -- visionary who came to draft a sweeping plan for Seattle in 1911.</blockquote>

<p>Go <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/The-grandest-plan-for-Seattle-6399834.php">read the whole great story</a> to find out why we&rsquo;re not living in Bogue&rsquo;s Seattle. And then think about what would have happened if Seattle voted for Bogue&rsquo;s plan in 1912. What do you think everyday life would be like 100 years later in that Seattle? Would it be an urbanist utopia, or an antique-looking steampunk wasteland? Take a walk and try to overlay Bogue&rsquo;s vision on top of the city you see. Then write about it. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/">Let us know</a> if you come up with something interesting.</p>
