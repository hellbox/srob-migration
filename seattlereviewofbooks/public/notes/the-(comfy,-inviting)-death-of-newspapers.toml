[Design Milk published a photo-heavy tour of the Press Hotel](http://design-milk.com/boutique-hotel-portland-maine-inspired-local-newspaper/), a new boutique hotel constructed from the old *Portland Press Herald* newspaper building in Portland, Maine. It's a little too precious — my heart hurts to see perfectly good typewriters used as decoration — but on the whole it's a gorgeous, writerly space. Maybe they'll offer a writer-in-residence program? Those writing desks look particularly welcoming.
