<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>Everyone calls comics “graphic novels,” but a lot of great comics, like *Persepolis* and *Fun Home*, are non-fiction. So “novel” isn’t right. But some comics aren’t funny at all, and so “comic” books doesn’t make sense, either.</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>A couple of bookstores in town call their comics sections “graphica,” which seems really pretentious. Is there a better name for these books? Am I worrying about nothing?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Mark, Wedgwood</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>P.S. Sorry for the inanity of the question. I’m aware that the world is sitting on the precipice of Armageddon and a madman is in the White House, but I’d like to think we can walk and chew gum at the same time, metaphorically speaking.</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Mark,</p>

<p class="noindent">Life is full of irritating incongruities like the one you describe – tinfoil is really aluminum, jellyfish are angrily neither, and pro-life politicians who would defund Planned Parenthood are really smarmy fuck-weasels who despise half their constituency.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wish I was poisonous, you know?</p>

<p>But personally, I like the word &ldquo;graphica,&rdquo; which, as you point out, is more inclusive than &ldquo;graphic novel&rdquo; or &ldquo;comic book.&rdquo; It reminds me of &ldquo;novella,&rdquo; an approachable word that means, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re a very busy person but I am a creature of few words and I would love to entertain you while you are taking a shit.&rdquo; Metaphorically speaking.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>

<p class="noindent">P.S. Have you read [*The Impostor's Daughter*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316033060)? I highly recommend it. I also highly recommend hissing as a form of communication and using Dentine Ice as a martini garnish.</p>
