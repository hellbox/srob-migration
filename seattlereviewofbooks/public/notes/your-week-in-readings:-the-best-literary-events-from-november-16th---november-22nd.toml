This West Seattle-centric reading series features Imani Sims (whose poem “Allure” begins “She was perfect pitcher,/Cooled glass and ice center”) and Alma García, a writer of short stories (and, recently, a novel) who writes about the Latinx experience and what an appropriate size would be for a “dog-sized” dog. *C&P Coffee Co., 5612 California Ave. SW, http://wordswestliterary.weebly.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday November 18th: Michelle Tea, Donna Kaz, Jordan O’Jordan**</h5></p> 

As [Sarah Galvin noted in her excellent review](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/after-the-end-of-the-world/), Michelle Tea is an iconic memoirist and queer sex symbol. Her newest book, *Black Wave*, is a memoir with a dystopic novel laid over the top, which kind of resembles the world in which we live right now. Tea is joined by memoirist Donna Kaz and musician Jordan O’Jordan.

<h5>**Sunday November 20th: *Run the Red Lights* Reading**</h5></p> 

With his thoughtful, funny poems, Ed Skoog was one of the best writers in Seattle. Then he had to move away. But this city still fucking loves him to pieces.
