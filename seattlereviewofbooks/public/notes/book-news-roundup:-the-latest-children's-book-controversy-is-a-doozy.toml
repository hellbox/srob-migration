* The children's book world is in turmoil right now over [a controversial new book for kids that focuses on German suffering during World War II](http://jewcy.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/childrens-book-german-suffering-wwii). Gabriela Geselowitz at Jewcy first notes the similarity to [the kid's book from earlier this year which made light of slavery](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-idea-of-freedom-might-be-too-great-a-temptation-for-them-to-resist/), and then she writes:

<blockquote>Part of what is disturbing about the reception of the book is the unexplored idea of the motherâ€™s brief attempt to seat the slave laborers at the kitchen table as a great act of bravery and resistance, a sufficient antidote to the evil which is not even alluded to in the rest of the story.</blockquote>

* Seth Grahame Smith, the author of *Pride and Prejudice and Zombies*, is [being sued by his publisher for breach of contract](http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/seth-grahame-smith-publisher-sued-pride-prejudice/) because he reportedly turned in a remixed public-domain work and they expected an all-new work. 

* This [bomb-throwing story](http://www.theouthousers.com/index.php/features/136167-die-industry-die-or-why-letting-comics-fail-is-the-real-only-way-to-save-the-industry.html) at comics news and commentary site The Outhousers is certainly a little aggro, but it makes a good point: it's very weird that the comic book industry entirely relies on pre-orders. No other industry builds their entire business model on the idea that customers pre-order their products, sight unseen. Books can live and die before readers even get to check out the first issue. There must be a better way to run the industry, right?
