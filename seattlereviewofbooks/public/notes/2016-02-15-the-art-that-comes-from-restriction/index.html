        <p>Our thanks to <a href="http://www.saggingmeniscus.com" title="Home | Sagging Meniscus Press">Sagging Meniscus Press</a> for sponsoring the site this week with a truly unique, and remarkable, book: <em>The Too-Brief Chronicle of Judah Lowe</em>, by Christopher Carter Sanderson. On <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">our sponsors page we have three excerpts</a>: from the introduction, which sets the stage, and from each of the two sections of the book, each told through the lens of severe restriction. All art comes from the artist creating rules and restrictions &mdash; some of them mundane, such as the choice of paint or the size of canvas, some of them severe (those of you who saw the brilliant film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Obstructions"><em>The Five Obstructions</em></a> will know what we&rsquo;re talking about). Certain artists work within severe restriction, and the work, like it does here, can end up bulging at the seams. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">You really have to read this</a>.</p>

<p>Sagging Meniscus took advantage of our sponsorship program &mdash; <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">new dates are now available through the Summer</a>. If you&rsquo;re a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">take a look at our open dates</a>. We&rsquo;d love to talk to you about the possibilities.</p>
