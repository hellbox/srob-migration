<h5>Reading around: new titles on the crime fiction scene</h5>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1495686688058/Into%20the%20Water%20-%20High%20Res.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">A river with a forebodingly named spot called the Drowning Pool features as a key element in _Into the Water_ (Riverhead). Paula Hawkins’s turbulent follow-up to 2015’s unstoppable _Girl on the Train_, this psychological thriller is just as rife with twists and turns, but is set compactly in a northern English village, rather than a London suburb. The rural setting lends itself beautifully to the mysteries at hand &mdash; a suspiciously high number of people have met their end in the Drowning Pool &mdash; and Hawkins has enormous fun with a wide swathe of rotating narrators. She ventures into seriously dark psychological and societal territories here, not the least of which being the hypocrisy and violence that often lies indelibly at the heart of even the smallest of communities. </p>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1495686717269/The%20Chalk%20Pit.Griffiths.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">A cache of bones discovered in a medieval tunnel beneath the city of Norwich piques the interest and curiosity of forensic archaeologist Ruth Galloway in _The Chalk Pit_ by Elly Griffiths (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt). But things quickly take a particularly sinister turn as Galloway’s former lover and policeman colleague, DCI Nelson, begins to investigate a series of mysterious disappearances and deaths in the region: from the homeless population to yuppie communities, no one, it seems is safe. Griffiths nimbly weaves a proper police procedural with a gimlet-eyed take on finger-on-the-contemporary-pulse social issues, as well as immersing her characters in ginormous life changes. </p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1495686757257/9780385352161_final%20cover.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">The specter of nefariously used social media &mdash; Tinder, in this case &mdash; raises its ugly head in _The Thirst_ by Jo Nesbo, translated from the Norwegian by Neil Smith (Knopf). But, this being a Nesbo novel featuring the Oslo detective Harry Hole, there’s so much more here than meets the eye, particularly as Nesbo is a master at finely drawn characters: one of the most powerful elements of his thrillers lies in the ways in which his characters interact with and affect each other. Hole &mdash; who recently left the police force for the relative safety of a teaching role and is enjoying the more mundane pleasures of life, such as attending Sufjan Stevens and Sleater-Kinney concerts with his stepson &mdash; is commandeered back onto an increasingly terrifying case that encompasses vampirism, Shakespeare’s _Othello_, and crimes both grisly and grim. Excellent, as always.</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1495686775292/EXIT%20STRATEGY.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">Nick Mason is still in death-threatening thrall to crime boss Darius Cole in _Exit Strategy_ by Steve Hamilton (Putnam), and it doesn’t get more complicated than tampering with America’s Federal Witness Protection Program &mdash; especially when a baddie escapes custody with Mason’s killing on his mind. A fiery, muscular narrative that travels at relentless speed, _Exit Strategy_ is a page-turner, yes, but also a tale of loneliness at its most extreme.</p>

<h5>The Quintessential interview: Dennis Lehane</h5>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1495686786318/SinceWeFell-small.JPG)</p>

<p class="noindent">I’ve been a fan of Dennis Lehane since 1994’s _A Drink Before the War_, which introduced his fiercely compelling and complicated Boston PIs Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro. One of our finest writers, Lehane has added high-profile television credits to his name (_The Wire_, _Boardwalk Empire_) and has seen several of his novels transformed into critically acclaimed movies. _Since We Fell_ (Ecco), his new standalone and his first novel told from a woman’s point of view, is vintage Lehane: smart, taut, beautifully written, and not to be missed. </p> 

Catch the L.A.-based Lehane at [**Elliott Bay Book Company on June 5 at 7 p.m.**](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/dennis-lehane-0)
