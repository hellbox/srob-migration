Nancy Pearl at Town Hall is our [official Sunday pick](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/07/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-december-7th-to-13th/), but before you head there you should drop by Fantagraphics and say hey to Laura Knetzger, from 1-3pm. She's throwing a release party for _Bug Boys_.

_Bug Boys_ is a compendium of the comic of the same name, and it is [really marvelous](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/short-run-i-second-that/). Head down for her official release party, pick up the book and give a local hard-working comic artist some love and sales.
