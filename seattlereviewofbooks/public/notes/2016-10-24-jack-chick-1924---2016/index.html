<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/ChickPub/status/790604219376033792">Twitter feed of Chick Publications</a> is reporting that Jack Chick, the religious cartoonist famous for his pocket-sezed &ldquo;Chick tracts&rdquo;, has died. His comics were incredibly hateful — they insisted that basically anyone who is not straight, white, and Evangelical is a failure of a human being who deserves to burn in hell — but they were also hugely influential.</p>

<p>An army of artoonists, ranging from Dan Clowes to <a href="http://www.fredvanlente.com/cthulhutract/">Steve Ellis and Fred Van Lente</a>, have parodied Chick tracts. And for generations of kids from a Christian background, Chick tracts were their first exposure to comics. Lots of interviews with comics pros start with them picking up a strip by Jack Chick as a child and then moving over to Robert Crumb and Phoebe Gloeckner as soon as they&rsquo;re out on their own. I&rsquo;m not going to say anything nice about Chick as a human being or an artist — he was about as bigoted as they come — but I am going to say that, through no fault of his own, he&rsquo;s had a small role in the creation of a lot of good comics. Which just goes to show that great art can come from the worst, most hateful places.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to read more about Chick, <a href="http://danielraeburn.com/The_Imp,_by_Daniel_Raeburn_files/Imp_JTC.pdf">this comic, <em>The Imp</em> by Daniel Raeburn</a>, is by far the best resource out there.</p>

<p>And comics Twitter is going to have a lot to say about this over the next few days:</p>
