        <p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Wednesday July 27: <em>Xinjiang and the Modern Chinese State</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
To hear Donald Trump tell it, China is supposedly that weird blob on the other side of the world that keeps screwing us with trade.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Thursday July 28: Margin Shift</strong></h5></p>
Seattle’s Margin Shift poetry collective presents a night of young poets.
