The Man Booker Prize [announced their longlist this morning](http://www.themanbookerprize.com/news/man-booker-prize-announces-2015-longlist). The criteria changed last year to be open to international authors writing in English; up until last year, it was solely a prize for writers from the UK commonwealth, Ireland, and Zimbabwe. The longlist is:

Bill Clegg (US) - *Did You Ever Have a Family*           

Anne Enright (Ireland) - *The Green Road* 

Marlon James (Jamaica) - *A Brief History of Seven Killings* 

Laila Lalami (US) - *The Moor's Account* 

Tom McCarthy (UK) - *Satin Island* 

Chigozie Obioma (Nigeria) - *The Fishermen* 

Andrew Oâ€™Hagan (UK) - *The Illuminations* 

Marilynne Robinson (US) - *Lila*          

Anuradha Roy (India) - *Sleeping on Jupiter* 

Sunjeev Sahota (UK) - *The Year of the Runaways* 

Anna Smaill (New Zealand) - *The Chimes* 

Anne Tyler (US) - *A Spool of Blue Thread* 

Hanya Yanagihara (US) - *A Little Life* 

The shortlist of six authors will be announced on September 15th, and the winner will be announced on October 13th. 

Literary awards are fun, silly things. They don't make a book any better or worse, but they do generally help get books in the hands of more readers, which is always a good thing. The *Seattle Review of Books* is rooting for Laila Lalami.
