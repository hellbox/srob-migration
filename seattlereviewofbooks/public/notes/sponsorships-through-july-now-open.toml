We’ve [just released our next block of sponsorships](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/), from February-July. A week of sponsoring the site is $150, currently. You get a prominent mention on each page, and a mention in our social media the Monday your sponsorship goes up, and also on Saturday, a day before it goes down. 

Our sponsors are the best — local poets, writers, and events across all genres. Our sponsors allow us to pay poets and writers to bring you the content you see here every day. In return, they get exposure to the most passionate reading audience we’ve ever seen.

You can [sign up on our Sponsor page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/), or feel free to email _sponsorships_ at _seattlereviewofbooks.com_ if you have any questions. We’d love to talk to you about how we can get your work in front of our readers.
