<li><p>Tickets for the May 23rd Seattle appearance of <em>Arrested Development</em> and <em>Transparent</em> actor Jeffrey Tambor <a href="http://www.lectures.org/season/special_events.php?id=470">went on sale yesterday</a>. Seattle Arts and Lectures is bringing him to town to celebrate the publication of his memoir <em>Are You Somebody?</em></p></li>

<li><p>Cory Doctorow is <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/73044-london-book-fair-2017-cory-doctorow-unveils-his-latest-publishing-experiment-fair-trade-e-books.html">launching an online ebook retailer</a> codenamed Shut Up and Take My Money, which he bills as the world&rsquo;s first &ldquo;fair trade&rdquo; online store.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>As an author, being my own e-book retailer gets me a lot. It gets me money: once I take the normal 30 percent retail share off the top, and the customary 25 percent royalty from my publisher on the back-end, my royalty is effectively doubled. It gives me a simple, fair way to cut all the other parts of the value-chain in on my success: because this is a regular retail sale, my publishers get their regular share, likewise my agents. And, it gets me up-to-the-second data about who's buying my books and where.</blockquote>

<li><p>Amazon is not just threatening bookstores anymore. Turns out, <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/03/will-amazon-destroy-us-jobs-china.html">according to Naked Capitalism,</a> Amazon might be putting <strong>12 million non-book retail jobs</strong> at risk, too. Amazon&rsquo;s growth is increasing, mall retail stores are collapsing, and Amazon only needs half as many employees as brick-and-mortars.</p></li>

<li><p>This tweet is making the rounds:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kafka&#39;s diaries show the real fun side of writing. <a href="https://t.co/h7UWC7UFVR">pic.twitter.com/h7UWC7UFVR</a></p>&mdash; Matt Haig (@matthaig1) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthaig1/status/843585485507383296">March 19, 2017</a></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Regarding that tweet, to aspiring writers: for God&rsquo;s sake, <strong>don&rsquo;t suffer for your art</strong>. Just write every day, no matter how difficult it may be. You will improve and it will get easier. Writing doesn&rsquo;t have to be a Kafkaesque experience.</li>
