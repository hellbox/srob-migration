We're sponsored this week by a very unique book, by a very unique Seattle writer. Esther Altshul Helfgott kept a journal full of insight and poetry, as Alzheimer's first showed its affects in her husband Abe. Her book _Dear Alzheimer's_ is a startling, humane, and insightful look into a difficult time. 

You may know Helfgott from her long standing (25 years!) writers reading series _It's About Time_, held [every second Thursday at the Seattle Public Library's Ballard Branch](http://itsaboutimewriters.homestead.com). The list of past readers is a who's-who of Seattle poets and writers, and exactly the sort of Library we're advocating for: one that works with the community to make reading and writing more vibrant. 

Of course, sponsors like Helfgott are what allow us to report on issues like the Library, and keep reviews and updates coming your way. It's part of our [campaign to make internet advertising 100 percent less terrible](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/). Take a look at Helfgott's moving work [excerpted on our Sponsorships page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) &mdash; and judge for yourself.
