Just last week, [we told you](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/07/25/heres-what-vlad-from-third-place-books-is-most-looking-forward-to-this-fall/) that booksellers around Seattle were buzzing about Colson Whitehead's upcoming novel *Underground Railroad*. We quoted Vlad from Third Place Books, who praised "Whitehead’s unflinching exploration of the various manifestations of the economics of slavery."

Today, Oprah [added her approval](http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2016/08/02/oprahs-book-club-back-underground-railroad/87946160/) to the chorus of booksellers and librarians by adding the novel to her Oprah's Book Club label. "The September issue of *O, The Oprah Magazine* (available Aug. 9) will feature the former talk-show queen's interview with Whitehead," *USA Today* reports. 

This is great news for Colson Whitehead — a fabulous novelist who has never quite garnered the appreciation that he deserves, in part because he's such a fearless experimenter. No one of his books is like any other of his books: his debut novel *The Intuitionist* is a sci-fi thriller; *John Henry Days* is a big novel of ideas about the distinctly American myth of John Henry; *Apex Hides the Hurt* is a short, satirical novel in the style of Heller; *Zone One* is a zombie novel; *Sag Harbor* is a quiet, semiautobiographical story. Hopefully the Oprah acclaim will propel some of those other books to the top of reading piles and bestseller lists. Whitehead is the real deal — a novelist with an incredible body of work who puts art before personality — and he deserves every ounce of attention he's getting today.
