        <p>Hello Sunday Post readers! Thanks to our intern Rebecca Garcia Moreno for handling your picks of Sunday reads over the Summer. She did a great job. Back now to your regularly scheduled recommenations&hellip;.</p>

<h5><a href="http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-framed/" title="She was the PTA mom everyone knew. Who would want to harm her? - Los Angeles Times">Framed: she was the pta mom everyone knew. who would want to harm her?</a></h5>

<p>Christopher Goffard&rsquo;s absolutely bonkers, and incredible, six-part story from the LA Times, reproduced here in full, about people who do shitty things.</p>

<blockquote>
They were outside Plaza Vista School in Irvine, where she had watched her daughter go from kindergarten to fifth grade, where any minute now the girl would be getting out of class to look for her. Parents had entrusted their own kids to Peters for years; she was the school’s PTA president and the heart of its after-school program.

Now she watched as her ruin seemed to unfold before her. Watched as the cop emerged from her car holding a Ziploc bag of marijuana, 17 grams worth, plus a ceramic pot pipe, plus two smaller EZY Dose Pill Pouch baggies, one with 11 Percocet pills, another with 29 Vicodin. It was enough to send her to jail, and more than enough to destroy her name.</blockquote>

<p>Rebecca Moss is an artist that was traveling on a Hanjin ship when the company declared bankruptcy, and now she&rsquo;s stuck at sea and the boat can&rsquo;t arrange to come into port. Kevin Griffin fro the Vancouver Sun has an interview with her.</p>

<blockquote>
    Rebecca Moss is the British artist stranded on the Hanjin Geneva owned by the Hanjin shipping line that filed for receivership Wednesday. She was on board as part of the 23 Days at Sea Residency organized by Access Gallery in Vancouver.

<h5><a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/the-sandy-hook-hoax.html" title="The Sandy Hook Hoax">The Sandy Hook Hoax: Lenny Pozner used to believe in conspiracy theories. Until his son’s death became one.</a></h5>

<p>Lenny Ponzer&rsquo;s six-year-old son was murdered at Sandy Hook. Now, conspiracy theorists keep harassing him, and his family, convinced that his son not only didn&rsquo;t exist, but was a fiction made for some nebulous government conspiracy.</p>

<blockquote>
    It didn’t take much longer for Pozner to find out that many people didn’t believe his son had died or even that he had lived at all. Days after the rampage, a man walked around Newtown filming a video in which he declared that the massacre had been staged by “some sort of New World Order global elitists” intent on taking away our guns and our liberty. A week later, James Tracy, a professor at Florida Atlantic University, wrote a blog post expressing doubts about the massacre. By January, a 30-minute YouTube video, titled “The Sandy Hook Shooting — Fully Exposed,” which asked questions like “Wouldn’t frantic kids be a difficult target to hit?,” had been viewed more than 10 million times.
