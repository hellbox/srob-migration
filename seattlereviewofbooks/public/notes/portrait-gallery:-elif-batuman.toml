**Friday March 24th: *The Idiot* Reading**</p>

<p class="noindent">
*New Yorker* writer Elif Batuman has only one other book to her name: a non-fiction account of people who are obsessed with Russian novelists. But her debut novel, *The Idiot*—about a Harvard freshman in the mid-1990s who falls in with some questionable Eastern European types—is earning praise from all quarters. <br />*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*
