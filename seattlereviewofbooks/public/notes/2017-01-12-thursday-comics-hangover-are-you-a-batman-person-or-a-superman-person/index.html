        <p>I&rsquo;m a Superman guy, not a Batman guy. Batman&rsquo;s fine — I&rsquo;ve read plenty of Batman comics over the years — but ultimately Batman is about arrested development: any Batman story is basically a story of an emotionally stunted rich dude. There&rsquo;s only so much emotional wallowing you can do before you fall into parody. (I feel similarly about Trent Reznor: you can do a couple albums about the hurt in your soul, but after you make a couple critically acclaimed best-selling records, maybe you can afford a little therapy?) Will Arnett&rsquo;s portrayal of Batman from the 2014 <em>Lego Movie</em> spectacularly identified the character&rsquo;s ridiculousness, especially in this song:</p>

<p>Superman, on the other hand, is all about being an adult. I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/31/thursday-comics-hangover-the-superman-trick/">written about what makes Superman an interesting character</a>: internal conflict over complicated moral choices. Batman often can&rsquo;t withstand that kind of complexity.</p>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1484205712976/BMIAG.jpg)</p>

<p>But DC Comics recently released paperback collections of the first six or so issues of the 2016 <em>Batman</em> and <em>Superman</em> series, and I&rsquo;ll be damned if these two characters haven&rsquo;t flipped in my estimation: Batman is the more interesting, more adult character and Superman is caught in a tar pit of adolescent melodrama.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear: <em>Batman Vol 1: I Am Gotham</em> isn&rsquo;t a transcendant superhero comic. Hell, it&rsquo;s not even the best superhero comic from writer Tom King to be released in the last year (that would be King&rsquo;s amazing <em>Vision</em> series, which added layers of depth to a weird tertiary Marvel Comics character.) But it is a hell of a lot of fun, with Batman facing down a pirate, a crashing 747, and a pair of superpowered heroes who want to make Gotham City a better place.</p>

<p><em>I Am Gotham</em> deals directly with Batman&rsquo;s perennial Superman envy by introducing a team of heroes with Superman&rsquo;s power set but very little real-world experience. Most of the book consists of Batman trying to figure out if he can trust them, and whether he&rsquo;s been outclassed as hero of the city. King&rsquo;s Batman seems to be growing and changing: he&rsquo;s aware of his own flaws and he&rsquo;s actively trying to overcome them.</p>

<p>David Finch&rsquo;s art is not my favorite: everything looks a little too pinched, and heroes look a little too constipated. But here, Finch allows for more depth, introducing characters with different body types. His facial expressions could still use some work — so much grimacing! — but it&rsquo;s nice to see an established fan-favorite artist take on greater depth and range.</p>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1484205755437/SMSSM.jpg)</p>

<p>Speaking of depth and range, <em>Superman Vol 1: Son of Superman</em> delivers none. What a mess this comic is. It&rsquo;s unclear how much of this problem is due to writer Peter Tomasi and how much of it has to do with corporate edict. I can&rsquo;t even fully understand what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>

<p>So it seems that Superman is dead. But another Superman from a different timeline is seeking refuge in the dead Superman&rsquo;s timeline. This other Superman is married to Lois Lane (the one from his own timeline, not the one in the dead Superman&rsquo;s timeline) and has a child. This version of Superman is living in hiding, waiting for the dead Superman to come back to life. But eventually&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;oh, who cares? This book is just a bunch of flying and screaming and punching and angst, all signifying exactly nothing. It&rsquo;s too bad, too, because artist Doug Mahnke is one of the better Superman artists of our time: he can draw pretty much anything well: super-fights and morose graveside scenes and optimistic faces. But this story is all over the place, and not even Mahnke&rsquo;s remarkably solid art can provide a sense of consistency.</p>

<p>The one thing that <em>Son of Superman</em> does right is that it provides a great vision of Superman as a parent. His son with Lois, Jonathan, is basically a carbon copy of himself, only more reckless and more uncertain. This new character adds a new twist to the Superman formula: not only does he have to save the world, he has to raise a son while he&rsquo;s doing it. Being a parent makes Superman even more interesting. Too bad everything else about this Superman comic is so damn boring.</p>
