<li><p>Wordstock, Portland&rsquo;s annual literary festival, has <a href="http://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2016/9/8/who-s-coming-to-wordstock-literary-arts-reveals-the-2016-lineup">announced their 2016 lineup</a>, which will take place on November 5th. Highlights include Seattle authors like Maria Semple, Lindy West, and Sherman Alexie, along with national authors like Colson Whitehead, Yaa Gyasi, and Nicholson Baker.</p></li>

<li><p>I interviewed director Jeff Feuerzeig onstage at SIFF this summer about his new documentary <em>Author: The JT LeRoy Story</em>. One of the questions I asked had to do with the many phone calls in the documentary: Laura Albert, who pretended to be an author named JT LeRoy for years, recorded all her phone calls, seemingly without the other callers&rsquo; permission. Many of those recordings are in the film. I didn&rsquo;t record the onstage interview so I don&rsquo;t have Feuerzeig&rsquo;s response handy, but he stood by his film and his treatment of the recordings. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/12/movies/asia-argento-and-others-are-angry-about-being-in-jt-leroy-documentary.html?smid=nytcore-ipad-share&amp;smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;_r=0">This <em>New York Times</em> story</a> indicates that others are unhappy with the very existence of the tapes:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>For some people who reviewed transcripts from “Author” provided by *The New York Times*, the revelation years after the fact that Ms. Albert had been covertly recording phone calls was yet another deception in a trail of mendacity that extended to the late 1990s and early 2000s, when JT LeRoy published “Sarah,” a novel about a 12-year-old truck-stop prostitute, and “The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things,” linked short stories about an abused boy.</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I was not especially impressed with <em>Author</em>. I thought it was one-sided to the point of almost being a hagiography of Albert. Feuerzeig defended his movie in the interview, referring to it as New Journalism in the style of Tom Wolfe.</p></li>

<li><p>Spokane author Kate Lebo <a href="http://therumpus.net/2016/09/the-saturday-rumpus-essay-twenty-three-pieces-of-the-sunset-bowl/">published a wonderful essay about gentrification in Seattle</a> on The Rumpus over the weekend. It&rsquo;s titled &ldquo;Twenty-Three Pieces of the Sunset Bowl&rdquo; and you should read it. We <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/exit-interview-talking-with-kate-lebo-about-why-she-left-seattle-for-spokane/">ran an interview with Lebo on Seattle&rsquo;s many changes</a> last year.</p></li>
