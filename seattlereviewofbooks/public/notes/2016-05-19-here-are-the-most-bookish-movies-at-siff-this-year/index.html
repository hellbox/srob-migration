<p class="intro">The Seattle International Film Festival kicks off tonight, and the next four weeks will bring hundreds of movies from around the world to venues throughout the region. You should absolutely take part in SIFF; it’s one of the cultural events that shapes and defines the city. Because we know you love books — you’re on this site, after all — we thought we’d assemble SIFF’s most literary films into an alphabetical list for you, along with SIFF’s descriptions. If you’re interested in a film, just click on the title, which will take you to SIFF’s page, where you can watch a trailer and buy tickets. At the end of the list, I’ll give some of my picks.</p>

<p><strong>Whew!</strong> That’s a lot of movies. How do you narrow them down?  Here are the three I’m most excited for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I can’t wait to see <em>Author: The JT LeRoy Story</em>. LeRoy/Laura Albert is one of the most fascinating figures of the early 2000s, and the question of authenticity in literature is very serious and very interesting. (“LeRoy”’s books were billed as fiction, after all, which means there’s a slight moral difference from, say, the James Frey situation.) I’ll be interviewing director Jeff Feuerzeig after the screening at Shoreline Community College  on Monday, May 30th at 3 pm.</p></li>

<li><p>Whit Stillman and Jane Austen are a match made in heaven; you could argue that Stillman’s movies have largely been modern-day Austen riffs. So <em>Love &amp; Friendship</em> is a must-see: it’s got a great cast, Stillman is stretching himself in an interesting way, and even a bad Austen adaptation has the benefit of being an Austen adaptation, so you can’t really go wrong with this one.</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="http://www.traileraddict.com/slash-2016/trailer">trailer for <em>Slash</em> sold me</a>. A teen comedy set in the world of sexy fan fiction? With what seems to be a realistic depiction of nerd culture? I’m down for any movie about finding your identity through writing, and movies that demonstrate both the benefits and the detriments of growing up nerdy are in short supply.</p></li>
</ul>
