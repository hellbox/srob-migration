        <p>Very sad news: we&rsquo;ve received word from her literary executor that Madeline DeFrees, a Seattle poet, passed away last night. She would have been 96 years old next week.</p>

<p>DeFrees was widely celebrated, including a Guggenheim Fellowship in Poetry and two Washington State Book Awards. Her most recent collections were published with Copper Canyon Press. According to <a href="http://www.madelinedefrees.com/about-the-author/">her website</a>, DeFrees &ldquo;spent 38 years as a nun with the Catholic Congregation of Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary.  She entered the community after high school and later requested release because, in her words, &lsquo;religious life and poetry both demand an absolute commitment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1447397981594/bluedusk-274x411.jpg" alt="" /></p>We hope to talk with some friends of DeFrees in the coming days. She had a remarkable talent; her poems were alive with a baroque imagery that most modern poets simply cannot touch. Consider &ldquo;<a href="http://www.madelinedefrees.com/a-woman-possessed/">A Woman Possessed</a>,&rdquo; with its ferocious bullfighting imagery, or her later poem &ldquo;<a href="http://www.madelinedefrees.com/still-life/">Still Life</a>,&rdquo; which begins with these bracing lines: &ldquo;After your letter arrived I left the oven on/all night and never once/put my head in it.&rdquo; (That whole poem is a breathtaking razor&rsquo;s edge of a thing, a highwire act in the middle of an earthquake.) &ldquo;<a href="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/family-group">The Family Group</a>&rdquo; is a lamentation for a life unlived but also a clear-eyed survey of what might have been. The poet, at the zoo, sees &ldquo;the child I/never had&rdquo; and is overcome with a moment of longing: &ldquo;I wanted to take his hand/hallucinate a husband.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s an uneasy poem, documenting an uneasy moment.</p>

<p>DeFrees&rsquo;s work demonstrates an unflinching honesty that could make many self-styled confesssional poets blush, but it never feels clumsy or leering or unwelcome. Her charge as a poet, it seems, was to capture the workings of her mind, with all its contradictions and inconsistencies, and relate it in beautiful, entrancing language. DeFrees was absolutely right; poetry demands &ldquo;an absolute commitment,&rdquo; and she gave nothing less.</p>
