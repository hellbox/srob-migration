Imagine a world in which booksellers can break into your home and steal back books that you bought from them. That, basically, is a reality with e-books. [Chris Meadows wrote for TeleRead](http://www.teleread.com/barnes-noble-stole-first-e-book-ever-bought/) an account of how Barnes & Noble "stole" the first e-book he ever bought. He even contacted Barnes & Noble to complain, and they told him he could re-buy the e-book from them if he wanted. A couple days later, Barnes & Noble [did decide to give Meadows back the e-book](http://www.teleread.com/barnes-noble-gives-first-e-book-back/) that he purchased.  Awfully gracious of them.

Remember: **you do not own the e-books that you buy** from online retailers like Barnes & Noble and Amazon. You license them, and there's nothing you can do if the publisher decides to take the book back from your online library.
