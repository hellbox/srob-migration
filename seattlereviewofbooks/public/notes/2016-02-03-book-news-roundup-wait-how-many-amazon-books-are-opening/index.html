      <div class="content">
        <ul>
<li><p>After <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/02/amazon-to-open-hundreds-of-bookstores-nationwide/">yesterday&rsquo;s gossip</a> that Amazon is considering opening hundreds of Amazon Books locations nationwide in the next few years, Shelf Awareness, the industry news site which first broke the Amazon Books story, <a href="http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2682">now says Amazon&rsquo;s plans are more modest</a>, likely in the range of a dozen or so stores. We at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> have heard that, too, from people in the industry. Amazon, of course, could do away with these rumors immediately, but Amazon doesn&rsquo;t comment on stories like these. Amazon never has any comment.</p></li>

<li><p>We heard some gossip last night that a long-running and much-beloved local reading series might be ending for good this year. We hope the rumors aren&rsquo;t true, but we&rsquo;re on the story and will let you know as soon as we hear something solid.</p></li>

<li><p>If you are a woman who makes comics, you should apply for Trailer Blaze, the Short Run festival&rsquo;s Ladies Comics Residency. If you&rsquo;re selected, you&rsquo;ll take up residence at the Souâ€™Wester vintage RV park and lodge in Seaview, WA from April 10th through the 15th. <a href="http://shortrunseattle.tumblr.com/">Applications are due by February 19th</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of Short Run news, here&rsquo;s the announcement for this year&rsquo;s festival dates:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">SAVE THE DATE: NOVEMBER 5, 2016 The 6th Annual Short Run Comix &amp; Arts Festival at Fisher Pavilion, Seattle Center.</p>&mdash; Short Run (@shortrunseattle) <a href="https://twitter.com/shortrunseattle/status/694762055664971776">February 3, 2016</a></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>If I may editorialize in this news roundup for a moment, I&rsquo;m glad Short Run is returning to Fisher Pavillion; it gave the festival a convention-like feel. If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the show, my Short Run 2016 <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/short-run-for-the-long-haul/">wrap-up is here</a>, and <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/short-run-i-second-that/">Martin McClellan&rsquo;s is here</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Congratulations to the University of Washington Press, which just <a href="http://uwpressblog.com/2016/01/14/mellon-grant-to-create-university-press-diversity-fellowship-program/?utm_source=February+2016&amp;utm_campaign=February+2016+Enews&amp;utm_medium=email">landed a grant that will do some good</a> in the publishing industry:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>A four-year, $682,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded to the University of Washington will help four university presses and the Association of American University Presses (AAUP) create a pipeline program to diversify academic publishing by offering apprenticeships in acquisitions departments.</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Believe me, if you had the access to publisher catalogs that I have, you&rsquo;d be <strong>blinded by all the whiteness</strong> of the authors. University press catalogs are often the worst offenders. This is a big get for UW Press, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see the new titles that come out of it. It will also likely launch a few careers in the publishing industry, too, and the publishing industry <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/27/book-news-roundup-the-diversity-in-publishing-edition/">desperately needs some diversity</a>.</li>
