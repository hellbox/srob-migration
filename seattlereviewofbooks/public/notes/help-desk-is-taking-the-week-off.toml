After writing what was [arguably the single best Help Desk of all time last week](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/05/05/the-help-desk-name-one-good-thing-and-one-bad-thing-about-seattle/), Cienna Madrid is taking the week off. As always, you can [read and enjoy all of her Help Desk columns](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-help-desk/) in our archives, and if you have any questions or comments for Cienna, you can reach her at advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com. 

Those who believe Cienna Madrid should run for mayor of Seattle are encouraged to contact her at the same address.
