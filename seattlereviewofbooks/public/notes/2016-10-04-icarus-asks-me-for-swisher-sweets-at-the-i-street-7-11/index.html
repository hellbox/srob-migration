        <p>I did not see her in flight or morning.<br>
I did not stand her harps or trumpets.<br>
or anything in my getting up day.<br>
I traded the dreams we made on the ground<br>
for my dream to be a god in the sky<br>
(It was a guilded Gethsemane).<br>
Hell is immortality without a net.<br>
Immortality is a moon that never sets<br>
after a million Sunday suns.</p>

<p>What was more important in the clouds<br>
to my zest for joy unseen?<br>
What unseen lord lineated my wings<br>
and made them more important than our broom?<br>
What made them more important than our leaps<br>
Through earth bound walls and beams?<br>
What &mdash; in the light &mdash; was far more desirable<br>
than the beads of sweat in our dreams?</p>

<p>Once we salved our scars on the ground.<br>
Fields bent around the space we tided<br>
and stole away from lashes and bounders.<br>
Once we stilled the weevil in stole away hours<br>
and made nothing more important than our clay.<br>
Once we spun and made a world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then I flew away.</p>

<p>Why, boy, why should she have not kept moving?<br>
My funeral band should have been dusted.<br>
My procession was better off bare and emptied<br>
in a taxonomy of heartbreak and loss;<br>
a mournersâ€™ row of upturned plots<br>
for living graves of swords and shields.<br>
Hope brought her no feathers in ruby red fields<br>
and memory gave her no balms.<br>
Why should she mourn me in the memory of flight<br>
when my rails meant more than her arms?</p>
