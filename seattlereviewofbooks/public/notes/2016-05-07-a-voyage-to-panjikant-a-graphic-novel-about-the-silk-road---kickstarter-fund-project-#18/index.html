<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_A Voyage to Panjikant: A graphic novel about the Silk Road_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/703932989/a-voyage-to-panjikant-a-graphic-novel-about-the-si?ref=category_recommended). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Marguerite Dabaie](http://mdabaie.com).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>An ambitious teenage girl of the ancient past rallies against the closed-minded world she must abide by--but at a great cost.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
I love historical projects, and here's one that has included a lot of research into the groups of people who were being written about. That, and the silk road has always had a tremendous interest for me. The paths of trade inform so much of the shape of our world, and have for thousands of years. How interesting to take a look back into time, and a graphic novel is a great medium for that.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Looks like a good story, first of all, but beyond that, back it to learn something of the Sogdian people, an ancient civilization of what is now Iran. Tons of trade happened between Tang Dynasty China and Sogdian merchants. This book takes a look inside one fictional family and how they lived. 
</p>

<p>Dabaie has a series of great reward options, but of course, the goal here is to get the book. Everything else is gravy.</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">She's made 118% of goal of $4330 at this point, so hurray! </p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
