<p>I just bought it last night, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that <em>Atlas #1</em> is the ugliest comic book I own. Only the cover, a sensitive piece by Anders Nilson featuring the titular hero holding a charred corpse while floating in a smoggy yellow haze, is aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p>But flip past the cover, and the rest of this book is ugly as sin: the coloring is garish and sloppy, the art style is childlike and aggressive, and the writing is opportunistic and so drenched in irony that it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if it&rsquo;s a joke, or a joke about a joke, or if it&rsquo;s supposed to be taken entirely straight. But the worst part of this ugly book is that it&rsquo;s published by a press that makes some of the world&rsquo;s most beautiful books — Seattle&rsquo;s own Fantagraphics Books.</p>

<p><em>Atlas</em> is part of Fantagraphics&rsquo; All Time Comics initiative, a nostalgia line intended to evoke the Marvel and DC Comics of the mid-1980s. All Time has even hired many of the creators from that time and put them back to work drawing books. Even the &ldquo;ads&rdquo; for Atari 2600-style video games on the back cover look like they were originally published in the 80s.</p>

<p>But the book is positively dripping with contempt. Is it contempt for the audience? For the mainstream comics that inspired the All Time line? For the superhero-infested popular culture around all of us at all times? Unclear. The contempt seems to fly in all directions. Nobody is clean.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no point trying to explain the plot of <em>Atlas</em>. A superhero strikes a congressman in public and is then sent to jail. Meanwhile Atlas&rsquo;s friends are being burned alive. Somebody has to pay. <em>Atlas</em> pretends to be the center chapter in a long, ongoing superhero story, with an imaginary continuity stretching back decades.</p>

<p>But the truth is, none of that matters. The only noteworthy thing about <em>Atlas</em> #1 is how ugly it is — how offensive it is to the eye. Everyone&rsquo;s anatomy is misshapen. Panels frame grimacing close-ups and the dialogue strains against itself on every page:</p>

<blockquote>Tobey! No!! You stupid kid!! What have you done?! I can't protect you in this godforsaken place! I can't even help myself right now! Tobey could DIE here! ANYTHING could happen. He doesn't know WHAT kinds of MONSTERS we're locked up with!</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s all like that: clunky and hammy and willfully dumb. I can&rsquo;t imagine the circumstances that would allow someone to enjoy this kind of thing. Sometimes Fantagraphics&rsquo; reach exceeds its grasp, but this is the first out-and-out failure I&rsquo;ve seen from them in over a decade.</p>
