        <h5><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-amazon-echo/" title="The Real Story of How Amazon Built the Echo">The Real Story of How Amazon Built the Echo</a></h5>

<p>A long piece by Joshua Brustein in Bloomberg about how the Echo came to be, and how it came to be a hit, despite pundits prognosticating sure failure.</p>

<blockquote>
    When it launched, Amazon’s critics jumped to mock the company. Some called it a useless gimmick; others pointed to it as evidence of Amazon’s Orwellian tendencies. Then something weird happened: People decided they loved it. Amazon never releases data about how its products are selling, but Consumer Intelligence Research Partners issued a report this month saying that Amazon had sold more than 3 million devices, with 1 million of those sales happening during the 2015 holiday season. About 35,000 people have reviewed the speaker on Amazon.com, with an average rating of 4.5 stars out of 5.

<p>Thank you Dan Piepenbring, for bringing us the serious issues of yesterday.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Virginia Postrel takes us inside how modern designers are using computers and 3-D printing to change fashion.</p>

<blockquote>
    For designers willing to work closely with technologists, however, digitally driven production techniques are enabling new aesthetic and functional forms. Unlike wearables, which incorporate computing into garments and accessories, here the fashion, not the technology, is the focus.
