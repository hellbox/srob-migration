This year's Philip K. Dick Awards shortlist [was released last week](http://www.philipkdickaward.org/):

<blockquote><p>EDGE OF DARK by Brenda Cooper (Pyr)</p>
<p>AFTER THE SAUCERS LANDED by Douglas Lain (Night Shade Books)</p>
<p>(R)EVOLUTION by PJ Manney (47North)</p>
<p>APEX by Ramez Naam (Angry Robot Books)</p>
<p>WINDSWEPT by Adam Rakunas (Angry Robot Books)</p>
<p>ARCHANGEL by Marguerite Reed (Arche Press)</p></blockquote>

On that list, Brenda Cooper lives in Kirkland, Ramez Naam is a Seattle author, and Adam Rakunas moved to Seattle last year. ([Read my review of *Windswept* here](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/state-of-the-union/).) This is a pretty strong showing for local sci-fi. It's especially heartening that it's the Dick Awards, too, because they are, in my opinion, the best of the science fiction awards, favoring substance over style. 

The winner of the Philip K. Dick Award will be announced at Norwescon in SeaTac on Friday, March 25th. Here's hoping a local author brings it home.
