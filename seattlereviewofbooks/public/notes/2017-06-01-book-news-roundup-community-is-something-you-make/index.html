<li>Fantagraphics Books is publishing a new comics anthology, titled <em>Now</em>. And Fantagraphics associate publisher Eric Reynolds <a href="http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/cr_sunday_interview_bundled_extra_editor_eric_reynolds_of_fantagraphics_on/">explained to the <em>Comics Reporter</em>&rsquo;s Tom Spurgeon</a> that the idea for <em>Now</em> came straight out of Seattle:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>The idea really coalesced after last year's Short Run festival. I went to that show with a plan to really canvas the show and see what was there. I don't get to actually shop extensively at shows very often, and I ended up dropping close to a couple of hundred bucks, buying anything that looked even remotely interesting. There was a lot of good work that I felt was probably being overlooked because of either the signal to noise ratio or even just the harsh realities of distribution. If you don't live in a region that has a show like Short Run, you're likely to never be exposed to a lot the work that's there. And I came away from that show realizing that Fantagraphics can provide a platform to get the work out there.</blockquote>

<li><p>Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor&rsquo;s talk at Town Hall last night was canceled, <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/princeton-professor-cancels-town-hall-seattle-talk-following-deluge-of-racist-threats/">Sara Bernard reported at the <em>Seattle Weekly</em></a>. Taylor had received death threats since publicly criticizing Donald Trump at a commencement address. Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, how <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/26/us/ann-coulter-berkeley-speech-canceled/">one canceled Ann Coulter appearance</a> can inspire the mainstream media to talk endlessly about the snowflakes of the left, but Taylor&rsquo;s experience barely makes a dent in the popular consciousness? Anyway, maybe you should read Taylor&rsquo;s new book, <em>From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation</em>.</p></li>

Portland poets are hosting a number of benefit readings for Fletcher, including one with an appearance by Seattle-area poet Robert Lashley.</p></li>

<li><p>HBO has <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2017/06/julia-roberts-series-today-will-be-different-hbo.html">picked up the Julia Roberts-starring adaptation</a> of Seattle writer Maria Semple&rsquo;s novel <em>Today Will Be Different</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="http://bookriot.com/2017/05/30/library-late-fines-are-not-helping-anyone/">case against library late fees</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Only eight percent of all literary magazines <a href="http://www.themillions.com/2017/05/why-literary-journals-dont-pay.html">actually pay their contributors</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of depressing financial realities: want to make comics for a living? Better <a href="http://www.comicsbeat.com/graphic-novelist-quits-making-graphic-novels-after-trying-to-live-on-10kyear-for-three-years/">marry someone who&rsquo;s got a steady, good-paying job</a>!</p></li>
