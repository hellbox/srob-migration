Sponsor Ronna Wineberg generously gave us permission to run an entire short story from her book _Nine Facts That Can Change Your Life_ for her sponsorship this week. The story, "Bare Essentials", [appears in full on our sponsor's page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships).

The book received great marks in _Kirkus_ and the _Village Voice_, but it's what you think that matters most, which is why a full story is such a treat. Be sure to indulge yourself, and if you like it, click through to pick up the book.

Sponsors like Ronna Wineberg make the _Seattle Review of Books_ possible. Did you know you could sponsor us, as well? Get your stories, or novel, or event in front of our passionate audience. There are some dates open perfect for pitching your product for the holidays. Take a glance at [our sponsorship information page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/) for dates and details.
