<p>Something very strange happens when you get a bunch of book people — booksellers and librarians, say — to sit down at a bar with a bunch of people who work with movies, like projectionists and film bookers. Usually, all the book people want to talk about is movies: what’s coming out, what this movie star was like when she visited town for a special screening, what working at a movie theater is like. But the movie people are excited to talk about books with a knowledgeable peer group for a change. In the end, they kind of tragically talk over and around each other in an unfortunate overlap of interests.</p>

<p>Book folks and movie folks do have a lot in common, though: they both spend a lot of time indoors, staring at things. They both adore well-told stories. They are patient and abiding lovers of fandom. And for a few weeks at the end of every Seattle spring, the interests of book and film communities intermingle during the Seattle International Film Festival.</p>

<p>Every year, a good portion of SIFF’s 400 films boast a literary pedigree, ranging from adaptations to biopics about authors to documentaries about literary figures.  <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/05/03/a-preview-of-the-seattle-international-film-festivals-most-bookish-offerings/">I wrote about some of those movies in our SIFF preview</a>, and we’ll be covering more in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The first book-to-film adaptation to debut at SIFF this year is the documentary <em>The Fabulous Allan Carr</em>, which <a href="https://www.siff.net/festival/fabulous-allan-carr-the">screens this Friday and Saturday at the Egyptian</a>. Appropriately, it’s a movie about a nerd who becomes entranced by the glitz and glamor of Hollywood.</p>

<p>With his weirdly boyish face and his unashamed enthusiasm, Hollywood producer Allan Carr gives off a sense that he’s an oversized toddler. His interview segments in the film — all recorded decades ago — are kind of bonkers. At one point, Carr enthuses: &ldquo;I love stars. Stars are my favorite thing in the world.&rdquo; We discover in the film that Carr was born Allan Solomon, and he chose the name “Carr” in part because it rhymes with “star.”</p>

<p>Carr’s enthusiasm soaked through all the projects he chose to produce. His greatest success was the John Travolta film <em>Grease</em>, but he also shepherded Ann-Margret’s career, and he was an early backer of the Village People. Everything he touched oozed of showbiz: eager to please, over-the-top, and thrumming with gay subtext.</p>

<p>Told in archival clips, brief animated segments, and sparkle-enhanced photographs that shimmer like animated gifs, <em>The Fabulous Allan Carr</em> is as eager to please and as flashy as its subject. But beneath the glitz, there’s a rock-solid structure and dense reporting — all carryovers from the book that inspired the move, Robert Hofler’s Carr biography <em>Party Animals: A Hollywood Tale of Sex, Drugs, and Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll Starring the Fabulous Allan Carr</em>. Without the substance and heft of a biography to shape the film, it might have been all style and no substance.</p>
