_Selene and Endymion_<br>
Snooze-button darling,<br>
I’ve been up all night:<br>
scrubbing the pans till they star-shine,<br>
making the mirror a gleaming lake.<br>
When I come to you<br>
you don’t wake.

_Atalanta and Hippomenes_<br>
I have a meat-eater’s heart,<br>
and baby, you’re the whole buffet.<br>
You’re ribs slick with smearing sauce,<br>
midnight ice cream<br>
too tempting not to eat &mdash;<br>
you sugared cheat.<br>
You thump between my teeth.

_Eos and Tithonus_<br>
What hurts most is your thick<br>
summer song, buzzing dew into dust,<br>
lifting its fingerprints from the leaf-blades.<br>
No. What hurts the most is<br>
that the song isn’t for me.<br>
No &mdash; what hurts most<br>
is the wasted wish of you,<br>
how I can’t remember you supple,<br>
fresh, under my tongue.
