<li><p>Seattle ice creamery Full Tilt debuts a Nancy Pearl-themed ice cream on April 10th, <a href="http://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2016/3/11/full-tilt-gives-librarian-nancy-pearl-her-own-ice-cream-flavor">reports <em>Seattle Metropolitan</em></a>. What does Nancy Pearl ice cream taste like? It&rsquo;s peanut butter with a fudge swirl.</p></li>

<li><p>Harper Lee&rsquo;s estate has reportedly killed the mass-market edition of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>. This is going to make the book inaccessible for public schools around the country. What&rsquo;s this mean? Alex Shephard at the <em>New Republic</em> writes:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Why does this matter? Mass-market books are significantly cheaper than their trade paperback counterparts. Hachette’s mass-market paperback of *TKAM* retails for $8.99, while the trade paperbacks published by Hachette’s rival HarperCollins go for $14.99 and $16.99.</blockquote>

<li><p>On Friday, <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/why-publishing-industry-isnt-peril/">On the Media ran an excellent podcast about the publishing industry</a>, featuring interviews with experts about Amazon Books, e-book sales, and other topics. If you&rsquo;re looking for proof that the publishing industry&rsquo;s death has been greatly exaggerated, this podcast is a great place to start.</p></li>

<li><p>And while we&rsquo;re talking about podcasts, <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-giftschrank/">99% Invisible&rsquo;s most recent episode</a> explains the culture that has built up around <em>Mein Kampf</em> in post-war Germany. German libraries have a system for dealing with books about sensitive topics. They store the books in what&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;Giftschrank.&rdquo;</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>The word, a combination of “poison” and “cabinet,” has a variety of meanings in different contexts. At its most literal, a Giftschrank is a space for storing controlled substances in places like pharmacies. Colloquially, it can refer to spaces reserved for all kinds of hidden and forbidden objects, ideas or stories.</blockquote>
