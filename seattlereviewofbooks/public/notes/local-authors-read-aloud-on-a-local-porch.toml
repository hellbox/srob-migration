Porchlit is [a nifty ongoing site-specific project](http://porchlit.org/) happening in the International District â€” specifically, the porch of a house at 500 12th Avenue S. "We upload recordings of literature - poetry, prose, monologue and so on - spoken every day on a porch for an entire year," project founders Yonnas Getahun, Campbell Thibo, and Omar Willey [write on the About page](http://porchlit.org/about). Here's amazing artist [Seb Barnett](http://brushandpen.net/) reading a very appopriate poem by Jeremy Gaulke:

We'll have more to say about Porchlit soon, but for right now go [check out the site](http://porchlit.org/) and prepare yourself for September, which is Seattle Authors & Writers Month, a celebration of local writing on maybe the unlikeliest local venue of the all.
