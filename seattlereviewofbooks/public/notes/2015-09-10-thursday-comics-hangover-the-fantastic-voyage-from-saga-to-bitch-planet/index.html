        <p class="intro">Every comics fan knows Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country. Thursday Comics Hangover is a weekly column reviewing some of the new books that I pick up at [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/), my friendly neighborhood comic book store.</p>

<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1441870657565/BitchPlanet_05-1_263_405.png" alt="" /></p>The new collected volume of <em>Saga</em>, volume five, hit the stands yesterday. I haven&rsquo;t read it yet, but I&rsquo;ve already said on multiple occasions that <em>Saga</em> is the best mainstream ongoing comic in the business today, and I don&rsquo;t think volume 5 is going to damage my opinion. (The weird thing about reading collected volumes of monthly comics is that you&rsquo;re likely to hear well in advance if an upcoming volume is going to be especially disappointing.) Phoenix Comics keeps upping their orders of <em>Saga</em>, in both the monthly and the collected editions. They got almost a hundred copies of volume 5 yesterday, and they&rsquo;ve already sold a significant portion of their order. The book keeps picking up more and more fans with each passing month; it&rsquo;s deep into &ldquo;phenomenon&rdquo; territory now.</p>

<p>The comics industry is always wringing its collective hands, trying to figure out how to get more people to read comics. We&rsquo;re at a point where many of the top ten most successful movies of any given year are superhero films, but Marvel and DC can&rsquo;t seem to turn those movie superhero fans into comic book fans. The <em>Walking Dead</em> comics series sells well, but most comics store employees say that <em>Walking Dead</em> fans tend to stick with the <em>Walking Dead</em> comics. They don&rsquo;t venture into other titles.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the case, I&rsquo;ve been told, with <em>Saga</em>. Turns out, <em>Saga</em> readers also read <em>Sex Criminals</em> and <em>Wicked and the Divine</em>. They branch out and try new comics. Why is that? Damned if I know. Maybe part of it is because <em>Saga</em> is such an expansive comic; it feels like a story that&rsquo;s always opening up to embrace new possibilities, which perhaps encourages readers, in turn, to embrace their own new possibilities. Or maybe that&rsquo;s some mystical hoo-ha BS and there&rsquo;s no good explanation.</p>

<p>In any case, yesterday also saw the release of the fifth issue of Kelly Sue DeConnick and Valentine De Landro&rsquo;s <em>Bitch Planet</em>, and, goddamnit, <em>Saga</em> fans had better be picking this series up. <em>Bitch Planet</em> takes a simple premise — a women&rsquo;s prison in space — and simultaneously embraces and refutes all the expectations that come along with the premise. Part of the pleasure of <em>Bitch Planet</em> is that it wallows in about nine pulp traditions at once: it&rsquo;s a crime comic and a prison comic and a sci-fi comic and a woman-on-the-edge comic and more, all blended into one dreamy package. Hell, this issue is a <em>sports comic</em> and I still liked it — speaking as the most sports-phobic person in the world, that&rsquo;s really saying something. And this issue has got a great guest essay by Lindy West in the back. What&rsquo;s not to love? The first collected edition of <em>Bitch Planet</em> arrives in early October; when that happens, you have no excuse for missing out.</p>
