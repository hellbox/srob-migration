<p class="noindent">Time is running out to apply to Mineral School for their 2017 residencies. Especially of interest to parents is a new series funded by the <a href="http://www.sustainableartsfoundation.org"> Sustainable Arts Foundation</a>. Thanks to that support, they're offering funded weeks at Mineral School, including room, board, visiting author readings, and tons of privacy and workspace to get the ideas in your head out into the world. </p>

[Find out more, and read a story of a Mineral School alumni, on our sponsors page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships). 

But of course, Mineral School has many more residencies available, and [you should really go take a look at all of the options](https://mineralschool.submittable.com/submit). Don't miss your chance to spend time in one of the most unique writing retreats in the Pacific Northwest. 

Mineral School, and sponsors like them, pay for all the content you see on this website. Thanks to them we can pay poets, writers, and artists to help us make the _Seattle Review of Books_ the best it can be. Did you know you can be a sponsor too? [Find out more on our sponosrship page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/), and please consider letting our readers know about your work.
