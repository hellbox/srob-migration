The wonderful [Entre Ríos Books](http://entreriosbooks.com) is back as a sponsor, with their stunning book _Twelve Saints_. The work combines poems about twelve saints with collages built from tintype photographs. The effect is somehow both ethereal and concrete, and aesthetically it is absolutely gorgeous. We have a sample spread on our [sponsor's page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships). The book is reasonably priced, for such a beautiful work, and available at many locations in town, as well as on the Entre Ríos website.

Entre Ríos took advantage of our sponsorship program &mdash; [new dates are now available through the Summer](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/). If you're a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, [take a look at our open dates](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/). Don't wait too long &mdash; we sold our last six month block out!
