<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Lance Wyman: The Visual Diaries 1973—1982_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1993782747/lance-wyman-the-visual-diaries-19731982?ref=category_recommended). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Unit Editions](http://uniteditions.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
Every day Lance Wyman documents his creative process in his black “designlogs”. Help us publish Lance Wyman: The Visual Diaries.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    If you're a design nerd, you can picture the [1968 Mexico City Olympics logo](http://graphicambient.com/2012/07/26/1968-mexico-olympics-mexico/) without much mental effort. 
    That's a good graphical identity system, when you can evoke it 48 years later without much effort. It's infamous, now, and [referenced in popular culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_(album) occasionally. Not many people can make work this iconic and memorable, but Lance Wyman, who designed the logo, sure did.
</p>

<p>
    Wyman kept a continuous series of sketchbooks &mdash; his "designlogs" &mdash; and now, for the first time, they're being collected, edited, and presented in a handsome edition. 
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Well, if you're not already clicking over to back it, then there's probably not an argument I could make to convince you. You're either a design nerd or you're not. If you are excited? Did you know that Lance Wyman is coming to Seattle to speak at [Typecon](http://www.typecon.com)? Here's a chance to see the man in person talk about his craft.
    </p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    at 71%, with 26 days left, I think they'll be fine without you, so don't feel obligated. Get it because you can't resist.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
