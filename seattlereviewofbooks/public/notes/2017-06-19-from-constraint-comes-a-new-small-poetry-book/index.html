<p class="noindent">Sponsor [Sagging Meniscus](https://saggingmeniscus.tumblr.com/post/157711883631/announcing-sagging-shorts) wants to make sure you've got this Thursday on your calendar: Seattle writer and poet Doug Nufer will be reading from his new book _The Me Theme_ at Gallery 1412. More details, and a link to the event, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">on our sponsor's page</a>. </p> 

<p>You&rsquo;ve seen Doug&rsquo;s name plenty of times on the site. He&rsquo;s a formal constraint-based writer, making some of the most interesting, and compelling, and challenging (in the best possible way) work. Take advantage of the opportunity to hear him read, accompanied by pianist Gust Burns.</p>
