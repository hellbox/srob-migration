KUOW reporter Marcie Sillman [filed a piece this morning](http://kuow.org/post/we-love-digital-world-theres-nothing-old-fashioned-book) about a new book conservation program at the University of Washington:

<blockquote>More than 10,000 items flow through the center every year; everything from fragile maps that need protective casings to books with torn bindings. Most of the binding work is outsourced to commercial binderies, but in-house conservators tend to the rare books, pamphlets and other delicate materials.</blockquote>

If you've ever wondered about the preservation of books, this is very much worth your time. Full disclosure: Sillman quotes me in the piece, but despite my involvement it's very much worth your while.
