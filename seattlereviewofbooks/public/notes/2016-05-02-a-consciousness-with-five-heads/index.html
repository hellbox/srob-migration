        <p>Sponsor Steve Toutonghi&rsquo;s debut Science Fiction Novel <em>Join</em> was just released, and you owe it to yourself to check out the <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">first chapter on our sponsorship page</a>.</p>

<p><em>Join</em> is a mind-expanding story set in a world where multiple people can join into a single consciousness. The tale is rich, tense, and nuanced, and full of the mind-expanding ideas only possible in a good science fiction story. We&rsquo;re so grateful to Steve for his sponsorship, and urge you to take a look. The worst thing that can happen is that you discover a new book you want to read. Not such a bad deal, eh?</p>

<p>We have only <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">four sponsor slots left</a>, before August. If you&rsquo;re a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">take a look at our open dates</a>. We&rsquo;d love to talk to you about opportunities to sponsor us. It&rsquo;s our way of making internet advertising something to look forward to.</p>
