Poetry Northwest is one of Seattle's great treasures &mdash; a journal that's been publishing since 1959. We're thrilled to have them as a sponsor this week. Their upcoming issue &mdash; available the first week of April &mdash; is a must-read. Maybe don't judge it only by its cover, but that image by David Hytone is enough to get us excited. In fact, did you know that none other than Mark Tobey did their early cover art?

You can see some representative work <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">on our sponsors page</a> &mdash; it's worth your time. While you're there, click over to grab a subscription. If you're a poetry fan in Seattle and you don't already have one, <a href="http://www.poetrynw.org/subscribe/" title="Subscribe">now is time to remedy that</a>.

If you're a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, [take a look at our open dates](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/).
