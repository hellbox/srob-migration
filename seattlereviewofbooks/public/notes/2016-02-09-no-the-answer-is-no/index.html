        <p>The rule of thumb about questions in headlines — that most headline questions can be answered, simply, &ldquo;no&rdquo; — has never been more true than <a href="https://janefriedman.com/paid-book-reviews/">in this blog post</a>, which is headlined &ldquo;Are Paid Book Reviews Worth It?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that paid book reviews existed, but now I&rsquo;m horrified to learn that they do. Here&rsquo;s the thing: if you&rsquo;re paying for a review, the likely audience of that review is just going to be a bunch of authors who have also paid for reviews. Readers can instinctively detect insincerity in a review, and these kinds of mercenary reviews are very likely to be poorly written. A poorly written book review is about as useful to society as Ted Cruz&rsquo;s thoughts on feminism.</p>

<p>Now that I know there&rsquo;s a whole paid-book-reviewing industry, I just want to state for the record that the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> has never and will never accept money in exchange for book reviews. That flies in the face of the very idea of book reviewing.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t pay for book reviews. Pay for advertising instead. It&rsquo;s more honest. (And if I may, allow me to <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">make a humble suggestion</a> about the kind of not-terrible internet advertising you could buy.)</p>
