**1**. Saturday, October 3rd was 24-Hour Comics day, in which cartoonists write and draw a full comic book in a single day. Local cartoonist Henry Chamberlain just [posted his 24-hour comic](http://comicsgrinder.com/2015/10/04/24-hour-comics-day-2015-hotel-hotel-and-the-fremont-troll/), which stars the Fremont Troll, at the [Comics Grinder](http://comicsgrinder.com/2015/10/04/24-hour-comics-day-2015-hotel-hotel-and-the-fremont-troll/).

**2**. Over at *Okey Panky*, [Isaac Cates contributes a handful of comic strips](http://okeypanky.com/post/130547990309/comic-draw-two-panels-by-isaac-cates) based on a comics game of his own invention: select two comics panels from a deck of previously-created panels. Your job is to illustrate two panels that connect them. (My favorite part of the game: in the end, all four panels, including the middle two you've created, go back into the deck, thereby adding to the possibilities for future installments.) What follows is a wonderful meditation on poetry, comics, and the connection between the two. The form and content of Cates's "essay" mirror each other beautifully. 

(*This post has been updated to reflect the fact that Cates is the inventor of the panel-selection game.*)
