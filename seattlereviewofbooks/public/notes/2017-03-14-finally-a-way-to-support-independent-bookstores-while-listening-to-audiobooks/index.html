      <div class="content">
        <p>In <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/with-a-single-step/">my review of the audio version of <em>Seveneves</em> yesterday</a>, I wrote about Libro.fm, an audiobook provider that partners with independent bookstores. Every time you purchase an audiobook through Libro.fm, you support the indie bookstore of your choice. (Local bookstore participants in the program include Eagle Harbor Book Company, Edmonds Bookshop, the Elliott Bay Book Company, Island Books, Liberty Bay Books, Phinney Books, Third Place Books, University Book Store, and Village Books.)</p>

<p>But recently, <a href="https://libro.fm/membership">Libro.fm opened up a new membership program</a> that&rsquo;s pretty exciting: it&rsquo;s basically an indie version of Amazon&rsquo;s Audible monthly membership: for $14.99 a month, you buy an audio book. If you buy more than one audiobook per month, you get 30 percent off every other purchase on Libro.fm. You get to keep your audiobooks if you choose to end your membership, and a portion of your membership fee goes to the independent bookstore of your choice. I hope if you&rsquo;re a member of Audible you&rsquo;ll consider making the leap to Libro.fm; I know I&rsquo;m going to join as soon as I&rsquo;ve listened through the audiobooks I&rsquo;ve already purchased.</p>
