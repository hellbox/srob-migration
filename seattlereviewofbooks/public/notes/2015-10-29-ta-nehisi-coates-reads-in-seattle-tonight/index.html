      <div class="content">
        <p>As I noted in my <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/26/your-week-in-readings-the-best-events-from-october-26th-to-november-1st/">Week in Readings</a> post on Monday, Ta-Nehisi Coates reads from his new book, <em>Between the World and Me</em>, tonight as part of the 2015-2016  Seattle Arts &amp; Lectures season. The reading is <strong>long since sold out</strong>; if you don&rsquo;t have tickets already, you are out of luck.</p>

<p>But allow me to take this opportunity to tell you something: if you haven&rsquo;t yet read Coates&rsquo;s book <em>Between the World and Me</em>, you are missing out on <strong>the most important book of the year</strong>. I <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-seattle-of-your-nightmares/">wrote a review of the book</a> when it was released this summer. My review incorporated some then-current events, particularly the Black Lives Matter protesters who interrupted a Bernie Sanders rally in Westlake Park and in so doing kicked off a racist firestorm.</p>

<p>I was wrestling at the time — still am, really — with the hypocrisy of Seattle&rsquo;s progressive self-perception. This is a racist city, and it refuses to recognize that it is a racist city. Seattle really needs to listen to what Coates has to say tonight. And if you think you don&rsquo;t need to read Coates&rsquo;s book, you probably do. Please <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-seattle-of-your-nightmares/">read my review</a>, and then read the book.</p>
