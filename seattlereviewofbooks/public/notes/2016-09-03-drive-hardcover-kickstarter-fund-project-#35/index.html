<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Drive Hardcover_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smallfish/drive-hardcover?ref=category_popular). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Small Fish Studios](http://drivecomic.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
A hardcover collection of DRIVE: 200+ pages of the full Act One! (And now that we're in stretch goals, the page count is growing!)
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Dave Kellett is an industrious dude. He co-directed the ambitious, and successful, Kickstarter to create the great documentary [_Stripped: the comics documentary_](http://www.strippedfilm.com/), about comic strips (really, if you love comic strips, it's worth watching), writes the comic [_Sheldon_](http://www.sheldoncomics.com/), and he's also the force behind _Drive_, a humorous sci-fi strip he's now collecting into a hardback edition. 
</p>
<p>
    Maybe all you need to know is that he named one of his characters Captain Taneel (that was enough for me), but if you need a bit more convincing, go [read the entire comic online for free](http://www.drivecomic.com/). Talk about knowing beforehand if you're going to be happy or not.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Because you like sci-fi comics, or funny comics (or both), and because you like supporting indie comics creators, or perhaps, like me, you were a backer of the original Stripped Kickstarter and you want to see Dave succeed. 
    </p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Totally rocking it. 113% pleged with 25 days to go, and a bunch of stretch goals in sight.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
