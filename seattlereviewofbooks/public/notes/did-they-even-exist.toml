If a tree falls in the woods<br>
And no one is there to hear it<br>
Does it even make a sound?

Alternative version:

If a police officer shoots a black kid<br>
and no one saw the bullet<br>
Is the black kid really dead?

If a white man goes on a killing spree is he a terrorist?<br>
Or mentally ill?<br>
Or a wolf in white skin?

If the black kid does not get a hashtag<br>
were they really killed?<br>
Are they worthy of mourning?

If no one knew the black kids name<br>
were they even a person<br>
or just a target?

If no one comes to the black kids funeral<br>
Is their mother still crying?

If the black kid does not make the evening news<br>
did they even<br>
exist?
