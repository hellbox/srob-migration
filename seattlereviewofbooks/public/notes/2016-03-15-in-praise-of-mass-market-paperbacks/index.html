        <p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1458017490866/tokillamockingbird.jpg" alt="" /></p>I can&rsquo;t stop thinking of the item from <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/14/book-news-roundup-what-does-nancy-pearls-ice-cream-taste-like/">yesterday&rsquo;s Book News Roundup</a> about Harper Lee&rsquo;s estate pulling the plug on the mass market paperback edition of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>. Mass market paperbacks, of course, aren&rsquo;t nearly as profitable as hardcovers or trade paperbacks; that&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t see them so much anymore. If you can coax audiences into paying more than double for the same set of words, I guess the thinking goes, why wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: I prefer mass markets. Always have. I prefer the size — I like how they fit comfortably in the hand. (They can even fit into the back pocket of most pairs of men&rsquo;s jeans.) They&rsquo;re easy to hold, easy to read, and a whole shelf&rsquo;s worth of mass markets, all lined up and of uniform size, are a uniquely beautiful sight. I read all of Kurt Vonnegut&rsquo;s books in mass market. When I went on a Nabokov tear in my early 20s, I actively sought out all of his novels in mass market, because they made Nabokov somehow less intimidating and more approachable.</p>

<p>Rather than running away from them, the publishing industry really ought to be embracing mass market paperbacks right now. While it&rsquo;s true that e-book sales have declined in the last year, publishers would see even more consumer investment in print if they published and promoted cheap, durable paperbacks. Why buy the e-book, after all, if you can get an attractive print version for less?</p>

<p>This is something that genre publishers have known for a long time now — it&rsquo;s why when you think of mass market paperbacks, you likely think of romance novels, or mysteries, or sci-fi. Over the last two decades, publishers have stopped printing literary fiction in mass market format, and I suspect that by avoiding the sub-$10 paperback niche they&rsquo;re ultimately preventing these books from finding a wider audience.</p>

<p>Would books like <em>Catch 22</em>, <em>Portnoy&rsquo;s Complaint</em>, <em>Fear of Flying</em>, and <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> have achieved the kind of broad cultural fame that they did without the mass market format? It&rsquo;s entirely possible. But the fact is, publishing those books in mass market certainly didn&rsquo;t hurt their popularity. By scaling down literature, making it fit in the palm of a hand for less than the price of a cheeseburger and fries at a fast casual restaurant, you&rsquo;re certainly opening it up to a new set of potential buyers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m all for books as beautiful objects — hand me a gorgeous McSweeney&rsquo;s hardcover and I&rsquo;ll coo and fondle the thing like anyone else. But I&rsquo;m also for the utilitarian appeal of a mass market paperback. There&rsquo;s something enticing about the way that all mass markets are basically shaped the same; by standardizing the form of a book to a pragmatic one-size-fits-all receptacle into which the words are poured, you are putting more emphasis on the ideas in the book. And aren&rsquo;t the ideas the point of reading in the first place?</p>
