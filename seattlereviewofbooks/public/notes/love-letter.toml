It's funny how much we ate &mdash;<br>
we couldn't stop.<br>
First dinner, then desert,<br>
then the plates and the table.<br> 
At the show, she ate the stage,<br>
I swallowed the microphones.<br>
Back at the room we ate the chairs<br>
the shower and the television.<br>
Naked, breasts poised like the dark mystery<br>
at the center of faith, she devoured the bed &mdash;<br>
nothing left.

Behind her, arms around her victorious stomach,<br>
I knew what it would take to fill us up.<br>
Nothing short of a falling chunk of sun,<br>
something nuclear come to love us clean,<br>
burn our shadow into the wall just like this.
