<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Defensive Eating w/Morrissey &amp; Comfort Eating w/Nick Cave_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/microcosmpublishing/defensive-eating-w-morrissey-and-comfort-eating-w?ref=category_recommended). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Microcosm Publishing](http://www.microcosmpublishing.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>Illustrated vegan cookbooks to soothe your troubles by "goths eating things" artist Automne Zingg and traveling chef Joshua Ploeg.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	I think it's pretty freaking self obvious, this time. First, they're cook books about vegan cuisine (which, I'm not, but go you vegans), and second they're about Morrissey and Nick Cave. Think about how many times those two musicians have fed your soul? Why not feed your body, too?
</p>

Plus, they're released by our friends at Microcosm Publishing in Portland, who put out a bunch of fantastic small-edition runs of weird, wonderful, and delightful books. They're one of those absolutely unique small American publishers that it's fun to support. 

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>


<p class="noindent">
		Because you're hungry. Because you're supporting an artist who took pain and made a humourous, serious expression. Who used the music that carried her through, and made this ode to the musicians that made it. 

</p>

Because you want to support small artists, make some kick-ass vegan food, and do it while thinking about two great musical artists who inspired generations of people going through hard times. 

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	Pretty good! They're just under 50% funded after a few days. No doubt they'll make it &mdash; get yours while you can!
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
