      <div class="content">
        <p>My diaphragm left behind<br>
A mind works funny when it comes to sex<br>
important things crash<br>
A fire wound takes everything away<br>
Random acts of nature relentless<br>
Internalized violence a fog</p>

<p>I killed the frog for science<br>
What we love we destroy<br>
Yesterday I was a sex machine<br>
My warrior searching a way to spark<br>
Internet recessions scare me</p>

<p>I wanted to sleep with him<br>
but my diaphragm was lost<br>
His talking politics turned me off<br>
What fool runs a train so fast?<br>
Dying we land in the book of the dead<br>
Damage occurs when you play the target</p>

<p>If only sex solved problems<br>
We are soon to topple<br>
Did I mention violation?<br>
Law of the strong versus the weak<br>
Mandatory sex is one way to subjugate</p>

<p>Someone was fucking in the warehouse<br>
tools got slimmed, a rack fell over<br>
solid groundwork was laid<br>
A multitude of actions equals no progress<br>
My ass plays tricks on your brain<br>
There is no time for sex unless forced</p>

<p>Did you call the powers into a meeting?<br>
The landlord too busy to attend<br>
The accountant buried in his books<br>
The secretary took notes even though no one showed<br>
The notes were scant</p>

<p>People who donâ€™t vote are like pigeons<br>
dead on the side of the road<br>
Evil an often-traveled trail<br>
Anger stores up in cellular tissue<br>
No heart can stand a broken back<br>
We must learn to ignore much of everything</p>

<p>Survival, a game we lose<br>
No jackpot named freedom<br>
When did Clockwork Orange become fun?<br>
A thrill a minute means alive<br>
An exchange of body secretions</p>
