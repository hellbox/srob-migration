The big-hearted neurologist and author has [died at age 82](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/science/oliver-sacks-dies-at-82-neurologist-and-author-explored-the-brains-quirks.html?_r=0). If you'd like to try one of his books, the obvious place to start is *The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat*, although if you're in the mood for a novel, Richard Powers's *The Echo Maker* features a Sacks-like writer. ([Some have complained](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aFDe7ntoaKbA&refer=muse) about the way Powers treated Sacks, but I respectfully disagree; in fact, my way into Sacks's prose came through *The Echo Maker*.)
