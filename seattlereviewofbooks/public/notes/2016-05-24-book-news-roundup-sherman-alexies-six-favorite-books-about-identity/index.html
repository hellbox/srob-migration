<li><p>Sherman Alexie published <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/625353/sherman-alexies-6-favorite-books-about-identity">a list of his six favorite books about identity at <em>The Week</em></a>. The books, which include Seattle author Sonya Lea, should absolutely be added to your very long list of books to check out the next time you&rsquo;re at the book store. You can also hear a great interview with Alexie about his new kids&rsquo; book <a href="http://kuow.org/post/sherman-alexie-his-new-kids-book-and-angst-being-jr">on KUOW&rsquo;s site</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>As part of their big 40th (!!) anniversary celebration, Fantagraphics announced that they&rsquo;re publishing their own institutional biography, and it sounds incredible.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>The highlight of the anniversary celebrations will be the long awaited release of [*We Told You So: Comics As Art*](http://www.fantagraphics.com/wetoldyouso/), an irreverent, 600-page oral history of Fantagraphics edited by Tom Spurgeon with Michael Dean, as told through interviews with virtually every key player in the company’s history – as well as a few of its adversaries – and copiously illustrated with hundreds of photos, comics, drawings, and rare ephemera from the Fantagraphics vaults.</blockquote>
