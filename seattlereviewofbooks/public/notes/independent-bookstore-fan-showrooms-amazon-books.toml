When the news about Amazon Books was first announced, I tweeted this out:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reward for the 1st person who takes a photo of themselves buying from an indie bookstore on their phone while standing in an Amazon Books.</p>&mdash; Paul Constant (@paulconstant) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulconstant/status/661340177055420416">November 3, 2015</a></blockquote>

If you were unaware, Amazon has [actively promoted "showrooming,"](http://www.mobilecommercedaily.com/amazon-takes-showrooming-to-next-level-with-image-recognition) which is the act of standing in a brick-and-mortar bookstore, looking at a book, and then buying it on Amazon, rather than from the bookstore. You're using the bookstore as a showroom for Amazon, but the bookstore, which pays rent and salaries and all the other expenses of running a small business, gets absolutely nothing. [BuzzFeed picked up](http://www.buzzfeed.com/danieldalton/support-your-local-bookshop?utm_term=.yxb5EGxEE#.ebMjkyQkk) my above tweet and ran it as part of a listicle about Amazon Books. My issue with BuzzFeed's listicle was that they included my tweet as a "joke." **I was dead serious**. So this morning, the good people at Shelf Awareness gave my tweet a signal boost and I clarified that I absolutely meant what I said:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Serious offer: first person who showrooms Amazon Books gets a gift certificate to <a href="https://twitter.com/ElliottBayBooks">@ElliottBayBooks</a>. Send pictures. <a href="https://t.co/h8e82wy8NA">https://t.co/h8e82wy8NA</a></p>&mdash; Paul Constant (@paulconstant) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulconstant/status/662696253621301248">November 6, 2015</a></blockquote>

It didn't take long for someone to bite. Twitter user Allison Stieger visited Amazon Books this afternoon. She found a book that she was interested in — Alice Hoffman's *The Marriage of Opposites*:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Buying this book from <a href="https://twitter.com/queenannebooks">@queenannebooks</a> after showrooming at <a href="https://twitter.com/amazon">@amazon</a> Books. <a href="https://twitter.com/paulconstant">@paulconstant</a> <a href="https://t.co/2tL4TpUrlx">pic.twitter.com/2tL4TpUrlx</a></p>&mdash; Allison Stieger (@allisonstieger) <a href="https://twitter.com/allisonstieger/status/662724992895848449">November 6, 2015</a></blockquote>

And then she bought it from the website of awesome local bookseller Queen Anne Book Company.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Done. Browsed at <a href="https://twitter.com/amazon">@amazon</a> Books, bought from <a href="https://twitter.com/queenannebooks">@queenannebooks</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/paulconstant">@paulconstant</a> <a href="https://t.co/4TBouM2Bwh">pic.twitter.com/4TBouM2Bwh</a></p>&mdash; Allison Stieger (@allisonstieger) <a href="https://twitter.com/allisonstieger/status/662727439106179072">November 6, 2015</a></blockquote>

And then she picked it up at QABC: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Done! <a href="https://twitter.com/queenannebookco">@queenannebookco</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/paulconstant">@paulconstant</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZOeVT1Ah7N">pic.twitter.com/ZOeVT1Ah7N</a></p>&mdash; Allison Stieger (@allisonstieger) <a href="https://twitter.com/allisonstieger/status/662735640631468032">November 6, 2015</a></blockquote>

So there you have it! We made history today. **Allison Stieger became the first person in the world to reverse-showroom Amazon Books**, and she bought the world's first reverse-showroomed book at Queen Anne Book Company. Congratulations, Allison Stieger and Queen Anne Book Company! You've showroomed the showroomer. And Elliott Bay Book Company thanks you for it:
