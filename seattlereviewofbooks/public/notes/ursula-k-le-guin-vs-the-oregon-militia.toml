According [to ThinkProgress](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/01/19/3740829/ursula-k-le-guin-oregon-lte/), Ursula K. Le Guin wrote an angry letter to the *Oregonian* in response to what she perceived as a pro-militia front page article. 

<blockquote>Ammon Bundy and his bullyboys aren’t trying to free federal lands, but to hold them hostage. I can’t go to the Malheur refuge now, though as a citizen of the United States, I own it and have the freedom of it. That’s what public land is: land that belongs to the public — me, you, every law-abiding American. The people it doesn’t belong to and who don’t belong there are those who grabbed it by force of arms, flaunting their contempt for the local citizens.</blockquote>
