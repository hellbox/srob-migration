<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday April 27:  Local Voices**</h5></p>
Seattle Arts and Lectures’ Writers in the Schools program delivers some of the best Seattle-area writers (and visiting authors) to local students who are hungry for writing education. Tonight, Seattle-area WitS all-star teachers present new work, including Rachel Kessler, Sierra Nelson, and Anastacia Tolbert. *Hugo House, 1634 11th Ave, 322-7030, http://hugohouse.org. Free. All ages. 7:30 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday April 28: Hannah Faith Notess and Amelia Martens**</h5></p>
Seattle author Notess, who writes wonderful poems about the problematic experiences of avatars in video games, teams up with Kentucky poet Martens, whose new book *The Spoons in the Grass Are There to Dig a Moat* is a beautiful little collection of prose poems about nature and Jesus and IKEA housing for refugees. *Queen Anne Book Company, 1811 Queen Anne Ave N., 284-2427, http://qabookco.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday April 29: Tod Marshall, Heather McHugh & Lucia Perillo**</h5></p>
Three Washington poets celebrate the end of National Poetry Month at downtown’s newest literary events space. McHugh (who does not read in Seattle nearly enough for my tastes) and Perillo are both MacArthur “Genius” grant winners. Marshall is Washington state’s newest Poet Laureate, and is a tireless advocate for local poetry.  *Folio: The Seattle Athenaem, 324 Marion St., 402-4612, http://folioseattle.org. Free. 7:30 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday April 30: Independent Bookstore Day**</h5></p>

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday May 1: Weed & Memoir
**</h5></p>
While there will be no pot sold or consumed on Hugo House’s premises for this event, organizer David Schmader wants you to, if at all possible, show up stoned. Schmader, Angela Garbes, and Tina Rowley will read original memoir pieces, and readers including Charles Smith and Michelangelo Matos will read provocative pieces from entertainingly trashy celebrity autobiographies.*Hugo House, 1634 11th Ave, 322-7030, http://hugohouse.org. $5. All ages. 7 p.m.*


<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday May 2: Pamela Haag**</h5></p>
<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1461388377379/gunning%20of%20america.jpg)</p>Americans feel helpless when it comes to the gun epidemic in part because we’ve been bamboozled by advertising.  Haag is the author of *The Gunning of America*, which tells the true story of how America’s gun-crazy culture was created by marketing campaigns bought and created by the gun industry. *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7 p.m.*


<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday May 3: Black Box: A Record of the Catastrophe**</h5></p>
*Black Box: A Record of the Catastrophe* is a new journal of “various timely and timeless political and philosophical propositions,” mostly devoted to the idea of revolution. Tonight, local contributors including Charles Mudede, Alejandro de Acosta, Emily Abenfroth, and Corianton Hale will read and discuss what *Black Box* means to them. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *
