      <div class="content">
        <p>Since you mention it, I think I will start that race war.<br></p>

<p>I could’ve swung either way? But now I’m definitely spending<br>
the next 4 years converting your daughters to lesbianism;<br>
I’m gonna eat all your guns. Swallow them lock stock and barrel<br>
and spit bullet casings onto the dinner table;</p>

<p>I’ll give birth to an army of mixed-race babies.<br>
With fathers from every continent and genders to outnumber the stars,<br>
my legion of multiracial babies will be intersectional as fuck<br>
and your swastikas will not be enough to save you,</p>

<p>because real talk, you didn’t stop the future from coming.<br>
You just delayed our coronation.<br>
We have the same deviant haircuts we had yesterday;<br>
we are still getting gay-married like nobody’s business<br>
because it’s still nobody’s business;<br>
there’s a Muslim kid in Kansas who has already written the schematic<br>
for the robot that will steal your job in manufacturing,<br>
and that robot? Will also be gay, so get used to it: </p>

<p>we didn’t manifest the mountain by speaking its name,<br>
the buildings here are not on your side just because<br>
you make them spray-painted accomplices.<br>
These walls do not have genders and they all think you suck.<br>
Even the earth found common cause with us<br>
the way you trample us both,</p>

<p>oh yeah: there will be signs, and rainbow-colored drum circles,<br>
and folks arguing ideology until even I want to punch them <br>
but I won’t, because they’re my family,<br>
in that blood-of-the-covenant sense.<br>
If you’ve never loved someone like that<br>
you cannot outwaltz us, we have all the good dancers anyway.</p>

<p>I’ll confess I don’t know if I’m alive right now;<br>
I haven’t heard my heart beat in days,<br>
I keep holding my breath for the moment the plane goes down<br>
and I have to save enough oxygen to get my friends through.</p>

<p>But I finally found the argument against suicide and it’s us.<br>
We’re the effigies that haunt America’s nights harder<br>
the longer they spend burning us,<br>
we are scaring the shit out of people by spreading, <br>
by refusing to die: what are we but a fire?<br>
We know everything we do is so the kids after us<br>
will be able to follow something towards safety;<br>
what can I call us but lighthouse,</p>

<p>of course I’m terrified. Of course I’m a shroud.<br>
And of course it’s not fair but rest assured,<br>
anxious America, you brought your fists to a glitter fight.<br>
This is a taco truck rally and all you have is cole slaw.<br>
You cannot deport our minds; we won’t<br>
hold funerals for our potential. We have always been<br>
what makes America great.</p>
