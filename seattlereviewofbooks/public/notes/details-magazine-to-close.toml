<blockquote>The December issue of *Details* magazine will be its last, making the men’s fashion title the latest casualty of the declining print advertising market.</blockquote>

While I'm not going to shed a tear for *Details* — I haven't read a copy in at least a decade — this is [not good news for writers](http://www.wsj.com/articles/conde-nast-to-shutter-details-magazine-1447869601). It's hard out there for freelancers, and only getting harder. Combine this with news that [Gawker laid off writers yesterday](http://www.theawl.com/2015/11/accounts-disabled) in their ill-advised attempt to rebrand as a politics site and you've got another step forward in the consolidation of an already-rough market.
