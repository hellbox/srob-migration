It's almost time for holiday shopping. But before we get down to the arduousness of — ugh — *buying books for other people*, you should visit [Third Place Books](http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/) and Third Place Books Ravenna this weekend. On Saturday and Sunday, all used books in both locations are 40 percent off. It's one of my favorite book sales of the year, and a great chance to get some selfish book-buying done before it's time to start thinking of other people again.
