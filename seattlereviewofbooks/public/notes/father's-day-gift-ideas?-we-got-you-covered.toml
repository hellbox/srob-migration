Sponsor Paul Mullin has your Father's Day gift covered. His book _The Starting Gate_ is part memoir, part life-manual, and all entertainment. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">You can read a full chapter, that will guide you through a graduate-level course of how to drink in bars, on our sponsor page</a>. 

Of course you can buy it online, but Paul wants to be sure you know you can also pick up the book locally <a href="http://www.thirdplacebooks.com" title="Third Place Books | Books, community, events and more">Third Place Books</a>, <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com" title="Welcome to Elliott Bay Book Company online! | The Elliott Bay Book Company">Elliott Bay Book Company</a>, and <a href="http://www.phinneybooks.com" title="PHINNEY BOOKS">Phinney Books</a>. Support local bookstores, and local authors, and get that father in your life something great to read on the big day.
