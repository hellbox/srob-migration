The [*Best American Poetry 2015* controversy](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/08/so-did-i-pick-the-best-75-poems-published-last-year-of-course-not-i-picked-75-poems-that-survived-a-literary-ordeal-that-happened-only-in-my-brain/) continues with [a *New York Times* story](http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/artsbeat/2015/09/10/family-protests-white-poets-use-of-chinese-pen-name/) that suggests Michael Derrick Hudson, the white poet who took on a Chinese pseudonym in order to make some asinine "point," might have stolen the name from a real-life Yi-Fen Chou:

<blockquote>The family of a woman named Yi-Fen Chou, who attended the same high school in Fort Wayne, Ind., as Mr. Hudson, has stepped forward, demanding that he immediately stop using [the pseudonym].</blockquote>

It just gets worse and worse.
