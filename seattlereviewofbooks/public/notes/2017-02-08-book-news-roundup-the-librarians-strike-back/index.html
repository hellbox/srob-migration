<li>Have you read Seattle Public Library City Librarian Marcellus Turner&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.spl.org/about-the-library/leaders-and-organizations/city-librarian">open letter to the community</a> yet? It&rsquo;s very good:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>We celebrate Seattle's diversity and strive to ensure that all people feel welcome in the Library. We are committed to meeting the needs and expectations of every Library patron regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, culture, sexual orientation, beliefs, or income. The Seattle Public Library actively supports efforts that combat prejudice, stereotyping and discrimination.</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Speaking of librarians classily sticking it to President Trump, <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/librarians-take-up-arms-against-fake-news/">this <em>Seattle Times</em> story from Jerry Large</a> about a school librarian teaching kids how to identify and respond to fake news is very good:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Besides running the library, [Lakeside School librarian Janelle] Hagen said, she teaches a class called “digital life.” She meets with fifth-graders twice a week and with eighth-graders once a week. The classes are a mix of technology and information-literacy skills, but since the presidential election, she’s increased the focus on the latter.</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Seattle art critic (and, full disclosure, my dear friend) Jen Graves announced on Twitter this morning that she has resigned from <em>The Stranger</em>:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I spent months resisting the reality that The Stranger is not currently a viable place for me to do the work I&#39;ve always cared about.</p>&mdash; Jen Graves (@JenGraves) <a href="https://twitter.com/JenGraves/status/829365687046926336">February 8, 2017</a></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Graves was <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2014/04/14/the-nine-pieces-that-made-jen-graves-a-pulitzer-prize-finalist">shortlisted for a Pulitzer Prize in 2014</a>. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Graves&rsquo;s work, or if you need a refresher on why she&rsquo;s such an exceptional writer, you should read <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/body-of-work/">Cate McGehee&rsquo;s wonderful review of Maggie Nelson&rsquo;s book <em>The Argonauts</em></a> that serves as an appreciation of Graves:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>I consider Nelson one of my own mothers, as do many women I know. Another mother-to-many is the art critic Jen Graves, who’s been been writing for The Stranger for over ten years, bringing two English degrees and a keen eye for personal appearance to her weekly reviews.</blockquote>

<li><p>Today and next Wednesday, Northwest Film Forum is hosting <a href="http://www.nwfilmforum.org/live/page/calendar/4278">screenings of <em>I Think You Are Totally Wrong: A Quarrel</em></a>, James Franco&rsquo;s documentary about a conversation between UW writer David Shields and his collaborator Caleb Powell. Powell is in attendance tonight; Shields will appear in conversation with Charles Mudede next week.</p></li>

<li><p>On Monday, we <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/02/06/for-decades-mark-mouser-gave-authors-a-second-shot-at-greatness/">profiled outgoing University Book Store remainder buyer Mark Mouser</a>. Coincidentally, author Warren Ellis recently <a href="http://morning.computer/2017/02/the-joy-of-the-unsold-book/">wrote about the joy of finding one of his books on a remainder table</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>If you&rsquo;re looking to promote quality journalism about video games, <a href="https://store.camposanto.com/products/the-offworld-collection">this collection of video game writing from the website Offworld</a> is a gorgeous object celebrating quality writing in a space that is particularly prone to rewarding access-journalism hacks.</p></li>

<li><p>Political cartoonist <a href="http://mikelynchcartoons.blogspot.com/2017/02/clay-bennett-to-alshyster-stop-stealing.html">Clay Bennett had his cartoon stolen and manipulated</a> by a right-wing jackass on Twitter. When Bennett called the jackass out, the jackass had the nerve to say he&rsquo;d sue Bennett. Ugh.</p></li>

<li><p>Farrar Straus Giroux editorial director <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/columns-and-blogs/soapbox/article/72695-why-the-milo-yiannopoulos-book-deal-tarnishes-the-publishing-industry.html">Joy Peskin wrote a great editorial</a> about Simon &amp; Schuster&rsquo;s decision to publish the work of white nationalists:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>I’m from the children’s book world, and you may think this shouldn’t concern me. A children’s imprint isn’t going to sign Richard Spencer’s *Alt-Right Bedtime Storybook*—at least I hope not. But as a publishing professional and a citizen of this country, I would ask my colleagues on the adult side to think long and hard about future publishing deals that give a mainstream platform to the so-called alt-right and their so-called alternative facts. When a major publisher legitimizes old-fashioned hate and lies rebranded as alternative, our authors lose, our books lose, and our country loses.</blockquote>
