<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1449864678945/CV1RnZlU8AALrFu.jpg)</p>Awesome Seattle cartoonist Ellen Forney's giant portraits of hands have finally been installed at the Capitol Hill light rail station, which is (and I am pants-wettingly excited about this) set to open early next year. **Tonight at 5 pm**, Forney will be on hand at the station as part of the Capitol Hill Art Walk to sort-of christen the new artwork with [hot beverages and a public party](http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/event/capitol-hill-light-rail-murals-sidewalk-party-art-opening/). If you're a Forney fan — as everyone who's read *Marbles* or *I Love Led Zeppelin* undoubtedly is — you should show up for this one. (And you should also read my friend and former colleague [Jen Graves's interview](http://www.thestranger.com/visual-art/features/2015/12/09/23247443/how-ellen-forney-got-the-right-pair-of-hands-for-her-capitol-hill-light-rail-station-mural) with Forney about the creation and installation of these pieces.)
