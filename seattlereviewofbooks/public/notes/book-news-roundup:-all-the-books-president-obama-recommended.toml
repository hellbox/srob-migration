* Young booksellers from around the country, including a few in Seattle, are launching Indies Forward, which [Sydney Jarrard at Bookselling This Week](http://www.bookweb.org/news/indies-forward-aims-unite-young-bookselling-professionals-35475) calls "a new volunteer organization dedicated to cultivating, supporting, and sustaining the emerging generation of innovators and leaders in the bookselling industry." Jarrard continues:

<blockquote>Indies Forward, which will focus primarily on development, networking, and mentorship, will provide educational programming specifically tailored to new and emerging booksellers, on such topics as personal finance, management, and the economics of bookstores and publishing. The group plans to set up standalone networking events as well as in conjunction with regular industry gatherings so that younger booksellers will have a greater chance of being able to attend.</blockquote>
