By the way <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/25/the-hammock-where-this-site-is-written/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - The hammock where this site is written">some people write around here</a>, you'd think that only one person wrote around here. I also did a blurb about <a href="https://hugohouse.org/wherewewrite-martin-mcclellan/" title="None">where I write, for Hugo House</a>. I kept it short, but I did a much more in-depth <a href="mailto:https://medium.com/@hellbox/the-things-in-my-studio-b82c59d8a62d#.j5vg3rpzz">look at my studio when I ran my Kickstarter</a> last year. 

In my studio, I write fiction, I work on the _Seattle Review of Books_, and I ship <a href="http://californiafouroclock.com" title="California Four O&amp;rsquo;Clock by Martin McClellan">copies of my novel _California Four O'Clock_</a>. 

Where do you write? Just remember to tag it: #<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WhereWeWrite?src=hash" title="#wherewewrite">WhereWeWrite</a>.
