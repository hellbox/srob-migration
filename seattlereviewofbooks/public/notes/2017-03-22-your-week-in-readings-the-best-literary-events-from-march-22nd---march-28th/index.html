<p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Friday March 24th: <em>The Idiot</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
<em>New Yorker</em> writer Elif Batuman has only one other book to her name: a non-fiction account of people who are obsessed with Russian novelists. But her debut novel, The Idiot—about a Harvard freshman in the mid-1990s who falls in with some questionable Eastern European types—is earning praise from all quarters.

Georgetown’s Fantagraphics Bookstore and Gallery continues its recent trend of bringing international comics greats to Seattle with a rare appearance from Argentinian cartoonist Ezequiel Garcia. Garcia’s memoir, <em>Growing Up in Public</em>, is about life as a cartoonist in a society that continually devalues the importance of the arts. (Take notes, American cartoonists.)

Seattle author J.A. Jance is a total workhorse, putting out one or two mysteries every year. Jance’s fan base is rabid for her work—many are completists who have read all the dozens of books she’s written. Her latest pits two tech geniuses against each other after a cruise ship mishap starts to look like murder.
