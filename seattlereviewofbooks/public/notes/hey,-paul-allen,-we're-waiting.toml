So billionaire Paul Allen has funded a very large and very successful art fair in Seattle. [Nicole Brodeur at the *Seattle Times* just broke the news](http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/music/paul-allens-new-festival-upstream-to-mentor-and-celebrate-seattle-musicians/) that next year, Allen is funding a very large music festival in Seattle. 

So, uh, **when is Paul Allen going to get around to funding a very large book festival in Seattle**? Compared to those other two festivals, this one will be a bargain to put on. Hell, I bet if Allen committed a quarter of the cost of his music festival to books, it would be one of the biggest, best literary festivals in the world â€” the kind of literary festival that Seattle deserves.
