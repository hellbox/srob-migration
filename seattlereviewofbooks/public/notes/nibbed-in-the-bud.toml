Cartoonist Matt Bors just announced that his online cartooning hub The Nib has parted ways with blogging site Medium. Of the split with Medium, Bors simply says "our ambitions diverged," and he promises that "I donâ€™t think it will be long until I have something to announce" in terms of The Nib finding a new home. Let's hope not; The Nib has been publishing some great comics on a regular basis and in its short year and a half of existence, it became a destination for those in search of good comics on the web. This is something the internet desperately needs.
