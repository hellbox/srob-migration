If you're looking to get out of town for a bit this weekend, [consider this](https://www.facebook.com/events/165451830462479/): Washington state publisher Two Sylvias Press is having an open house at their new offices in Kingston from 11 am to 5 pm, with wine, food, authors, and books for sale. Two Sylvias, of course, was founded by Kelli Russell Agodon, who was [the very first poet we published here at the *Seattle Review of Books*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/04/argument-waltz-with-pessimistic-drowning/). They've also published books by *SRoB* contributors [Susan Rich](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/the-seattle-school/) and [Michelle Pe√±aloza](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/15/we-walk-a-heart-around-lake-union/), as well as the estimable [Esther Altshul Helfgott](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/authors/esther-altshul-helfgott/). The offices are a short walk from the Kingston ferry terminal. Seems like a great way to spend a fall afternoon.
