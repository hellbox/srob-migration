<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**What's the best way to call out a book liar? There's this awful woman dating a friend of mine, and we're all at the same parties, and she says "Oh yes, I loved it!" anytime you ask her if she's read anything. **</p>

<p><strong>Have you read <em>2666</em>? &ldquo;Oh yes, I loved it!&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Have you read the Knausgaard? &ldquo;Oh yes, I loved it!&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Have you read the Voynich manuscript? &ldquo;Oh yes, I loved it!&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Have you read the secret novel tattooed on Nicolas Cage&rsquo;s inner thigh? &ldquo;Oh yes, I loved it!”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ugh! I wish she&rsquo;d just say &ldquo;No, tell me about it&rdquo; or something. So, I decided next time I see her enough of this being nice shit, I&rsquo;m going to call her out. You&rsquo;re mean and seem to not mind making people uncomfortable in public. How do I do this?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Pansy, White Center**</p>
 

<p class="noindent">Dear Pansy,</p>
 

<p class="noindent">I think the better questions are, why do you care if someone else lies about reading books that you’ve read? How does it diminish your pleasure in having read them? If she bugs you so much, why not just avoid asking her about books — or rephrase your questions. Ask her “what are you reading right now?” or follow up with, “what did you love best about Nicolas Cage’s thigh oeuvre?”</p>
 

<p>I suspect you crave being right for its own sake, and all the better if you have an audience to witness your absolute rightness and her abject wrongness.</p>

<p>I can relate. This week I got into an argument with a coworker about which state has more trees in it – Idaho or Washington. The coworker said Washington, because Idaho is “mostly desert” according to her, and I said, “actually, Idaho is about 12,000 square miles larger and only the southern part of the state is high desert, much like the eastern half of Washington.” I do not like this coworker; she suspects rainbows are chemtrails that turn people gay and once accused the sun of being Mexican for giving her a tan. So when all of our coworkers and the internet agreed that she was probably right – Washington is called the Evergreen State, after all – my first thought was, “I’ll just start a few forest fires and we can resume this discussion next week.”</p>

<p>But being right doesn’t make you a hero and it doesn’t mean you win. Often, people just think you’re an asshole for proving how right you can be at the expense of a national forest or two.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d advise you not to confront this woman. However,if you absolutely cannot leave it alone because, like me, you are deeply flawed, here is what you do: the next time you’re at a crowded party and she professes love for a book you suspect she hasn’t read, point directly at her face and start screaming, “LIAR LIAR PANTS ON FIRE! LIAR LIAR, PANTS ON FIRE!” If you have a lighter handy and she is willing to stand still, attempt to light her pants on fire until someone physically restrains you. That’ll ensure she never wants to talk books with you again. Meanwhile, everyone else at the party will decide you’re a complete freak instead of a run-of-the-mill asshole, and forgive you more readily for your outburst.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
