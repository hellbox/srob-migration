* Congratulations are due to Chris Higashi, the director of the Washington Center for the Book. [Mary Ann Gwinn at the *Seattle Times* reports](http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/we-are-all-completely-beside-ourselves-is-new-seattle-reads-book/) that Higashi is receiving this year's Sherry Prowda Literary Champion Award, which is a prize celebrating a person who champions the Seattle literary community. Higashi is a powerhouse who curates the library's reading series and many of the library's wonderful literacy programs. She is exactly the kind of person the library should be emulating; let's hope this award underlines that fact.

* Here's a very neat project: "[Web Safe 2k16](Web Safe 2k16 is a literary/graphic project exploring our memories of the pre-broadband Internet and related technologies.) is a literary/graphic project exploring our memories of the pre-broadband Internet and related technologies." Organizers are asking 216 different writers to offer 216 words on each of the 216 Web Safe colors. So far, only a handful of colors have been claimed. Go [read them all](http://websafe2k16.com/).

* It was apparently very hard to find pirated comics last week. Why is that? [Bleeding Cool explains](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/02/22/why-comic-piracy-suffered-a-temporary-setback-last-week/) that the one British person who uploads the vast majority of all pirated scans of comics â€” was busy "moving house. "Nemesis43 has become so ubiquitous in the comic book pirating scene that everyone else has, basically, stopped," Bleeding Cool reports.

* The US military has blocked a shipment of printed material, including the new Molly Crabapple book, from reaching Chelsea Manning, [BuzzFeed's CJ Claramella reports](http://www.buzzfeed.com/cjciaramella/military-blocks-stories-about-prisoner-issues-from-reaching#.xcN3exyee). *Seattle Review of Books* cofounder Martin McClellan [reviewed Crabapple's book back in December](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/crow-quill-pen-and-bible-black-ink/).
