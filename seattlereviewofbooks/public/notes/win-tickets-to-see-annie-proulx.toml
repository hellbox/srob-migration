We're teaming with this week's sponsor <a href="http://www.lectures.org" title="Seattle Arts &amp;amp; Lectures">_Seattle Arts &amp; Lectures_</a> to give away tickets to see Annie Proulx talk on June 23rd, along with a copy of her upcoming book _Barkskins_. It's easy to enter &mdash; <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">just head to our sponsor's page</a>, and click the link to join our mailing list.

Have you seen _Seattle Arts &amp; Lectures_ <a href="http://www.lectures.org/season/" title="Seattle Arts &amp;amp; Lectures \ SAL Season">upcoming season</a>?

We're so excited to see the people they have coming to town.
