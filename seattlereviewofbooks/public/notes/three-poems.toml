disturbed bodies<br>
(ours)<br>
and on the other side<br>
a moon<br>
possibly&hellip;<br>
watching<br>

<div class="break"></div>

switching pens there<br>
subtle hope<br>
& your tired body<br>
tired<br>
breathing hard&hellip;<br>
to exist

<div class="break"></div>
 
My minor violence<br>
Toward the gazelle<br>
Is unforgivable<br>
Now making lists<br>
Of the longing that will stay&hellip;<br>
And the longing that<br>
Will be fixed in images<br>
Hatred splits us<br>
But its necessity<br>
Is like water<br>
And love
