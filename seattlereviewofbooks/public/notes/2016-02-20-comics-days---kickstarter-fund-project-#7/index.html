        <p class="intro">Every week, the _Seattle Review of Books_ backs a Kickstarter, and writes up why we picked that particular project. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/08/announcing-the-seattle-review-of-books-kickstarter-fund/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Announcing the Seattle Review of Books Kickstarter Fund">Read more about the project here</a>. Suggest a project by writing to _kickstarter_ at this domain, or by <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - About the Seattle Review of Books">using our contact form</a>.<p>

<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">_[Comics days](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/comicsdays/comics-days?ref=discovery)_. We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Kristina Vilciauskaite Shephard](http://comicsdays.weebly.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>Comics days in Vilnius is the first international comics festival in Lithuania that will be held on 14 - 16 of April 2016.

</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Independant comics festivals are the best. It's important for creators to have a place to gather and share their art, and talk to like-minded people to learn and make community. Think about how [vibrant our own Short Run Comix and Arts Festival is](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/short-run-for-the-long-haul/). 
</p>

<p>So here are some folks trying to stage an international comics festival in Lithuania, called Comics Days, and it will be the first of its kind over there. That&rsquo;s a project we can get behind.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">I'm guessing most of you reading this aren't in Lithuania, or aren't planning to visit for the festival. So, this raises the important question: _what's in it for me_?</p>

<p>Art and comics! Look at their rewards. For as little as $5 you can get a sticker pack. There are posters, comics, and even original art. And the branded gear is beautiful, as are the posters. I know a few of you reading this salivate at the idea of some rare, cool foreign art in your collections. Here&rsquo;s your opportunity to snag some.</p>

<p>Not to mention you&rsquo;re helping creators overseas get their community going. That&rsquo;s worth a few bucks.</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">21 days to go, and they've only raised about 18% of their $4,500 goal. So, they need the help. Pitch a bit in, let your friends know &mdash; those emails that a friend just backed a project on Kickstarter are pretty powerful. Let's see if we can't give them a little bit of a boost.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
