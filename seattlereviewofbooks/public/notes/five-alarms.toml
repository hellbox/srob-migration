Vancouver has an<br>
approved fireworks<br>
competition.

But here the<br>
only permitted explosions<br>
are gas leaks.

Through Greenwoodâ€™s<br>
skeleton<br>
(this neighborhood<br>
always burning down) 

with my sister, the arted-up<br>
boarding for windows of still open<br>
businesses.

Block long fenced off gravel<br>
pit where I once ate gyros

with my nephew. (this neighborhood<br>
is always coming up) The<br>
Cyclery, the reading center are Causes,<br>
rally points, easily raised funds to move

ahead. The family<br>
owned coffee shop<br>
not so much, just another, 

plus,

they live a few miles south and<br>
their house is being destroyed<br>
to make way for an oncoming train<br>
station.
