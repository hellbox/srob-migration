        <p>We&rsquo;ve known for years that <em>Dilbert</em> cartoonist Scott Adams is a dipshit men&rsquo;s rights activist. He compares <a href="http://comicsalliance.com/scott-adam-sexist-mens-rights/">women who want equal pay to children</a>. He&rsquo;s said <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/scott-adams-consent/">awful things about consent</a>. He endorsed Donald Trump and praised his &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/126589300371/clown-genius">clown genius</a>&rdquo; for a year before the election.</p>

<p>Adams may be a jackass, but he is not, strictly speaking, an idiot. He&rsquo;s kept his politics out of his comic strip, because he understands that people like <em>Dilbert</em> for its inane &ldquo;boy-oh-boy-bosses-sure-do-suck-am-I-right?&rdquo; gloss on office politics. If he were to start bleating his politics in his strip, people might start noticing <em>Dilbert</em> for the first time in years. And when people notice a comic strip, that&rsquo;s usually bad news for cartoonists. Comic strips have coasted along in the same haze of mediocrity for decades now. But newspapers are always looking for ways to cut costs nowaday â€” I&rsquo;m sure some editors would love to cut a suddenly controversial strip from their pages if it meant they could save a little cash.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, this Sunday&rsquo;s <em>Dilbert</em> was the first time that Adams&rsquo;s politics overtly bled over onto the comics pages. <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2017/05/14/scott-adams-embarks-on-the-johnny-hart-road/">P.Z. Myers at Pharyngula</a> explains the politics behind the strip, which lands squarely on the side of climate change denial.</p>

<p>This strip <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/comics-universal/?amu=/dilbert/2017/05/14">did run in the <em>Seattle Times</em> on Sunday</a>. If you&rsquo;re a <em>Seattle Times</em> subscriber, you might want to <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/contact/">let the paper know</a> how you feel about Adams&rsquo;s garbage pseudo-science on the comics page.</p>
