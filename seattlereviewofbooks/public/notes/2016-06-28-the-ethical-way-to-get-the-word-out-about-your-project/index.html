      <div class="content">
        <p>When we started the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> we had two options for trying to fund our content: put ugly ads on every page, or try something experimental with a sponsorship program. There were three points that made this an easy choice:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ad rates are falling across the internet. Many sites need to place more and more ad slots just to make the same amount of money they used to.</li>
<li>The ads are gross. They track you from website to website, and the publisher has no control over what pictures or message they carry. Can you imagine a print magazine with no control of what ads are published? We didn&rsquo;t want to expose our readers to this.</li>
<li>Ads put downward pressure on editors to create clickbait headlines and sensational posts in hopes of going viral, because going viral means a payday. It homogenizes content, encourages hopping on popular bandwagons, and undervalues taking unpopular stands because they won&rsquo;t pay.</li>
</ol>

<p>But we&rsquo;re not trying to reach millions of people with this website. We&rsquo;re trying to reach a self-selecting passionate readership, who is interested every day in what we do.</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p>Last year, <a href="http://californiafouroclock.com" title="California Four O&amp;rsquo;Clock by Martin McClellan">Martin ran a Kickstarter</a>, and during that time he was looking for inexpensive ways to reach book lovers to advertise what he was doing. The big networks were too expensive, the buy-in to even the smaller ad networks was beyond his means. That&rsquo;s why, on some book websites, all you see is the same book advertising from major publishing houses that you see in magazines.</p>

<p>But what about the indies? Surely the internet should be excelling at helping small publishers, self-published authors, and local event venues a place to talk about their products. But no, there was really very little out there.</p>

<p>So we started our sponsorship program. It has a few key metrics:</p>

<ul>
<li>One sponsor buys out the entire site for a week.</li>
<li>We run a full chapter, or a few poems, or spreads of the book in question, so readers can fairly and accurately see if they&rsquo;re interested in the book without having to wade through yards of marketing.</li>
<li>We clearly denote what is sponsored content and what is editorial content, and any book that is a sponsorship is ineligible to be considered for review.</li>
</ul>

<div class="break"></div>

<p>So how&rsquo;s the program going? We sold out our full year, save for a few reserved weeks. We couldn&rsquo;t be more thrilled about it, and measuring our response in time-on-page shows us that you are clicking on the sponsorship and giving each sponsor a chance. That&rsquo;s all we ask. Give each sponsor a shot. Don&rsquo;t like it? No big deal. If you do, pick up a copy of the book, or go to the event, and tell them where you saw it.</p>

<p><a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">We&rsquo;ve just released our next block of sponsorships</a> &mdash; through January 2016. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">Take a look</a>, and if you have a book to advertise, try a week. It&rsquo;s inexpensive, effective, and helps get your work out into the world. If you&rsquo;re an indie writer, or have an event coming up you want to get the word out about, give us a try. We&rsquo;d love to show you what we&rsquo;re doing to make ads on the internet something we&rsquo;re proud to run.</p>
