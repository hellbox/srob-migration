Our sponsor this week is [Priscilla Long](http://www.priscillalong.com "Home - Priscilla Long"). You may know her from her fanastic work [_The Writer's Portable Mentor_](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780984242108 "The Writer's Portable Mentor | IndieBound"). Her new poetry collection _Crossing Over_ is being released, and she'd like you to join her at Elliot Bay Books on September 19th at 7pm for her book launch and inaugural reading. 

Read a poem from the collection on our [sponsorship page](/sponsorships), and mark the date. This is sure to be a fascinating reading. Tell her you found out about it on the _SRoB_. 

Our sponsors are not big corporations. They are working writers, artists and publishers who need a channel to reach out to the reading public. Please take a look, and help us make advertising on the [internet something we look forward to.](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/ "The Seattle Review of Books - Help us make internet advertisements 100 percent less terrible")
