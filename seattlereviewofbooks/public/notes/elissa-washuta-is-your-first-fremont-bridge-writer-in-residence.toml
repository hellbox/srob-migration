On Facebook, Seattle author [Elissa Washuta](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/authors/elissa-washuta/) writes, 

<blockquote>Here's something I'm doing this summer: hanging out in a TOWER in the Fremont Bridge and writing about the bridge, the canal, the city, the original inhabitants of this land, the now-unseen world, and my personal relationships with other bridges. Thank you to the Office of Arts & Culture Seattle for giving me this amazing opportunity. I will be posting again soon to ask for stories to help me with this project.</blockquote>

Congratulations to Washuta; we can't wait to read your dispatches from the bridge.
