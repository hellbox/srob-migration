Shelf Awareness [reports that](http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2640#m30610) Bellingham's grand old bookshop, Village Books, has opened a new, 3,000-square-foot location in Lynden, a town just north of Bellingham. Between this and the new branch of Third Place Books in Seward Park that's opening in early 2016, it's time for the media to put away the tired "bookstores are dying" narrative for something newer, fresher, and more optimistic.
