....*Outliers*, by Malcolm Gladwell. A book club for Seahawks players is the idea of defensive end Michael Bennett, who got approval from management. Bennett says his teammates seem interested, and he thinks it will be "pretty cool." Bennett discusses the importance of reading with his teammates a lot: "I tell them donâ€™t waste too much time staying on the phone all the time. Every once in awhile, open up a book."
