        <p>Last weekend’s 39th annual <a href="http://www.norwescon.org/">Norwescon</a>, as per usual, was the most fun a human being could possibly have in SeaTac. The sci-fi convention never fell for the media bombast and glitz that comic book conventions became enchanted by a decade ago; it’s always been a convention for fans and by fans, which means it’s a rare opportunity for writers and readers to get together in a low-stress, friendly environment.</p>

<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1459130880081/Apex-144dpi.jpg" alt="" /></p>The belle of the ball this year was Seattle author Ramez Naam, whose novel <em>Apex</em> <a href="http://rameznaam.com/2016/03/26/apex-wins-the-philip-k-dick-award/">won the Philip K. Dick Award</a> at the convention. <em>Apex</em> is the third and final book in Naam’s Nexus trilogy — the others are <em>Nexus</em> and <em>Crux</em> — which centers around a nano-drug that telepathically links human beings. Naam is a central figure in Seattle’s up-and-coming sci-fi scene. He was one of <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/19/seattle-reps-hard-at-this-year-philip-k-dick-awards/">three Seattle authors shortlisted for the award this year</a>, and he humbly gave acknowledgements to the other Seattle authors who were nominated whenever convention-goers congratulated him for his win.</p>

<p>The 40th Norwescon will happen over Easter weekend of 2017. If you’re a local sci-fi fan or author and you haven’t attended, you should save the date. There’s a whole community out there just waiting for you to join.</p>
