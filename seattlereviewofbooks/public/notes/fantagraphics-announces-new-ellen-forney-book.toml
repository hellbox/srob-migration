What a terrific email to get on a Thursday afternoon: Fantagraphics Books just announced that they're publishing the next book from Seattle cartoonist Ellen Forney. With her debut full-length graphic novel, *Marbles*, Forney eloquently shared her story as a bipolar artist. *Rock Steady: Brilliant Advice From My Bipolar Life* will offer autobiographical anecdotes and observations about "how to overcome the hassle of meds, recognize red flags, and other tools from her own experience of 14 years of stability - all in comics form." 

Here's the cover:

It's wonderful to see Forney publishing with Fantagraphics again — Seattle publishers should represent Seattle authors whenever they can — and it's awesome to see Forney continue to take on the stigma surrounding mental health topics.

Now, the bad news: *Rock Steady* is not coming out until 2018. Comics take time to make, folks.
