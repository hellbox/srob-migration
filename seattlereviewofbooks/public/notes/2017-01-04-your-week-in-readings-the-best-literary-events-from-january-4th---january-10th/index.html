<p><p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday January 5th: <em>The Expense of a View</em> Reading
**</h5></p>
Polly Buckingham has long been a literary force out of eastern Washington — she helped found StringTown Press and she edits at Willow Springs Books. Tonight, she reads from her new story collection with the help of another eastern Washington gem — Spokane poet Nance Van Winckel, whose most recent collection is a “poetically altered encyclopedia,” which sounds fascinating. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, <a href="http://elliottbaybook.com ">http://elliottbaybook.com </a>. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.* </p>

Seattle poet Quenton Baker hit it big late last year when he debuted his first collection, <em>This Glittering Republic</em>.

<p><h5>**Sunday January 8th: Stories from the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> **</h5></p>
It seems likely that this year will bring with it even more magazine closures, and that’s a goddamn shame. This reading of popular <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> pieces — in which local performers read work by P.G. Wodehouse, Robert Heinlein, and Shirley Jackson —  ought to demonstrate what magazines, at their very best, are capable of promoting.

All ages. 7:30 p.m.</em></p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Tuesday January 10th: Salon of Shame</strong></h5></p>
We’ve all got some residual shame in us after the godawful mess that was last year. That’s what makes the Salon of Shame so important: it’s like a ritual burning of shame, in which normal Seattleites gather to read their most embarrassing teenage writings. Come — be embarrassed, and then be free. <em>Theatre Off Jackson, 409 7th Ave, <a href="http://brownpapertickets.com">http://brownpapertickets.com</a> . $15. All ages. 8 p.m. </em></p>
