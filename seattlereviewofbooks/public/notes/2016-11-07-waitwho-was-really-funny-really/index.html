        <p>Our thanks to sponsor <a href="http://www.atelier26books.com" title="Atelier26 Books">Atelier26</a> for bringing the astounding book <em>Funny-Ass Thoreau</em> to our readers this week. The book, released officially on Tuesday the 8th, covers a side of America&rsquo;s favorite recluse not seen in his more famous writings.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">a great sample on our sponsor&rsquo;s page</a>, so we can back up this astounding statement: Thoreau was, indeed, a very funny man. But don&rsquo;t take our word for it, check out the book, and be sure to click through and pick up a copy if you like what you read.</p>

<p>Do you want to be a sponsor, like the tremendous Atelier26? We have two openings in December, and one in January, before we&rsquo;re sold out of our current run. If you have something to advertise for the holidays, now is your time! Check out the available dates <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">on our booking page</a>, or more details <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">here</a>.</p>
