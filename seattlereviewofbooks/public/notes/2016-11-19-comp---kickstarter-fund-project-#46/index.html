<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_comp_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/comp/comp?ref=hero). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Aron Fay](http://comp.design/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
comp is a redesign of the classic composition notebook––made for the 21st century.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>
    

<p class="noindent">
    Maybe it's just that I'm a sucker for a nicely reconsidered thing, but I think these re-examined comp notebooks are pretty cool. The designer put a ton of time into imagining a superior version of something utilitarian. This is something designers do, taking utility objects and refining them. To people who love design, this is a kind of sport. To people who hate design, they scratch their heads and wonder why you'd spend $19 on something you could buy at the local store for $3.
</p>

<p>But they&rsquo;re not the same, are they? The ones from the store up the street are on cheap wood-pulp paper that will fade over time. There is, of course, a pleasure in the lowbrow, in enjoying utility. This is not about that. This is about a refined product, made nice and presented in small batches. This is about a mix of high and low, and an expression of where a person&rsquo;s particular obsession can lead.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
Personally? I'd do it for the tote bag, because it's pretty sweet. A good notebook is always handy, and these, as lay-flat with the nice paper, would be perfect to write a story or a book in. If you're buying expensive notebooks with little elastic bands around them, perhaps try one of these instead? 
</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    They're 106% funded, so doing great. You're guaranteed a notebook, if you order one.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
