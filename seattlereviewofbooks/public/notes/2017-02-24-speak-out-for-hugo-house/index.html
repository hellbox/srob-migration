        <p>By now, you&rsquo;ve undoubtedly gotten into the practice of contacting your local representatives about issues that concern you. That&rsquo;s great! Now, our friends at Hugo House are asking that you momentarily set aside your Trump-related concerns so you can advocate for them.</p>

<p>As you know, developers are right now constructing a fancy new building where Hugo House once stood, and Hugo House will have a home in that building. And the House is in the running for a state grant to pay for their new home. But that grant is not yet a sure thing. Here&rsquo;s where you come in. <a href="http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/?u=480f4ff0f584adb7d49e41f7d&amp;id=b8a58371f3&amp;e=">Hugo House Executive Director Tree Sweonson writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>You can make a big difference by contacting your State legislators to let them know why you think it's important to have public support for a new and permanent home for Hugo House.</blockquote>

<p>You can find a sample email and a link to a site that will tell you who represents you in the state legislator <a href="http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/?u=480f4ff0f584adb7d49e41f7d&amp;id=b8a58371f3&amp;e=">right here</a>. If you&rsquo;ve bemoaned the loss of important institutions during the Seattle real estate boom, this is your chance to speak out, to ensure that one piece of Seattle that&rsquo;s been around for decades continues to have a new life in the decades to come. Go make yourself heard.</p>
