See our Literary Event of the Week column for more details.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday December 15th: *Hola and Goodbye* Reading**</h5></p> 
Seattle author Donna Miscolta’s new book of linked short stories, *Hola and Goodbye* follows multiple generations of women in a Latinx family as they come to America and forge new paths for themselves, facing tremendous sexism, racism, and economic barriers. This is a heartfelt American story that was published at exactly the right time.
 *Third Place Books Seward Park, 5041 Wilson Ave S, 474-2200, http://thirdplacebooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. * 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday December 17th: Holiday Story Time**</h5></p> 
Elliott Bay Book Company traditionally hosts kids’ readings on Saturday mornings. (They’ve been much better-attended since the store moved from Pioneer Square to Capitol Hill.) The final edition of the year is a special holiday-themed reading for kids read by “a local Seattle actor.” 
 *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 11 a.m.*  

<h5>**Monday December 19th: The Beautiful Struggle
**</h5></p> 
 In a conversation facilitated by the good people at Seattle Public Library, Luzviminda Uruzi "Lulu" Carpenter leads Seattle-area LGBTQ leaders (including Dominique Stephens, Luis Fernando Ramirez, and Sonj Basha) in a conversation about surviving violence of all stripes (racism, transphobia) and building communities together.
*Gay City, 517 E Pike St., 860-6969, http://spl.org. Free. All ages.* 

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1481264572552/grinch.png)</p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Tuesday December 20th: <em>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
<em>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</em> is a holiday classic that even managed to survive the apocalyptic threat of that Jim Carrey-starring abomination that Hollywood shat up a while back. Today, University Book Store hosts a reading of Dr. Seuss’s Christmas classic for young audiences. Take part in the tradition. <em>University Book Store,  4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, <a href="http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/">http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/</a>. Free.
