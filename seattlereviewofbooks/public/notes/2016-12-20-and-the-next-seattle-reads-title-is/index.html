        <p>The Washington Center for the Book just <a href="http://www.spl.org/audiences/adults/seattle-reads">announced their 2017 Seattle Reads title</a>. From May 8th to 11th, Angela Flournoy will read from her debut novel <em>The Turner House</em> in locations around the city. SPL locations will carry plenty of copies of <em>The Turner House</em> in stock so you can take part. Here&rsquo;s their description of the book:</p>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1482277337624/turnerhouse.gif)</p>

<blockquote>Angela Flournoy's multi-generational family drama focuses on the Turners, who have lived on Yarrow Street for over fifty years. Their house has seen thirteen children grown and flown; the arrival of grandchildren, the fall of Detroit's East Side, and the loss of a father. When Turner matriarch Viola is forced to move in with her eldest son, the family discovers that the house is worth just a fraction of its mortgage and Viola's children are called home to decide its fate. The Turners must reckon with how their past haunts-and shapes-their future.</blockquote>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be writing about <em>The Turner House</em> in the months and weeks leading up to Flournoy&rsquo;s visit.</p>
