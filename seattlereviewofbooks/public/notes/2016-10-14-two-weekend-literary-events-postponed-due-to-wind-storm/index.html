        <p>Everybody in Seattle is freaking out about the promised weekend wind storm that has whipped Cliff Mass into one of his <a href="http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2016/10/major-windstorm-tornadoes-and-much-more.html">rare meteorological lathers</a>. <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> readers should know that two scheduled readings with local authors this weekend have been postponed due to weather:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Priscilla Long’s scheduled Elliott Bay Book Company event celebrating the launch of her two new books, <em>Fire and Stone: Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?</em> and <em>Minding the Muse: a Handbook for Painters, Composers, Writers and Other Creators</em>, has been moved to <strong>Thursday, November 10th at 7 pm</strong>.</p></li>

<li><p>Jeannine Hall Gailey’s Open Books signing for her new poetry collection <em>Field Guide to the End of the World</em> — <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/and-i-feel-fine/">read my review here</a> — is now scheduled for <strong>Sunday October 29th from 4 to 6 pm</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tomorrow’s storm  looks like it’s going to be a big one, folks. Stay inside, stay warm, stay safe, buy some candles and junk food, and settle in under a comforter with a big stack of books, okay? We’re giving you permission.</p>
