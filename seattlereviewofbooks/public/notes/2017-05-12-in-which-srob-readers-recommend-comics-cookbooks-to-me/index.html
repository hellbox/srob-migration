      <div class="content">
        <p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/it-should-exist-but-it-doesnt/">I wrote that comics and cookbooks go together as perfectly as bread and butter</a>. I also pointed out that no publisher has put together a truly great, comprehensive comics cookbook. In comments on Facebook, though, a few readers pointed out that there are some more comics recipes out there for you to enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Chris</strong> suggested Tyler Capps&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.webtoons.com/en/slice-of-life/cooking-comically/list?title_no=622">weekly comic strip <em>Cooking Comically</em></a>. I hadn&rsquo;t heard of this one before. Capps uses a blend of photography and comics to lay out his recipes. I&rsquo;d appreciate a little more cartooning in his strip — the process could be slightly more stretched out and explained more thoroughly — but it&rsquo;s a neat blog and I happily subscribed to it.</p>

<p>Queen Anne Book Company bookseller <strong>Tegan</strong> recommended <a href="http://www.qabookco.com/book/9780307952172">a vegetarian cookbook called <em>Dirt Candy</em></a>, by Amanda Cohen, Ryan Dunlavey, and Grady Hendrix. This one looks like a graphic novel.  Here, <a href="http://www.dirtcandynyc.com/">from the Dirt Candy website</a>, is a sample of a couple pages:</p>

<p>Now, maybe this will make more sense once I actually look at the book. But I don&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;d have a whole book told in comics form and then switch over to prose for the recipes before switching back to comics again. Still, I&rsquo;m excited to check this book out! I&rsquo;m not a vegetarian, but I do love to cook and eat vegetarian meals, and this book looks like an interesting hybrid.</p>

<p>And <strong>Alex</strong> said that <a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/252746/cook-korean-by-robin-ha/9781607748878/"><em>Cook Korean! A Comic Book with Recipes</em></a> by Robin Ha is getting great reviews. This one does look very close to my idea for a good comics cookbook. Get a load of this chunk of a full-page spread showing off a Korean refrigerator (The next page in the book explains what everything is:)</p>

<p class="image">![](/webhook-uploads/1494573538613/Screen%20Shot%202017-05-12%20at%2012.16.29%20AM.png)</p>

<p>While none of these three recommendations quite fit the bill of what I was talking about in my post, they&rsquo;re certainly very close, and they demonstrate that people are playing around with the form. I think this proves that the field of cookbook recipes is rapidly advancing, and one day soon I will have my dream book on my cookbook shelf.</p>

<p>Most importantly, <strong>thanks to Chris, Tegan, and Alex</strong> for the tips! These are all great recommendations. I&rsquo;m excited to have a new weekly cooking blog to read, and the next time I&rsquo;m out I&rsquo;ll definitely check out these two books. If I have any thoughts on <em>Dirt Candy</em> or <em>Cook Korean!</em> after checking them out, I&rsquo;ll share them here. And if you have any other recommendations, please feel free to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/seattlereviewof/">drop us a line on Facebook</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 10:55 AM</strong>: And in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/seattlereviewof/posts/1363584823710758?comment_id=1363593100376597&amp;notif_t=share_comment&amp;notif_id=1494610769642139">the Facebook comments to this post</a>, Seattle cartoonist <strong>Colleen Frakes</strong> writes:</p>

<blockquote>The [Trees & Hills Comics Group](http://treesandhills.org/) has put out a couple of comic anthologies about food/recipes, one was "Seeds" (that one had my egg drop soup recipe. I cook a lot of soups) and the newer one is called "Sprouts". [*Saveur* was also running comic recipes for a while](http://www.saveur.com/site?string=comics).</blockquote>
