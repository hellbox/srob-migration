We think you'll really like his week's sponsor [G.G. Silverman's work](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships). It's funny, smart, and we think that after you look at two chapters on our sponsor page, you might even want your own copy. Those chapters will only be up through tomorrow, so [go take a look today](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships)!

G.G. partnered with us as part of our drive to make [internet advertising 100 percent less terrible](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/). We ask that you look at our sponsors each week, and see if they speak to you. That's it! Let's change the future of sponsorship together.
