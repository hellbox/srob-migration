<li><p>We <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/01/26/the-new-york-times-bestseller-list-is-getting-downsized/">told you yesterday</a> that the <em>New York Times</em> seems to be removing a number of categories from its popular bestseller list feature. Starting early in February, they won&rsquo;t be publishing bestseller lists for graphic novels, mass market paperbacks, and certain lists for middle readers and young adults.</p></li>

<li><p>This story has developed since then.</p></li>

<li><p>Alexander Lu <a href="http://www.comicsbeat.com/the-stunning-reason-why-the-ny-times-eliminated-comics-related-bestseller-lists/">at Comics Beat</a> asked the <em>New York Times</em> why this change was happening, and the <em>Times</em> responded that &ldquo;the discontinued lists did not reach or resonate with many readers.&rdquo; Lu indicates that there may be some anti-comics sentiment inside the <em>Times</em>:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>A source indicated to The Beat that Pamela Paul, editor of the *New York Times Book Review*, was ultimately responsible for the policy shift. A recent tweet [by Paul] about John Lewis’, Andrew Aydin’s, and Nate Powell’s March began with “hey, kids” and called the comic a “children’s book.”</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>That aforementioned tweet is hopelessly ignorant about one of the most powerful autobiographical comics ever written. And it&rsquo;s unbearably condescending to Representative John Lewis, who is a bona fide hero for his civil rights activism:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey, kids: The new children&#39;s book by <a href="https://twitter.com/repjohnlewis">@repjohnlewis</a> has set an awards record <a href="https://t.co/0bB1t46joI">https://t.co/0bB1t46joI</a></p>&mdash; Pamela Paul (@PamelaPaulNYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/PamelaPaulNYT/status/823952792175964161">January 24, 2017</a></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Susana Polo <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2017/1/26/14401436/new-york-times-graphic-novel-list">at Polygon</a> makes a great case about why the bestseller list mattered for comics:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Week after week, The *New York Times* best seller lists revealed that the American comics industry is anything but dominated by young adult men and the superhero comics they shove into plastic bags. Last week’s lists — which could now be the last ones *The New York Times* ever publishes — were topped with *Ghosts*, a female-led young adult coming-of-age story from perennial Times best seller Raina Tegelmeier, on the paperback side, and a graphic novel adaptation of science fiction grande dame Octavia Butler’s *Kindred* on the hardcover side.</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>And Calvin Reid <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/72617-publishers-respond-to-losing-some-new-york-times-bestseller-lists.html">at <em>Publishers Weekly</em></a> has an overview of how the publishing industry was blindsided by this decision, including lots of reaction interviews with publishers. If you only read one piece on all this, <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/72617-publishers-respond-to-losing-some-new-york-times-bestseller-lists.html">read this one</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Look, the newspaper industry is in trouble. Everyone knows it. But I cannot for the life of me figure out why newspaper leadership responds to budget cuts by slashing their arts coverage. The <em>New York Times</em>&rsquo;s Bestseller List is a trusted brand, one that conveys a special status to authors and publishers. It is an asset. For them to cut back on this at the same time that newspapers are trying to emphasize their value is a pretty stupid move.</p></li>

<li><p>It&rsquo;s obvious that Pamela Paul has no respect for comics as a medium. (In fact, I&rsquo;m willing to bet that she considers it a genre and not a medium.) If this was her decision, I have no faith in her leadership at the <em>New York Times</em>. I can&rsquo;t for the life of me understand why you&rsquo;d make your book review section even more elitist and condescending than it already was; it&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s actively trying to turn readers away from the <em>Times</em>&rsquo;s book reviews. When they inevitably slice away even more books coverage at the <em>Times</em>, I bet they&rsquo;ll blame it on declining readership. And I also bet none of the blame for that declining readership will fall where it belongs: with Pamela Paul.</p></li>
