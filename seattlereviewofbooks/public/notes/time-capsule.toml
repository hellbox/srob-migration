They felt the wind on the down of their necks.<br> 
After the murders, children <br>
in the town dreamed of houses 

melting into the sky.<br>
Fear built its hive inside them.

But as they grew<br> 
their memories dwindled 

like their bicycles that became too small to ride.<br>
The graves<br>
lay buried beneath the trees’

shadows. Parents split<br> 
and moved away. One sister<br> 
survived. One witnessed the dark ceiling<br>
of every midnight 

fall into her thoughts.<br>
Reminders kept surfacing: a red bike<br>
hooked to a chain link fence, 

a note folded in a pocket<br>
and put through the wash<br>
until she couldn’t read it, until

it was grit between her fingers. But<br>
she knew &mdash; _You will only be a ghost_

_sliding through the trees_.<br>
This crumbling. Once upon a time <br>
she sank her foot into the shoulder<br>
of a shovel.
