<p class="noindent">Sponsor Third Place Books, up in Lake Forest Park, is hosting an exciting evening with author Laird Hunt, to talk about his latest novel _The Evening Road_. Hunt will be joined by Third Place Books managing partner Robert Sindelar. It happens next Tuesday, April 25th, starting at 7:00pm.</p> 

If you know Hunt, you certainly need to introduction to his work. He's the author of six novels and a collection of short works. He works across various literary genres, always working to reach new, exciting ground. No doubt this is going to be a fascinating conversation with a compelling writer.
