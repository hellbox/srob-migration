I have this notion that if you live long enough,<br>
there are three or four great stories that you will have in your life. 

A story of a journey or a transformation.<br>
A story of love, which will likely mean the loss of love, a story 

of loss. And a story of spiritual illumination,<br>
which, for many, will probably be the moment of death itself, 

the story untellable, its beginning and middle<br>
and end collapsing with its teller into a disappearing conclusion.

I have believed long enough in my notion<br>
to know that it is a romantic notion, that it erodes each time

I realize that the shard and not the whole<br>
comprises a life, the image and not the narrative. Otherwise,

there’s no reason why all I remember of the airplane<br>
I took as a child from one country to another

is the moist towelette packet we were given with our meal,<br>
the wonder and absurdity of it. Or that, in love, 

high in a tree in the dark, and high, he and I sat in the rain-damp<br>
branches and ate 7-11 donuts. Or this, this piece 

of a story that isn’t even mine, that isn’t even a story<br>
but a glance of an experience, of the friend who held the stray

dog after it was struck by a car. Not knowing whether the dog<br>
was dead, my friend called a friend 

who worked for a vet. Poke the dog in the eye, this friend said.<br>
Because if the animal no longer has a blink reflex, 

it probably means the animal is dead. Decades after<br>
college, when you could do such a thing, I typed his name

into a search engine to find out what became of the 20-year-old<br>
boy from the tree. Like dozens of old keys

in a drawer, so many of the wrong people with the right name.<br>
The child dead from leukemia, with a school gym

named for him. The wrestler who had a perfectly square jaw,<br>
like a cartoon police detective in a fedora.

When I arrived at a page that was certainly<br>
about him, I no longer knew the face but I recognized the life

that he had had. He had transferred to<br>
another college, gone to film school, and become a producer

of TV documentaries. A film about fishermen, the harsh fishing<br>
season in Alaska. A film about Abraham Lincoln

and a film about the last days of Adolf Hitler.<br>
A film about the Sherpas who go up and down the Himalayas.
