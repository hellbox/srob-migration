        <p>The nerd internet got very excited a few weeks ago when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgI2sRzr8I">the first trailer for the <em>Preacher</em> TV series was posted</a> to YouTube. The trailer, to me, looked like a lot of hand-waving with very little substance, but then I’ve got conflicted feelings about <em>Preacher</em>. When I was a teenager, it was my favorite comic, a huge epic story — let’s be honest, a superhero story — about good and evil and, most importantly, sacrilege.</p>

<p>I haven’t read <em>Preacher</em> in years, in part because I fear it has probably aged very badly. Even though it launched in the mid-90s, <em>Preacher</em> likely now reads like something from a long-ago era, since it&rsquo;s packed with gay panic jokes and sexism. Those were never the appeal for me; I was there for the fun of a comic which casts the Christian depiction of God as the villain. For a lifelong atheist, it was a real thrill. Maybe *Preacher*’s transgressive nature meant that it would never age well. It’s impossible, after all, to be permanently transgressive; if you seek to offend, shifting cultural norms mean that you will most likely not be able to offend the next generation — at least in the way you originally intended.</p>

<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1447308477075/STK688791.jpg" alt="" /></p><em>Preacher</em> is on my mind not just because of the trailer but because the first issue of <em>The Goddamned</em>, the new series by writer Jason Aaron and artist R.M. Guéra, was published yesterday. <em>The Goddamned</em> purports to tell Bible stories as you’ve never seen them before, which, so far as I can tell by the debut issue, means with a lot more cuss words and violence.</p>

<p>The book begins “1600 years after Eden,” with a nameless figure waking up after being brutally assaulted. He then wanders the desert, completely naked, in search of the people — or, in this case, the giants — who beat him up. Captions deliver his narration to us: “I have walked this pile of shit we call a world for 1600 years. I have cursed God every way he can be cursed, including to his face.”</p>

<p>We eventually do discover our protagonist’s name, and it reveals him as a famous Biblical figure. At the end of the book, we’re introduced to an antagonist who also is a Biblical figure. The pacing, with the villain identifying himself on the very last page, is very much of a superhero comic, but <em>The Goddamned</em> seems desperate to label itself for mature readers. It’s got bad language and nudity and violence and, I guess, “adult subject matter.”</p>

<p><em>The Goddamned</em> didn’t work for me, in part because I felt as though its edgy Bible riff might age as poorly as <em>Preacher</em> has. How many different ways can comics writers ostentatiously raise their middle fingers to the heavens? The first issue of <em>The Goddamned</em> is all attitude and posing, with no real sign that there’s anything substantial happening in the background. Maybe future issues will pay out in surprising ways. That’s entirely possible; Aaron certainly has the capacity to tell a good story.</p>

<p>If there’s a reason to pick up <em>The Goddamned</em>, it’s Guéra’s art. This is the kind of hyperdetailed style that Americans used to describe, with a certain kind of longing, as “European.” A double-page spread of the marauding giant hordes is so full of debauchery and sin that it’s like a <em>Where’s Waldo</em> of monstrosity. During the eight-page, mostly silent fight scene in the middle of the book, (another reminder of superhero comics) Guéra ilustrates violent acts with economy and gravity; you can always tell what’s going on in every panel, and he doesn’t allow the action to overwhelm the page. He keeps the panel count high, rather than blowing the fight scene out into a too-extravagant series of splash pages. His art, it must be said, is almost too good for the comic in which it appears.</p>
