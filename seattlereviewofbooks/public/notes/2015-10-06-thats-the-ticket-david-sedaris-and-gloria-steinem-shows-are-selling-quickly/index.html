        <p><strong>1</strong>. David Sedaris will be reading at Benaroya Hall on Sunday, November 15th, 2015. I&rsquo;ll be introducing him, as I&rsquo;ve done at every one of his annual Benaroya Hall appearances for the better part of a decade. The best part of introducing David Sedaris is that when you&rsquo;re done introducing him, you get to watch David Sedaris read. He&rsquo;s simply one of the funniest, best readers in the world. <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/concerttickets/calendar/2015-2016/concerts/benaroyahall/david-sedaris">Tickets for this performance are very nearly sold out</a>. The man never seems to have a bad night. Hell, he wore <em>culottes</em> last year and he still won the crowd over. How did he do it? Three words: clever dick jokes.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> One week before David Sedaris reads at Benaroya Hall, <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/concerttickets/calendar/2015-2016/concerts/benaroyahall/gloria-steinem">Gloria Steinem will be there in conversation with Cheryl Strayed</a>. This event is put on by the wonderful women&rsquo;s writing community <a href="http://www.hedgebrook.org/">Hedgebrook</a>, and it&rsquo;s not to be missed. Steinem, of course, is a feminist legend, and Strayed has become a literary voice of her generation. They&rsquo;ll be celebrating the launch of Steinem&rsquo;s new memoir <em>My Life on the Road</em>. Of course, Strayed knows quite a bit about memoirs, and about roads, and about literature. I expect these two to burn down the stage together.</p>
