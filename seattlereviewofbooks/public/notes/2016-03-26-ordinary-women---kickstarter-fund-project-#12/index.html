        <p class="intro">Every week, the _Seattle Review of Books_ backs a Kickstarter, and writes up why we picked that particular project. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/08/announcing-the-seattle-review-of-books-kickstarter-fund/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Announcing the Seattle Review of Books Kickstarter Fund">Read more about the project here</a>. Suggest a project by writing to _kickstarter_ at this domain, or by <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - About the Seattle Review of Books">using our contact form</a>.<p>

<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">_[Ordinary Women](https://www.seedandspark.com/studio/ordinary-women#story)_. We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Feminist Frequency](http://feministfrequency.com).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>Ordinary Women: Daring to Defy History is Feminist Frequency's new video series about challenging stereotypes, smashing the status quo, and being defiant.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    You may know _Feminist Frequency_, and Anita Sarkeesian, from her Kickstarter campaign for the [video series Tropes vs Women](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/566429325/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games), which you may have heard about from the absolutely ludicrous, coordinated, and [horrifying backlash against the project](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/technology/gamergate-women-video-game-threats-anita-sarkeesian.html?_r=0). The thing was that the backlash itself only proved the need for the videos she was making. 
</p>

<p>This series looks at women from history who stood out, fought against the societal roles prescribed them, and made a difference. Pretty cool.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">The more women controlled media there is, the more women-centered stories there will be. That equation is easy to understand. What's harder to understand is how freaked out certain men get by the very fact that _Feminist Frequency_ exists. They see conspiracy theories so nonsensical and overblown that, when you watch a video and find just a nicely produced video essay about presentation of gender stereotypes that is really kind of _gender &amp; media studies 101_ told in a straight-forward non-inflammatory comprehensive way with a chill narrator who patiently makes her points and throws no bombs, you end up scratching your head about why the hell they freaked out so bad.</p>

<p>Then you decide to back everything she does because you hope that, in the balance of power, people like her end up having more than the people fighting her. And, because, after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah8mhDW6Shs">seeing her talk once</a> you heard her say this great thing that has stuck with you ever since: &ldquo;One of the most radical things you can do is to actually believe women when they talk about their experiences.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">They need the help. They have 12 days to go, and they're only at under $84,000 of a $200,000 goal. They're using a new Crowdfunding Platform called Seed and Spark that is geared towards films, instead of Kickstarter this time. If you're in, better get in soon to help get them to their goal.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
