<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">_[The Chemical Wedding by John Crowley](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2142694884/the-chemical-wedding-by-john-crowley?ref=card)_. We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Gavin J. Grant &mdash; Small Beer Press](http://smallbeerpress.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>John Crowley provides the chance for a contemporary audience to enjoy the "1st science fiction novel." We want to make it beautiful.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">_Small Beer Press_ is all kinds of wonderful. The work they bring into this world is completely unique, fantastical, and the quality is always high. It's one of those presses you can trust &mdash; you may not love everything they put out, but you'll never wonder why they published a certain author. And with names like press co-founder Kelly Link, Karen Joy Fowler, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Sofia Samatar, chances are really good you actually will love it. 
</p>

<p>This project is a work by John Crowley &mdash; and yes, as a press, <em>Small Beer</em> is going to publish a trade edition of it. But this Kickstarter is to fund a special edition. So this is an illustrated special hardbound edition, available in a few different flavors.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">First, for the book itself. It looks great, and sounds interesting, as do the illustrations. Second, because we love to support presses like _Small Beer_ who forge such interesting ground. Third, because we love special edition books, and this one looks like it will be lovely.</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">They're 27% funded currently, with just under $14k pledged of their $50k goal.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
