<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 
<p class="noindent"><strong>If one more douchey techbro tells me that TV shows are the new novels, I’m going to lose my mind. It’s become the stock response when I tell my coworkers that I enjoy reading. I liked *Mad Men* as much as the next person, but watching a TV show is just never going to be the same thing as reading a book. Can you give me a pithy comeback for the next time this happens?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Virginia,</p>

<p class="noindent">You say this: "Teevee shows ARE the new novels, in the same way that reality stars are the new Leaders of the Free World."</p>

Personally, my favorite new show is *Real Housemarms of Orphan Liver Donors*, in which orphanage housemarms sell off tender young organs to the worldly battle-scarred businessmen who actually need them. I was really rooting for one of the marms to be chosen as our next Secretary of Education – they're all excellent at maximizing the potential of orphaned children's livers, just think of what they could do with the nation's young minds.

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
