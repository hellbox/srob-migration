        <p>Our thanks to Floating Bridge Press for their sponsorship this week. They&rsquo;re showing off 2015 chapbook award winner Michael Schmeltzer, and his winning work <em>Elegy/Elk River</em>. The titular poem is <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">available to read on our sponsors page</a>, and it is an amazing piece of work. His accolades are well deserved.</p>
