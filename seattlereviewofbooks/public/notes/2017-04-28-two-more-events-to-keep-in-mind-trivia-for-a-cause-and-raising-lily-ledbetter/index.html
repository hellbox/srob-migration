<p>Sometimes we hear about events too late to get them in the readings calendar for the week, but we still think they&rsquo;re worthy events that you should know about. Here are two:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tomorrow from 3 to 6 pm, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1296943443718242/">Trivia for a Cause</a> at Green Bean Coffeehouse in Greenwood. This event is a fundraiser for <a href="http://www.eastsidemosque.com/">the Eastside Mosque</a>, which was <a href="http://komonews.com/news/local/fire-burns-eastside-mosque-one-arrested">damaged in an arson fire back in January</a>. There will be readings from Seattle poet <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/02/in-response-to-cd-wrights-questionnaire-in-january/">Samar Abulhassan</a>, eight rounds of trivia, and a set from comedian Wilfred Padua. Admission is $20. If you can&rsquo;t attend because you&rsquo;re busy doing <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/04/26/literary-event-of-the-week-seattle-independent-bookstore-day/">Independent Bookstore Day</a>, you can <a href="http://www.eastsidemosque.com/">donate directly to the mosque here</a>.</li>
<li>On Tuesday May 2nd, <a href="https://townhallseattle.org/event/raising-lilly-ledbetter/">Town Hall Seattle is hosting a reading for the poetry anthology <em>Raising Lilly Ledbetter</em></a>, which celebrates women at work. I <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-ballad-of-rosie-the-riveter/">reviewed this anthology back when it was first released in 2015</a>, but now that we have a Grabber-in-Chief who surrounds himself in the workplace with aggrieved white men, it&rsquo;s even more relevant. If you&rsquo;re looking for a bit of empowerment through art, this is the reading for you.</li>
