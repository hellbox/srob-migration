This has [already appeared on the *Seattle Review of Books*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/06/the-sunday-post-for-september-6-2015/), but it's making the rounds again. If you haven't already, please read [Vijith Assar's excellent column for *McSweeney's*](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-ambiguous-grammar) about the way various grammatical tricks can completely change the meaning of a sentence. Whenever you see passive voice in the media, your first thought should always be, "who are they protecting, here?"
