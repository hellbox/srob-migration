<p><strong>MONDAY</strong> Your week in readings begins at Seattle Center&rsquo;s Artists at Play Playground at 9 pm tonight. Seattle poet <strong><a href="http://gregbem.com/wordpress/2016/01/07/ghost-tokens-inumbrating-pinnacle-details/">Arlo Smith</a></strong> reads as part of <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/15/ghost-tokens-inumbrating-pinnacle-is-a-seven-day-literary-event-in-seattle-center/">the Inumbrating Pinnacle reading series</a>, which continues all week long, culminating on Saturday night. If you haven’t been to this playground, you should most definitely go just for the spectacle of it; it’s unbelievably cool.</p>

<p><strong>TUESDAY</strong> Wage Slaves, the work-themed reading series featuring free donuts, happens tonight at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/548671758619719/">Hugo House</a>. Tonight’s event is focused on women in the workplace, and readers include <strong>Sonya Lea, Storme Webber, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/15/we-walk-a-heart-around-lake-union/">Michelle Peñaloza</a>, Tele Aadsen, and Jean Burnet</strong>. I bet there&rsquo;ll be a lot of jaw-dropping stories at this reading.</p>

<p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong> It’s back to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/909125779158570/">Hugo House</a> with you to celebrate Seattle Arts and Lecture’s incredible Writers in the Schools program, which helps young people learn how to communicate through writing. Tonight, Seattle writing instructors with WitS will read new work. Readers include <strong>Samar Abulhassan, Daemond Arrindell, Emily Bedard, Aaron Counts, Laura Gamache, Clare Meeker, Peter Mountford, Sierra Nelson, Imani Sims and Greg Stump</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>THURSDAY</strong> Good lord, it’s a three-night stand at the <a href="https://hugohouse.org/event/two-sylvias-press-presents-martha-silano-cecilia-woloch/">Hugo House</a> this week! Washington publisher Two Sylvias Press presents authors reading from their new collections. <strong>Cecilia Woloch</strong> presents her chapbook <em>Earth</em>, which won the 2014 Two Sylvias Chapbook Prize, and <strong>Martha Silano</strong> reads the second, expanded version of her collection <em>What The Truth Tastes Like</em>.</p>

<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong> The penultimate Inumbrating Pinnacle event happens at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/852248678221412/">the Armory Monorail station at Seattle Center</a> at 9 pm. Your readers are Seattle poetry stalwarts <a href="https://strainedspringsteed.wordpress.com/"><strong>Jeremy Springsteed</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/Morel/index.html"><strong>Jeanne Morel</strong></a>. Why not take the Monorail from downtown to this one? You can pretend to be a resident of Seattle’s future, circa 1963.</p>

<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong> Head to he central branch of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/190899077927330/">Seattle Public Library</a>  downtown for the first in an exciting new series put on by SPL called <strong>Page to Screen: Hear the Story, See the Film</strong>. It’s pretty much exactly what it sounds like: a reading of a short story, followed by a showing of the film adapted from that story. Today’s feature is Tod Browning’s incredibly creepy 1932 film <em>Freaks</em> — of “one of us! One of us!” fame —and a reading of Tod Robbins’s story “Spurs,” which inspired the film. It’s a neat idea, isn’t it? I’m excited to see how this works.</p>

<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong> End your week with the excellent Monorail Reading Series at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1671816129768820/">Fred Wildlife Refuge</a>. Poets <strong><a href="http://www.raulrafaelalvarez.com/">Raul Alvarez</a>, <a href="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/julie-carr">Julie Carr</a>, and <a href="http://dianakhoinguyen.com/">Diana Khoi Nguyen</a></strong> read. With plenty of booze! I can&rsquo;t imagine a livelier way to close out the week.</p>
