**MONDAY** [Third Place Books](http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/circling-sun-paula-mclain) hosts novelist Paula McLain tonight. McLain writes historical fiction, and is the author of the popular novels *Circling the Sun* (First sentence: “The Vega Gull is peacock blue with silver wings, more splendid than any bird I’ve known, and somehow mine to fly.”) and *The Paris Wife* (First sentence: “Though I often looked for one, I finally had to admit that there could be no cure for Paris.”) 

**TUESDAY**  There’s a lot going on tonight, including an interesting-looking reading called “[The Least Boring Poetry Event of the Year](https://www.facebook.com/events/707870485986183/),” which is pretty funny but which also plays into a pet peeve of mine: I can’t stand it when readings talk about how boring readings are. Stop apologizing for your art, goddamnit. But I think the most interesting event tonight is a showing of local poet Shin Yu Pai’s new project, “[HEIRLOOM](http://www.akcho.org/akchocalendar/#sthash.nWN7x7i6.dpuf).” HEIRLOOM is a poetic installation at Piper’s Orchard at Carkeek Park, in which Pai is using light and stencils to “print” words on the skin of apples. Tonight, Pai will give a tour of the orchard and read part of the poem that is being “printed” on the fruit. Tell me that’s boring and I’ll call you a liar to your face.


**WEDNESDAY** Over at Ada’s Technical Books, it’s time for another edition of their [Monthly Puzzle Club](http://www.seattletechnicalbooks.com/adas-monthly-puzzle-club), in which local puzzle aficionado Pavel Curtis talks puzzles with other puzzle fans.

**THURSDAY** Tonight is the most packed reading night of the week, but the conceit of this column is that we only choose one event a night to feature. And so we happily pick this one: [A Reading by Blue Begonia Press Poets at Hugo House](http://hugohouse.org/event/a-reading-by-blue-begonia-press-poets/). The Washington state publisher of poetry presents our state’s poet laureate, Elizabeth Austen. She’ll be joined by Elissa Ball, Nancy Rawles, and other Blue Begonia writers. We need more publishers in Washington, and the best way to do that is by promoting and supporting the publishers we already have. Go meet your new favorite poet; that's what group readings are for.

**FRIDAY** [University Book Store](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=08&evyear=2015&eventid=2015020615562300&pre=20150801&pst=20150815) hosts another edition of Nancy Pearl’s Book Club. This time, Pearl and company will be discussing Michael Chabon’s excellent alternate-history novel *The Yiddish Policeman’s Union*.  It’s one of Chabon’s strongest books, which is really saying something. It’s a novel about what might have happened if the territory we know as Alaska was handed over to a Jewish state at the end of World War II, rather than the land we know as Israel. This was a real possibility at the time.

**SATURDAY** [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/events/) hosts their  Queer Geek Board Gaming group this afternoon. Feel free to bring your own board game or join in on games including “the DC Heroes expansion, Adventure Time card game, Relic Runners, Small World and several others.”

**SUNDAY**  The Seattle Public Library’s Books on Bikes team will be promoting SPL at [Bicycle Sunday]( http://www.spl.org/calendar-of-events#/?i=6) near Seward Park. There will be a “bicycle-themed storytime.”
