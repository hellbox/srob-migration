* [Here's another sign](http://the-digital-reader.com/2016/07/25/new-survey-shows-used-and-rented-textbooks-still-trump-e-textbooks/) that ebook adoption has stalled: the "largest proportion of students, 67 percent, buys used textbooks, 55 percent rent, 25 percent buy new and 25 percent download e-books."

* Bookstore chain [Hastings is going away this fall](https://teleread.org/2016/07/22/hastings-set-to-liquidate-close-all-126-remaining-stores/):

<blockquote>After filing for bankruptcy in June, Hastings has been unable to find a buyer who would be willing to keep it in business, so it’s time to liquidate. Hastings is expected to close all 126 of its stores by the end of October.</blockquote>
