        <p><strong>MONDAY</strong>  <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/siamak-vossoughi">Elliott Bay Book Company</a> kicks off your new year of readings with <strong>Siamak Vossoughi</strong>, a short story author who is originally from Iran but who now lives in Seattle. His first collection of stories is titled <em>Better Than War</em>, and it’s a winner of the Flannery O’Connor Prize.</p>

<p><strong>TUESDAY</strong> Science fiction author <strong>Dave Bara</strong> celebrates the debut of the second book in his space opera series The Lightship Chronicles at <a href="http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=01&amp;evyear=2016&amp;eventid=2015111916092900&amp;pre=20160101&amp;pst=20160109">University Book Store</a>. In it, the crew of a spaceship must investigate a mysterious space station.</p>

<p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong> <a href="https://townhallseattle.org/event/jamie-merisotis-with-blair-taylor/">Town Hall</a> presents its first night of programming in the new year. <strong>Jamie Merisotis</strong> is president/CEO of the Lumina Foundation, and he’s interested in talking about America’s talent gap.  <em>America Needs Talent</em> is a book about how “educated, talented, and innovative individuals are needed in the United States.”</p>

<p><strong>THURSDAY</strong> <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/ru-freeman-tess-gallagher-peter-mountford-alice-rothchild">Elliott Bay Book Company</a> co-presents a reading with novelist <strong>Ru Freeman</strong> and local authors <strong>Tess Gallagher, Peter Mountford, and Alice Rothchild</strong>. They’re all contributors to an anthology titled <em>Extraordinary Rendition: (American) Writers on Palestine</em>. It features 65 pieces of journalism, essays, poetry, and fiction about the Palestinian experience.</p>

<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1451259673707/9781938466502.jpg" alt="" /></p><strong>FRIDAY</strong> It’s back to <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/ben-nickol">Elliott Bay Book Company</a> with you for a reading from a Montana-based writer named <strong>Ben Nickol</strong>, who is the author of a short story collection titled <em>Where the Wind Can Find It</em>. These are stories mostly about people who live near wildernesses.</p>

<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong> Our last visit to <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/celebration-madeline-defrees-1919-2015">Elliott Bay Book Company</a> this week is a celebration of the life of Seattle poet Madeline DeFrees. DeFrees, who <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/13/madeline-defrees-1919-2015/">passed away in November</a>, was one of the very best poets our region had to offer. Local writers including Kathleen Flenniken will be presenting her work and celebrating her life. This is not to be missed.</p>

<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong> <a href="http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=01&amp;evyear=2016&amp;eventid=2015092411030800&amp;pre=20160102&amp;pst=20160118">University Book Store</a>
closes out your week with a memoir by <strong>Katherine A. Hitchcock</strong>. Hitchcock was one of the very few women in Silicon Valley in the late 60s, 70s, and 80s, which means she helped computers transform from gigantic monsters to tiny little handheld time-sucking devices. Her memoir is titled <em>Atypical Girl Geek</em>.</p>
