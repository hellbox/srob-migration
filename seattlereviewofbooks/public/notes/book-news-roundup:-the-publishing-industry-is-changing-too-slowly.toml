* [Flavorwire reports on](http://flavorwire.com/589711/publishing-makes-little-progress-in-diversity-remains-extremely-white) a *Publishers Weekly* report on the publishing industry. The bottom line: "Publishing Makes 'Little Progress' in Diversity, Remains Extremely White." This is not good enough.

* And there's more [bad news in the *PW* report](http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/71506-the-pw-publishing-industry-salary-survey-2016.html), including the fact that women in publishing are still paid less than men. Boo.

* This came in too late for me to add to the readings calendar this week, but you should be advised that the Words West reading series will [take place tomorrow night](http://wordswestliterary.weebly.com/next-event.html) at C&P Coffee Company in West Seattle. The very special guests at this reading will be Tod Marshall, Washington State's Poet Laureate, and City Councilmember Lisa Herbold, who will share her favorite poem.This reading will also debut "**a new library featuring a book by every author who has read at WordsWest**." This is a super-cool idea.

* Do you know any teenagers who love making comics? You should direct them to the All City Comics Club, which is hosted by local comics superstar David Lasky and which takes place at the Bureau of Fearless Ideas. Here, have a flier:
