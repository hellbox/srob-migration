        <p>Swapna Krishna at Panels has <a href="http://panels.net/2015/08/31/g-willow-wilson-motherhood-and-the-comics-industry/">collected some tweets</a> by local novelist/comics writer G. Willow Wilson about motherhood and the business of art. Wilson, who&rsquo;s <a href="https://medium.com/@amandapalmer/no-i-am-not-crowdfunding-this-baby-an-open-letter-to-a-worried-fan-9ca75cb0f938">responding to a popular essay by Amanda Palmer</a>, explains that editors and publishers levy &ldquo;a mommy tax&rdquo; on writers and other artists.</p>

<p>As contractors, Wilson says, women artists have &ldquo;zero legal protection,&rdquo; and the story of her own experiences is a real eye-opener: &ldquo;I wrote ALIF THE UNSEEN while pregnant and edited it with a newborn sleeping on my chest. Toured while pregnant with kid #2&hellip;.MS MARVEL? First arc outline handed in 48 hours after the birth of Kid #2. First arc written largely while nursing an infant.&rdquo; Go <a href="http://panels.net/2015/08/31/g-willow-wilson-motherhood-and-the-comics-industry/">read the whole thread</a>. We desperately need child care and family leave acts in this country.</p>
