<p class="intro">**UPDATE**: Well, that was fast. We're sold out! If you're interested in a spot in our upcoming group of days, drop us a line on our [contact page](/about/), or mail us at _sponsorships @_ our domain.</p>

When we launched the _Seattle Review of Books_, we knew our sponsorship model was risky. It required training our readers that _advertising doesn't have to be horrible_, despite pretty much everything else you find on the internet. 

<strong>But our sponsorship model is working</strong>. It allows us to pay for the [reviews](/reviews), [poems](/tags/tuesday-poem/), and things like [memorials](/notes/2016/03/01/remembering-elizabeth-eisenstein/) for [writers](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/05/16/heroes-of-weirdness-in-honor-of-katherine-dunn/) we love, and [reporting from special events](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/04/notes-from-the-field-awp-wrap-up-the-day-after/) you see here, and allows us to work on upcoming special projects you're going to love. This is all due to our sponsors, and due to our readers checking each sponsor out, and giving them a fair shake. 

We're about to release our next block of openings, for August to January, and before we do that, we'd love to clear the last four slots we have remaining in June and July. 
* We made two slots $100 ($50 off!)
* We made two slots $125 ($25 off!)
