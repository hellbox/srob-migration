* Hollow Earth Radio has announced the lineup for this year's Magma Fest, their monthlong music festival. Why is this the top news item on a book-related website? Because they're hosting at least two book-centric events in this year's Magma Fest. On March 13th, Sara Century is presenting a [lecture on the history of LGBT characters in comics](https://www.facebook.com/events/796312913806897/) and Babel/Salvage is presenting the "[Glossophonic Showcase](https://www.facebook.com/events/561968787291416/)" on March 25th, featuring readings from Kreg Hasegawa, Lauren Ireland, Sue Landers, and experimental musicians.

* Speaking of Hollow Earth Radio and literature, Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore's story from the Furnace Reading Series on HER, "The Freezer Door," is now available on SoundCloud:

* Submissions for local literary magazine *The Raven Chronicles* [open tomorrow](http://www.ravenchronicles.org/submit/). Your editors will be Matt Briggs for fiction, Dana Dickerson for non-fiction submissions, and Rebecca Mabanglo-Mayor for poetry.

* You have no doubt heard about the Vancouver, BC, serial killer who [published a memoir](http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/worst-serial-killer-in-history-who-fed-women-to-pigs-reignites-rage-by-publishing-book/). The story gets worse the more you read about it, particularly the fact that proceeds from the sales of the book benefit the serial killer's cellmate, a convicted child molester.

* So we don't end on the worst news of the week, the [Nebula Award nominees have been announced](http://www.sfwa.org/2016/02/2015-nebula-awards-nominees-announced/)! We're most excited for the wonderful *Nimona*,  a young adult comic by Noelle Stevenson, and *Ancillary Mercy*, the third book in the series by Ann Leckie that started with [*Ancillary Justice*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/pronouns-in-space/).
