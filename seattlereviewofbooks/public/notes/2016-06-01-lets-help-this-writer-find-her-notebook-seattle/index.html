        <p>BuzzFeed writer <a href="https://twitter.com/ariannarebolini/status/738160081217298433">Arianna Rebolini</a> writes in <a href="http://seattle.craigslist.org/see/laf/5615099292.html">a Craigslist lost and found ad</a> that she lost a white Mead 5-Star composition notebook while visiting Seattle:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi! I was in your beautiful city the weekend of May 20 and seem to have misplaced an incredibly important notebook in that time. Have you seen it? It's a 5-star Mead composition notebook with a white plastic-y cover with folder inlay. On the inside you will see an index and then headings like "Emily & Nathan's relationship" and "DAY TWO" and "SSWW." You will also see fully written pages which are then completely X-ed out with giant "NO"s covering them. What you won't find is any contact info for me, and I will rue this fact until my dying day.</p>

<p>If you have this book I will pay you $$$$!!! Also, if the book I was planning in that notebook comes to fruition, I will thank you IN THE BOOK!</p>

<p>I AM LOST WITHOUT THIS BOOK. PLEASE HELP.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you see the book, please <a href="https://twitter.com/AriannaRebolini">contact Rebolini on Twitter</a> or <a href="http://seattle.craigslist.org/see/laf/5615099292.html">through Craigslist</a>.</p>
