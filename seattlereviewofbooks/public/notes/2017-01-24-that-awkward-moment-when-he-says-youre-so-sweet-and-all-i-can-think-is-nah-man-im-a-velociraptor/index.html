        <p>Velociraptors and I have faces for the movies.<br>
We have learned how to open doors: We scrape talons<br>
across the knob, sneak out middle of the night<br>
leave fading indent in the bed. He calls asking where I am.<br>
<em>I’m in your blind spot.</em><br>
I’m watching heat radiate off you<br>
as you stumble through the woods. I am attracted<br>
to movement, meaning I only chase something when it runs.<br>
Like a velociraptor, I will not text you back.</p>

<p>He kisses me like he doesn’t even know I have teeth,<br>
like I don’t mouth his neck carotid and catastrophe.<br>
He still thinks the parts of him I’ve swallowed are pieces<br>
he’ll get to keep. When he looks into my eyes, I try to seem<br>
like a warm-blooded girl, but I am a fucking velociraptor;<br>
I trace my lineage back to birds.<br>
He doesn’t understand how I can be so lizard-distant,<br>
why I don’t want to kiss him outside the restaurant;<br>
chalk it up to Cretaceous differences.</p>

<p>Squishy mammal boy, I don’t hunt in packs;<br>
I have hooks for hands and very limited patience for bouquets.<br>
If you wander into my woods, don’t be shocked when you call<br>
and I don’t answer. Check your periph; don’t ignore that rustling.<br>
You might have time for one last “clever girl” before you die.</p>
