    343.<br>
Eve of the new year. Bitter cold city. I sit by the café window, bring the soup bowl to my lips. Someone in the park across the street is swinging high on a swing-set in the dark.
</p>

<p class="prose-poem">
    344.<br>
At least one keyhole has been stuffed with tissue by a previous tenant. So there is no seeing through.
</p>

<p class="prose-poem">
    345.<br>
A very partial morning. The things I am trying constantly to re-make, alter, edit, adjust. Bring myself always back to the path, and the path is hard to find. I do not always want it.
</p>

<p class="prose-poem">
    346.<br>
The early morning young mothers’ parade. A child I cannot see, screaming, “I need it! Give me!” Complete anguish of wanting.
</p>

<p class="prose-poem">
    347.<br>
A soft rain is falling, so fine it looks like dust in the air all around us, and everyone holds their umbrellas like a gift.
</p>

<p class="prose-poem">
    348.<br>
The knives come back sharper than they had ever been—sharper than new. We arranged them in the kitchen like an arsenal. We were afraid to put them away.
</p>

<p class="prose-poem">
    349.<br>
“What is your favorite place?” I asked the tree.<br>
_The place where I am._
