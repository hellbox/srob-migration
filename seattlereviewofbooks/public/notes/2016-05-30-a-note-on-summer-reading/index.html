        <p>It&rsquo;s Memorial Day, which means summer is due to arrive here in Seattle sometime in the next two to ten weeks. This is the time of year when you see a lot of sites promote their summer reading lists. We&rsquo;ve never been especially into lists here at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>, but if you dig them, that&rsquo;s great. We&rsquo;re happy you&rsquo;ll soon have a lot of lists to choose from.</p>

<p>But the idea of summer reading has always been especially confusing. What, exactly, does summer entail? Is the summer when you&rsquo;re supposed to read &ldquo;junk,&rdquo; whatever that means? Okay. But you can read light, fluffy romances or vapid thrillers whenever you want. That&rsquo;s the beauty of being an adult: <strong>you can read whatever kind of book you choose, whenever you choose</strong>. I know people who read classics in the summer because that&rsquo;s the only time of year when they can focus enough reading energy into, say, a Dostoevsky novel. That&rsquo;s okay. Some people only read collections of poetry in the summer because they&rsquo;re too easily distracted to keep their heads in a novel. That&rsquo;s okay, too.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re looking for a summer reading list, we think you should <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/">check out our review page</a>, where we have reviewed dozens of books of all sorts — novels, short stories, classics, comics, thrillers, sci-fi — over the last year. You&rsquo;ll find something there to read, no matter what a summer read means to you.</p>
