* Seattle-area newsletter The Evergrey is [looking for your input on local small businesses to profile](https://theevergrey.com/tell-us-the-seattle-small-business-you-cant-live-without/). We're not saying you should go and suggest your favorite small bookstore or anything, but...you should go and suggest your favorite small bookstore. Deadline is Monday April 17th, and the businesses will be profiled on May 1st.

* [Brangien Davis at Crosscut](http://crosscut.com/2017/04/wave-books-seattle-wins-pulitizer-prize/) explains what happened when a title from Seattle publisher Wave Books won the Pulitzer Prize.

* The arts levy, a proposed King County ballot issue which would have funded "arts and science programming targeted at poor people and seniors," [didn't survive a committee hearing this week](http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/proposed-county-sales-tax-to-fund-arts-dies-in-committee/).

* The TV Writers Guild [might be going on strike soon](https://electricliterature.com/is-the-writers-guild-going-on-strike-fd93ead3b7ff). We stand with all unionized writers.

* Whatever happened to [Google Books](https://backchannel.com/how-google-book-search-got-lost-c2d2cf77121d)?

* Some men's rights dipshit [reviewed Harry Potter](http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2017/04/11/harry-potter-pushes-willing-cuckoldry-as-a-moral-imperative-weirdo-nazoid-pickup-artist-explains/) and his review is virtually unreadable, unless you enjoy bird-brained sentences like this: 

<blockquote>Harry Potter was perhaps the first major shitlib touchstone to vault willing cuckoldry into the wider culture as some kind of moral imperative; it was beta orbiter Snape, a man with the worst case of oneitis imaginable because he was in love with a dead woman who when alive wanted nothing to do with him, who vowed to look after Harry, (the child of his oneitis by another man Snape hated), out of a misplaced sense of loyalty and maybe hope for an afterlife consummation.</blockquote>

* I'm sorry, but [a scratch-and-sniff book of marijuana](http://herald-review.com/entertainment/books-and-literature/scratch-and-sniff-book-on-pot-offers-education-with-a/article_87d9115a-5844-583f-a9f2-d436c95eca2d.html) sounds disgusting.
