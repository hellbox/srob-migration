Hunter S. Thompson's widow, Anita, just [returned a pair of antlers](http://brobible.com/life/article/ernest-hemingway-elk-antlers-hunter-s-thompson/) that Thompson stole from Ernest Hemingway's house about three years after Hemingway committed suicide. This story touches on so many high school boy writer wannabe zones of interest that it's not even funny: Thompson, Hemingway, theft, the ironic display of hunting trophies.

But let's be clear so all the wannabe gonzo journalists in the back can hear us: **stealing objects from the home of your idols is not okay**.Please don't walk into Thompson's house and try to steal his gong. You might get arrested, for one thing, and for another thing, the odds are good that even if you do get away with it, you're not going to have a widow as cool as Anita Thompson to do the right thing on your behalf after you're gone.
