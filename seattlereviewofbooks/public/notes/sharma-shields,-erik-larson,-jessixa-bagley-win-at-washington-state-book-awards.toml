Over the weekend, Spokane author Sharma Shields and Seattle authors Erik Larson and Jessixa Bagley won big at the Washington State Book Awards. St. Louis poet Carl Phillips, who was [born in Washington but has not lived in Washington state for decades](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/09/19/why-does-carl-phillips-need-the-washington-state-book-award/), also won. (Here's hoping the Washington Center for the Book at the Seattle Public Library updates the rules to ensure to favor Washington writers in the future.) [Moira Macdonald at the *Seattle Times*](http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/dead-wake-sasquatch-hunters-almanac-top-washington-state-book-awards/) has a list of all the winners.
