        <p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday May 4:  Writing for a Cause**</h5></p>
How do you write about politics and race and gender without being preachy? How do you bring passion to contemporary issues without overwhelming your reader? Former Seattle City Councilmember Nick Licata headlines a bill of writers not afraid to tell issues-based stories, including memoirist Elissa Washuta and poet Anastacia Tolbert. *Hugo House, 1634 11th Ave, 322-7030, http://hugohouse.org. . Free. All ages. 7:30 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday May 5: Neal Bascomb**</h5></p>
Neal Bascomb’s new book *The Hidden Fortress* is a non-fiction historical thriller about the plot to sabotage the Nazi quest for the atomic bomb. [Bascomb moved to Seattle late last year](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/_wh_previews/notes/49731c04-5959-8941-c3be-6aaa1b621892/) and is still getting to know the city; let’s be neighborly by supporting his excellent new book. *Hugo House, 1634 11th Ave, 322-7030, http://hugohouse.org. . Free. All ages. 7:30 p.m.  *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday May 6: Jack Straw Writers Series**</h5></p>
The first three Fridays of May, Jack Straw Productions presents local authors who have taken part in their annual Writers Program, which trains writers how to be better communicators.  Tonight’s readers include Robert Lashley and Shin Yu Pai, who are two of the most talented poets the Seattle area has to offer. *Jack Straw Cultural Center, 4261 Roosevelt Way NE, 634-0919. http://www.jackstraw.org/.$5. All ages. 7 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday May 7: Epilogue/Prologue**</h5></p>
See our Event of the Week column for more details. *Hugo House, 1634 11th Ave, 322-7030, http://hugohouse.org. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.* 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday May 8: Mother's Day Crafting Party**</h5></p>
Look, it’s okay that you didn’t get your mom something for Mother’s Day. But the least you can do is take her to this crafting party with Sewing Happiness author Sanae Ishida. You’ll make new memories with the woman who gave you life, and Ishida might read from her kids’ book about a ninja. It’s a win-win.  *Queen Anne Book Company, 1811 Queen Anne Ave N., 284-2427, http://qabookco.com. Free. All ages. 3 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday May 9: Todd Lockwood**</h5></p>
Nobody paints a goddamned dragon like Todd Lockwood. The badass fantasy cover artist, who, I would like to reiterate, *paints dragons for a living*, now makes the leap from painting covers of fantasy novels to the writers’ chair. His debut novel, *The Summer Dragon*, promises “an exciting new take on the dragon-riding genre.” Sold!
*University Book Store,  4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Tuesday May 10: David Rolf</strong></h5></p>
Not so long ago, conservatives mocked Seattle’s push for a $15 minimum wage. Now, California and New York are scrambling to follow our lead. Local SEIU president David Rolf presents <em>The Fight for Fifteen</em>, his account of how Seattle adopted $15, and his explanation why the rest of the country needs to catch the hell up.  <em>Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, <a href="http://townhallseattle.org">http://townhallseattle.org</a>. $5. All ages. 7 p.m.</em></p>
