        <p>Imagine a world in which booksellers can break into your home and steal back books that you bought from them. That, basically, is a reality with e-books. <a href="http://www.teleread.com/barnes-noble-stole-first-e-book-ever-bought/">Chris Meadows wrote for TeleRead</a> an account of how Barnes &amp; Noble &ldquo;stole&rdquo; the first e-book he ever bought. He even contacted Barnes &amp; Noble to complain, and they told him he could re-buy the e-book from them if he wanted. A couple days later, Barnes &amp; Noble <a href="http://www.teleread.com/barnes-noble-gives-first-e-book-back/">did decide to give Meadows back the e-book</a> that he purchased.  Awfully gracious of them.</p>

<p>Remember: <strong>you do not own the e-books that you buy</strong> from online retailers like Barnes &amp; Noble and Amazon. You license them, and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do if the publisher decides to take the book back from your online library.</p>

<p>In related news, if you don&rsquo;t update your old Kindles by tomorrow, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/20/11271880/amazon-kindle-emergency-update-unable-to-connect-at-this-time">they&rsquo;ll be disconnected from the internet</a>.</p>
