      <div class="content">
        <p><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/milo-yiannopoulos-strikes-250k-book-deal-959745">ran a gushing press release this morning</a> announcing Simon and Schuster&rsquo;s decision to publish Milo Yiannopoulos&rsquo;s memoir. Get a load of this swill:</p>

<blockquote>"I met with top execs at Simon & Schuster earlier in the year and spent half an hour trying to shock them with lewd jokes and outrageous opinions. I thought they were going to have me escorted from the building -- but instead they offered me a wheelbarrow full of money," Yiannopoulos told THR.</blockquote>

<p>Jesus, isn&rsquo;t it <em>boring</em>? Isn&rsquo;t that the most boring teenage bullshit you&rsquo;ve read in your life? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: Yiannopoulos is a white supremacist and a fascist. His beliefs are dangerous and he has been a cheerleader for society&rsquo;s villains for exactly as long as he&rsquo;s been on the world stage. We should not normalize his beliefs because they will, if unchecked, destroy society.</p>

<p>No, when I say Yiannopoulos is boring, I&rsquo;m talking about his schtick, the method through which he communicates his hate. Yiannopoulos fancies himself a shock-jock, a more political Andrew Dice Clay or Marilyn Manson for the 21st century. He thinks he&rsquo;s edgy, and he praises himself for promoting shock and outrage when really promoting shock and outrage is just about the easiest thing in the world to do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m already seeing calls to boycott Simon &amp; Schuster and I&rsquo;m already seeing Yiannopoulos supporters on Twitter cry censorship over those calls, even though <a href="https://xkcd.com/1357/">it&rsquo;s not censorship at all</a>. So let&rsquo;s lay it plain: <strong>Simon &amp; Schuster is most definitely paying a white supremacist and a fascist (albeit a boring one who fancies himself a provocateur) a quarter million dollars to write a book</strong>. There&rsquo;s no other way to put it.</p>
