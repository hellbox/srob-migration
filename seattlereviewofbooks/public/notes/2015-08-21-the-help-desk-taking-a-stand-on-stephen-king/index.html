        <p class="intro">*Every Friday, Cienna Madrid offers solutions to life’s most vexing literary problems. Do you need a book recommendation to send your worst cousin on her birthday? Is it okay to read erotica on public transit? Cienna can help. Send your questions to* advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p>

<p><strong>Can you just tell me, once and for all, if Stephen King is a good writer or not?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Dan, Belltown**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Dan,</p>

<p>My grandmother, a lovely woman named Roberta, used to ask me a question very similar to the one you pose. “Judy,” she’d say, because she loved to call both me and my mother, Evil Katy, by another woman’s name, “Judy, is that the phone?”</p>

<p>Roberta would ask this question at the doctor’s office, when a dog barked, during a moment of silence at a dear friend’s funeral — there was no inopportune time, in her opinion, to ask if there was a phone ringing somewhere.</p>

<p>Usually I could not hear a phone ringing but despite the silence I would often answer “Yes!” because I’m generally a positive person who prefers to speak in declarative affirmations (“The moon <em>absolutely</em> looks like a smug lesbian tonight,” or “Yes! I have forgotten your name again”).</p>

<p>On those occasions, Roberta heaved her 83-year-old frame out of her brocade recliner, pendulous breasts swinging like the excited wag of a dog’s tail as she shuffled into the kitchen to fondle the phone.</p>

<p>“God bless it, Judy, that wasn’t the phone,” she&rsquo;d then shout because she was deaf, not stupid. Nevertheless, she would return with a treat for me, like a string cheese or warm soda, because I was her favorite living granddaughter (sorry Good Katy, RIP Suzanne).</p>

<p>To answer your question: Stephen King is a good writer about as often as the phone is ringing.</p>

<p class="noindent">Hearts and butterflies,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
