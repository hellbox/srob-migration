* It's too late to attend the event discussed in [this South Seattle Emerald profile](https://southseattleemerald.com/2016/08/09/natasha-marin-brings-an-army-to-the-troll-fight/), but you should still read about Seattle poet Natasha Marin's Reparations project.

* This tweet from Books to Prisoners just won't get out of my head. Please support Books to Prisoners whenever you can; they do excellent work, and as you can see from this photo, they have to jump through some ridiculous hoops every day.
