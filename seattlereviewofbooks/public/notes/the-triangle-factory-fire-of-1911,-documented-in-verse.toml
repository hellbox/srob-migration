Our sponsor this week, Donald Kentop, became fascinated with the Triangle Factory Fire, after learning that the building where the tragedy happened still stands as the Asch Building. It's part of New York University, and Kentop had classes in the building when he was a student. 

He has woven a deep history of the fire, told in verse, through the stories of survivors, victims, and the unfolding of the event itself, in his book [_Frozen by Fire_](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships). The book, full of images and portraits, is a rich portrait of a tragedy the shaped American life. 

Kentop [will be appearing Sunday, November 15th](http://www.spl.org/audiences/adults/adu-calendar-of-events?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D116453669) to read from the work, at the Seattle Public Library's Ballard Branch.
