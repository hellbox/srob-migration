The only way out is not through (bone).<br>
When in doubt, don’t just meat or martyr.<br>
	
Before cutting off your hand to spite your captor, see if you can tip the jar. <br>
Sometimes, shoot it; when you do, aim for the gears.<br>

If there aren’t any scissors, start a fire. If there’s room in the well, sardine.<br>

Not every number is an incision, and not every rule is a law.<br>
The people who call you imprisoned are begging dilemma, so recognize<br>
when dismantling traps requires you to think like a needle<br>
and when you’d be better off thread.

Think outside the bear trap: Cinderella would smash her glass slipper<br>
and birdsong a key from the shards; James Bond martini a fast car<br>
from razor wire and the last olive. Joan of Arc would put on the wrong clothes,<br>
take her own advice, call it God; there’s an exit for you. I promise.
