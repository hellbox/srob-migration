The book in question is [*I Am Jazz*, written by Jessica Herthel and Jazz Jennings, and illustrated by Shelagh McNicholas](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780803741072). These bigoted parents need to understand that **banning a book never works**; it only results in more copies sold and increased interest. A few more of these moronic attempts to ban the book from the public conversation will likely result in *I Am Jazz* landing on the bestseller list, where it belongs.
