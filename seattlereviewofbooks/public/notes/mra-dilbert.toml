Did you know that Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, is a real dillhole? It's true! And the Tumblr [MRA Dilbert](http://mradilbert.tumblr.com/?og=1) performs a real public service by publishing Scott Adams's actual words in the word balloons of his characters. This is such a clever way to comment on Adams' toxic beliefs. Contrasting them with the bland inoccuousness of his cartoons — although calling Adams's drawing "cartoons" feels like an insult to cartooning — lays all the ugliness of his ideas and work out for anyone to see.
