* Congratulations to Sherman Alexie, who is this year's Pierce County Library system selection for [Pierce County Reads](http://www.blscourierherald.com/news/368092381.html). The library chose five of Alexie's books for everyone in Pierce County to read. They are: *The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven*, *Reservation Blues*, *Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian*, *Flight*, and *War Dances*. I wholeheartedly agree; everyone in Washington state should read all of those books.

* Seattle Arts and Lectures is [hiring a Program Associate](http://www.lectures.org/about_us/opportunities.php?id=26) for its Writers in the Schools program. If you support writing education for kids, this might be the job for you.

* The lineup for the third Rainier Valley Lit Crawl [has been announced](http://gregbem.com/wordpress/2016/02/09/upcoming-event-rainier-valley-lit-crawl-3/). This one happens on March 5th. Start getting excited. One of the readings will happen at the Peruvian chicken joint Big Chickie, which surely represents some kind of a first in Seattle literary history.

* Nationally, the book Twittersphere is very excited that Lisa Lucas, the former publisher of *Guernica*, [has just been named the third Executive Director](http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/lisa-lucas-named-executive-director-of-national-book-foundation/?_r=0) of the National Book Foundation, which oversees the National Book Awards.

* *Selma* director Ava DuVernay is [being pursued](http://collider.com/ava-duvernay-a-wrinkle-in-time-movie-intelligent-life/) to direct a film adaptation of *A Wrinkle in Time*. I would watch the hell out of that.

* In the face of a consumer revolt, Amazon has [changed the weight of a Helvetica font](http://www.teleread.com/amazon/amazon-rolling-back-evil-font-change-kindle-update-thanks/) on its Kindle e-readers. Readers weren't happy when Amazon swapped out the font for a lighter version.
