<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>The other day at the eye doctor’s office, I found myself considering a pince nez. Would this make me look like a total ass, or is it time for FDR’s preferred eyewear to make a comeback?</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>Stu, Bellevue</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Stu,</p>

<p class="noindent">There are two instances in which I could see this look working on a contemporary face: if you were to pair your prince nez with a reptile contact lens, so that you had one large, freaky snake eye, or if you were to poke your non-prince nez eye out with a fork. All other alternatives are unacceptable.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,<br>
<p class="noindent">Cienna

<p class="noindent">P.S. Speaking of lenses and history and such, go read [*Short Nights of the Shadow Catcher*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780544102767).</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>Settle a bet: is there ever a time when plagiarism is morally justified?</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>Evie, Port Townsend</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Evie,</p>

<p class="noindent">Considering that I have used stories of my alcoholic father's suicide to score free drinks in bars, take my views on morality with as much salt as you wish: No, plagiarism is never morally justified.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,<br>
<p class="noindent">Cienna

<p class="noindent">P.S. Speaking of immorality, go read [*Insane Clown President*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399592461).</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>I just want to know more about the spiders, please. The way you talk about them makes my stomach feel funny, and I’m not sure yet if it’s good or bad.
 </strong></p>
 

<p class="noindent"><strong>Shelob, Pioneer Square</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Shelob,</p>

<p class="noindent">Did you know that female black widows can store sperm in their abdomens for up to two years? Or that spider blood is blue? Or that their silk is five times stronger than steel – in fact, it's so strong and elastic that scientists cannot replicate it? </p>

<p>Or that the two things you never, ever want to do on a Friday night with your spider friends is draw a bubble bath or play &ldquo;light as a feather, stiff as a board&rdquo; because both will end in horror?</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses!<br>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>

<p class="noindent">P.S. Go read [*The Private Life of Spiders*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780691150031).</p>
