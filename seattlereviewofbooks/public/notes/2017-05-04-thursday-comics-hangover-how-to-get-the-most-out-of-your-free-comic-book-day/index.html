        <p>Ordinarily, I use this space to write about the comics that I&rsquo;ve read over the past week. But this Saturday is Free Comic Book Day — that nationwide celebration of the belief that there&rsquo;s a comic out there for everyone — and so we&rsquo;re going to look forward for a change. If you&rsquo;ve never participated before, you should know that it&rsquo;s pretty simple: walk into the store, get some comics for free. If you have questions, ask the staff.</p>

<p><strong>Where should you go?</strong> Well, <a href="http://www.freecomicbookday.com/">there&rsquo;s a map of all the participating shops here</a>. But a lot of local stores are throwing special events, too. A partial list:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Comics Dungeon in Wallingford</strong> will be hosting local cartoonists all day. <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/05/01/how-to-celebrate-free-comic-book-day-and-promote-literacy-at-the-same-time/">I spoke with the Dungeon&rsquo;s owner Scott Tomlin about his plans</a> — and the exciting new literacy nonprofit behind his shop — <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/05/01/how-to-celebrate-free-comic-book-day-and-promote-literacy-at-the-same-time/">earlier this week</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>From 11 am to 3 pm, <a href="http://phoenixseattle.com/free-comic-book-day-2017/"><strong>Phoenix Comics and Games</strong> on Broadway</a> will host Seattle comics writer G. Willow Wilson — who was recently <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/g-willow-wilsons-american-heroes">the subject of a terrific <em>New Yorker</em> profile</a> and the driving force behind <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/vox/the-ezra-klein-show/e/g-willow-wilson-on-religion-comics-and-modern-myths-49722931">a very good conversation about faith on the <em>Ezra Klein Show</em></a> —  along with cartoonist Kazu Kibuishi and author/translator Zack Davisson.</p></li>

<li><p>Downtown&rsquo;s <strong>Zanadu Comics</strong> is <a href="http://www.zanaducomics.com/free-comic-book-day/">throwing a big sale</a> and handing out special coupons all day long. If you regularly buy comics in Seattle, you should stop by Zanadu and buy a comic or two; the store has recently fallen on tough financial times and they&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://www.zanaducomics.com/gofundme">running a GoFundMe</a> to stay afloat. They&rsquo;ve still got some of the best selection in town, and they could use a little love.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Arcane Comics</strong>, which last year moved just across the Seattle border to Shoreline, is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/736226343217519/">hosting local cartoonists Jen Vaughn, Chris Sheridan, and Tatiana Gill</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>There are plenty of other shops, too, including Fremont&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.outsidercomics.com/">Outsider Comics &amp; Geek Boutique</a>, the <a href="http://fantagraphics.com/flog/whats-store-comic-book-day/">Fantagraphics Bookstore &amp; Gallery</a> in Georgetown, <a href="http://www.dreamstrands.com/freecomicday.html">Dreamstrands Comics &amp; Collectibles</a> in Greenwood, <a href="http://www.goldenagecollectables.com/">Golden Age Collectibles</a> in the Pike Place Market (which I just now learned from their website claims to be America&rsquo;s oldest comics shop,) and <a href="http://www.dreamingcomics.com/">The Dreaming Comics &amp; Games</a> in the U District.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And <strong>what should you pick up?</strong> Well, you can <a href="http://www.freecomicbookday.com/catalog">find a full list of the Free Comic Book Day books here</a>, and there&rsquo;s something for most everyone&rsquo;s taste. But here are a couple to look out for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Obviously, you should read the Fantagraphics collection <a href="http://www.freecomicbookday.com/Catalog/JAN170028"><em>World&rsquo;s Greatest Cartoonists</em></a>, which features a bunch of artists from the Fantagraphics stable including Emil Ferris, Noah Van Sciver, and Simon Hanselmann.</p></li>

<li><p>If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with the weird and wonderful collaborations between French cartoonist Moebius and the great director Alejandro Jodorowsky, <a href="http://www.freecomicbookday.com/Catalog/JAN170031">this sampler of their comic <em>The Incal</em></a> should definitely be on your list.</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="http://www.freecomicbookday.com/Catalog/JAN170024"><em>Colorful Monsters</em> collection</a> has just about everything a kid could want, including some Moomin comics, monsters, and hot air balloons.</p></li>

<li><p>Cartoonist Kate Beaton loves the all-ages comic <em>Bad Machinery</em>, and <a href="http://www.freecomicbookday.com/Catalog/JAN170039">this sampler</a> is a good introduction to the series, about some young crime-solvers. In this caper, they encounter Communists and a very anachronistic person.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Have fun out there! Stay hydrated, get some free comics, maybe buy a comic or two, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/seattlereviewof/">follow along with us on Instagram</a> as we travel around to some of our favorite shops.</p>
