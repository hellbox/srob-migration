        <p>We at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> aren&rsquo;t attending the Association of Writers &amp; Writing Programs (AWP) conference in Washington DC, but we&rsquo;ve been following along on social media as the Seattle contingent of attendees represents us in readings and at conferences. They&rsquo;re doing us proud!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, AWP management doesn&rsquo;t seem to be rising to the occasion. We&rsquo;ve seen several Facebook posts complaining about a failure to provide accessibility for the disabled, particularly with power doors onsite at the Washington [DC] Convention Center that don&rsquo;t open at the push of a button. (<a href="https://adac.wisc.edu/ada-conference-planning-guidelines.htm">Here are the ADA&rsquo;s conference planning guidelines</a> and <a href="http://www.cct.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/RenewingADACommitment_0211.pdf">here&rsquo;s an ADA compliance guide for nonprofits</a>.) One writer complained to AWP management that the accessibility desk was not accessible; they say they were told to bring their complaint to the accessibility desk.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.mhpbooks.com/i-question-your-commitment-to-books-awp-staff-battle-seattle-tax-law-social-media-response-even-a-reporter/">learned from personal experience</a> that AWP responds best to public pressure. So if you&rsquo;re at AWP — or if you&rsquo;re a literary-minded person who expects a major conference to treat all its guests with fairness and inclusivity — I urge you to read the wonderful Facebook post below and contact AWP management to let them know that this behavior is unacceptable.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Wow. AWP&rsquo;s response to one Twitter complaint is wholly unacceptable:</p>
