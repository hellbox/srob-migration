<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Nerve Endings: The New Trans Erotic_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tobitastic/nerve-endings-the-new-trans-erotic?ref=category_location). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Tobi Hill-Meyer](http://tobihillmeyer.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
Thirty stories about sex, sexuality, and relationships, by authors connected to transgender community.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>
    

<p class="noindent">
This project's creator, Tobi Hill-Meyer, has <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/10/28/what-you-missed-at-lit-crawl-while-you-were-busy-attending-lit-crawl/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - What you missed at Lit Crawl while you were busy attending Lit Crawl">appeared on our site before</a>. She's taking a pro-active approach to an issue she puts this way: "Too often trans stories have been written from a cis perspective, with a cis reader in mind, addressing cis concerns about trans people rather than our own concerns. This is especially true when it comes to erotica: literature that deals necessarily with bodies, with our relationships to them, and with our relationships to one another."
</p>

<p>Since the trans community is largely commodified by the larger porn world, being able to tell their own stories in their own way is a pretty important idea. Again, in Hill-Meyer&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;So much of the hostility and bigotry trans people face is focused around sexuality: anti-trans bathroom bills conjure fears of &ldquo;perverts,&rdquo; straight men frame trans women as &ldquo;deceptive.&rdquo; Others see us as hypersexual and expect us to be available for sex practically on demand, and doctors have historically denied access to hormones and surgery to those who don&rsquo;t have the &ldquo;right&rdquo; kind of sex.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
At this point, with the project already well-backed, it's about the stretch goals. For each one, the contributor's payment goes up. A nice feel-good bonus. It also seems like a fantastic, well-thought out anthology, both for trans people looking for better representation in their dirty stories, and for people looking to find out more about the experiences and challenges of being trans. 
</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
    13 days to go, and 257% funded! They're totally killing it.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
