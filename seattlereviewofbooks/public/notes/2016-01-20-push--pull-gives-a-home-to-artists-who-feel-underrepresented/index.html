<p>Maxx Follis originally created the space that would become Push/Pull at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/echoechogallery/">Echo Echo</a>, a collective gallery in Greenwood. She always intended for Push/Pull to be a cooperative space with artists acting as members, but her first call for members only delivered one artist — cartoonist Seth Goodkind. “So when it started out it was just the two of us trying to fill four walls of art” every month or so for a new show, she explains.</p>

<p>Soon, Follis and Goodkind realized that they needed to build a community if they wanted their gallery to take off, because “we couldn’t just make art all the time.” She pauses and corrects herself. “We couldn’t make <em>good</em> art all the time. You can make art all the time,” she says, but if all you’re doing is running on a treadmill, you begin to sacrifice quality at the altar of quantity.</p>

<p>After a long search for space and a successful Kickstarter, Push/Pull opened two months ago in <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/13/the-many-sides-of-pushpull-our-bookstore-of-the-month/">their new home at 5484 Shilshole Ave NW</a> with seven contributing artists as members. (“I’m almost done sending out all of the [Kickstarter] rewards,” Follis tells me. How was crowdfunding for her?  “It was totally crazy and I wouldn’t recommend it to, really, anyone, but I definitely think I would do it again.”) Over the course of the space’s development, Follis says, “comics became one of our main focuses.”</p>

<p>Push/Pull is much more illustration-centric than most of the galleries in town, which focus more on so-called “fine art.” Follis says there’s a definite prejudice in the art world against illustration; “fine artists don’t realize how much work goes into drawing,” she says.</p>

<p>And now as illustrators come to Push/Pull events and start to hang out with cartoonists, Follis says, the lines between those disciplines are blurring. “It’s funny how many [illustrators] don’t do comics and then they start to hang around with these cartoonists and all of a sudden they’ll come out with a mini[comic].” She says people who have only drawn static illustrations are starting to think to themselves: “I can do something more than just make a piece. I can create a story.”</p>

<p>The work ethic of cartooning plays right into Push/Pull’s aesthetic theory of abundance. “The reason that the artist/illustrator/cartoonist tends to be a good fit for us,” Follis says, “is that people who do comics are compelled to tell stories, so they already have a drive and they tend to work well for us because they want to make art all the time.”</p>

<p>All of the art and comics at Push/Pull are sold on commission, and Follis claims that they offer some of the best rates in town — the artists keep 75 percent of sales. Push/Pull pays regularly, too, which leaves some cartoonists in a state of shock. They’re treating artists who generally don’t enjoy a whole lot of respect as professionals who are worthy of attention.</p>

<p>“We have artists that specifically come to us because no other gallery in Seattle will show them,” Follis says. “And we like that.”</p>
