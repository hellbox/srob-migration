I hope you're keeping up on the Phinney Books [Resist List](http://www.phinneybooks.com/resist-list/), a regularly updated list of civically minded books for sale through their website and in their store. Twenty percent of all Resist List sales will benefit the ACLU. This is the sort of thing that independent bookstores are great at, and it's another way to stay involved in a time when every day brings with it a series of new political horrors.
