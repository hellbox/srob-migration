        <div class="content">
          A couple months ago, the APRIL Festival announced a writing contest, with the winner receiving $100, the publication of their piece right here on the Seattle Review of Books, and a reading slot in the 2016 festival.
Today, APRIL announced that the winner of their contest is Jessica Mooney, who you can follow on Twitter right now. SRoB cofounder Martin McClellan and I chose the winning entry, and it took a lot of deliberation.

        <div class="content">
          Brian Tashman at Right Wing Watch says:
In a meeting with *The Des Moines Register*’s editorial board today, Ben Carson defended his proposal to crack down on political bias on college campuses by saying that the Department of Education should have the power to **secretly monitor classrooms and libraries** to root out and uncover potential bias. I&rsquo;ll just come out and say this: if you believe the government should be spying on libraries and classrooms and other places where books and reading are sacrosanct, you are an enemy of America.

        <div class="content">
          Since our launch week, we've been wrapping up Rahawa Haile's Short Story of the Day project every Saturday. Now that the project is ended, she was nice enough to sit down with us and talk about it. Look for a new thing for us, coming this Saturday.
You’ve been working on this a year now.
-ish, yeah.
When did you start, exactly?
I started January 1st.  So you did start January 1st, so it’s *almost* a full year.

        <div class="content">
          This, from the Office of Arts and Culture, is pretty damn cool:
The Seattle Office of Arts & Culture,(ARTS) in partnership with Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) seeks a practicing, published poet, fiction, or creative non-fiction writer for a unique project-based **artist residency in the northwest tower of the Fremont Bridge**. The selected writer will undertake an in-depth exploration of the bridge and write a piece in response to the experience.

        <div class="content">
          Our January bookstore of the month is Ballard’s own Push/Pull Art &amp; Illustration Studio &amp; Gallery, a cooperative space that launched out of a successful Kickstarter campaign last summer. Push/Pull is a gallery space devoted to art and comics and it’s also an underground comics store, with roughly 60 titles, and many more on the way. (You can see a small collection of the zines and comics, including one titled Those Fucking Dinosaurs, on their retail site.

        <div class="content">
          This morning, the comics internet blew up when the long list for this year&rsquo;s prestigious French comics award, the Grand Prix d’Angouleme, was announced. The list of 30 candidates did not include one single female cartoonist. And in case your first instinct was to mansplain this fact away — &rdquo;durr, but maybe no woman produced a comic worthy of awards this year,&rdquo; I can hear the gamergate crowd grumbling, as though that made any sense at all — you should bear in mind that in the Grand Prix&rsquo;s 43 years, only one woman has ever won the award.

        <div class="content">
          As you likely already know, the Hugo House building will be torn down this spring and a six-story mixed-use development will be built on the site. The Hugo House is scheduled to reopen in the new building sometime in 2018. (Mary Ann Gwinn published a preview of the new House in the Seattle Times last week.) But until today, we didn’t know where the House would be operating during the interim.

          Long shot prairie
Long shot wolf
Long shot girl
Long shot deer
Long shot dog
Close-up shot little monkey
My dear sweetheart,
Where does the North begin?
Wolfang, Fang, Flash and Flame
My darling cotton wooly hotel
A tiny house is expensive
At the edge of the sea
What is happiness, Love?
My dear sweetheart&mdash;

          Heading east for the American Library Association Midwinter meeting in Boston? Are you interested in the future of books and reading? Check out the CODEX hackathon over at the MIT Media Lab January 8-10.
The concept of a hackathon may seem daunting if you&rsquo;re not a developer or designer, but really, don&rsquo;t be intimidated. Typically, small groups of people are put together to work a problem, or respond to a conceptual prompt.
