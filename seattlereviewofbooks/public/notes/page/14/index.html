Dear Cienna,
I work at a large independent bookstore. I love my job, but my manager is getting on my nerves — specifically, his tendency to smack-talk Amazon to customers.

Last night I decided to go to the movies for the simple reason that after a week of relentless breaking news stories about Donald Trump, two hours in a dark room with my phone turned off sounded like some kind of paradise. I decided to go to an opening night screening of Alien: Covenant. It was a pretty film, and Michael Fassbender turns in an excellent performance, but the movie was ultimately pretty bad — it was a horror movie that forgot to be scary, a philosophical movie that wasn&rsquo;t very smart to begin with, a space exploration movie with no joy to it.

        <div class="content">
          I haven’t had much to say about superhero movies lately — sorry, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, it’s not you, it’s me — but I do agree with the consensus that the movies made from DC Comics superheroes have been disastrous. Batman V Superman was one of the worst blockbusters I’ve ever seen. Suicide Squad was even worse. I’ll be watching the Wonder Woman movie when it debuts at Cinerama in a couple of weeks, but that feels more like an act of obligation: I want to support the first female superhero movie in a generation, even though Gal Gadot has never once ever successfully, in the technical sense of the word, acted.

Something very strange happens when you get a bunch of book people — booksellers and librarians, say — to sit down at a bar with a bunch of people who work with movies, like projectionists and film bookers. Usually, all the book people want to talk about is movies: what’s coming out, what this movie star was like when she visited town for a special screening, what working at a movie theater is like.

        <div class="content">
          Seattle novelist Matt Ruff&rsquo;s excellent novel Lovecraft Country started its life as a pitch for a television show. Now, the Hollywood Reporter says the cycle is complete, as Lovecraft Country (the novel) is heading to HBO. And Get Out director Jordan Peele is producing it, along with J.J. Abrams&rsquo; Bad Robot production company:
The drama — described as an anthological horror series that reclaims genre storytelling from the African-American perspective — hails from Peele's Monkeypaw Productions, as well as Bad Robot and Warner Bros.
