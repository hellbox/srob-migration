        <div class="content">
          This morning, Pioneer Square&rsquo;s Seattle Mystery Bookshop launched a GoFundMe campaign &ldquo;to make sure the rent is completely paid off, all our suppliers are happy, and to restore missing titles and depleted series to our shelves.&rdquo; Their goal is to raise $50,000. Rewards for the campaign include signed first editions, a noirish 1974 Michael Garmin sculpture, tote bags, and coffee cups.
If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about what makes Seattle Mystery Bookshop so great, we have a whole series of pieces explaining just that — they were our Bookstore of the Month back in September.

Originally from Gorham, Maine — coincidentally, one town over from my native Buxton — poet Greg Bem moved to Seattle and immediately started building a community of artists and writers. He’s thrown a bunch of events all around town (you’ll read more about those in a second) and his passion for intelligent, challenging work has improved the quality of discourse in Seattle’s art scene. Bem’s newest project is a weeklong series of free readings at Seattle Center titled [Ghost Tokens: Inumbrating Pinnacle](http://gregbem.

          Now that Mein Kampf is back in the headlines — thanks a lot, Germany — Adam Gopnik reviews the book for The New Yorker.
...the striking thing about the text as a text is that it is not so much diabolical or sinister as *creepy*. It is the last book in the world that you would expect a nascent Fascist dictator to write... Hitler, whom we suspect of being an embittered, envious, traumatized loser, presents himself as .

        <div class="content">
          Yesterday saw the publication of the ninth and final issue of Jonathan Hickman and Esad Ribic&rsquo;s Marvel Comics mega-crossover event, Secret Wars. The series, which works as both a remake of Marvel&rsquo;s 1984 crossover comic of the same name and a reboot of the entire line of Marvel&rsquo;s superhero comics, has been huge and goofy and fun.
You can&rsquo;t really explain Secret Wars to someone who has no prior experience with Marvel Comics.

        <div class="content">
          The Arkansas-born poet who published with Copper Canyon Press died unexpectedly and Rich Smith, and there will undoubtedly be more in the days and weeks ahead.
For right now, I&rsquo;d like to send your attention to a recording of Wright reading her own poem &ldquo;Everything Good Between Men and Women&rdquo; at the Poetry Foundation. It&rsquo;s a loud, lively, even raucous poem that starts with a bang (the title flows dircectly into the opening lines, &ldquo;has been written in mud and butter/and barbecue sauce&rdquo;) and concludes with a demand for the reader to &ldquo;Call it a night.

          Remember when I told you that Mein Kampf was about to be published in Germany again for the first time since World War II? Yeah, it sold out in less than a week. This is not the ending to this story that I was hoping for.
(Vaguely related: one time back in my bookselling days, a customer tried to return a copy of Mein Kampf because it was an &ldquo;inferior text.

        <div class="content">
          An anonymous Seattle apartment building owner is running an essay contest. The winner gets to live rent-free in a &ldquo;clean, comfortable place&rdquo; in Queen Anne or Ballard for a year. The essays are supposed to respond to the question &ldquo;How would a free apartment for one year help you reach your goals in 10 years?&rdquo; in 350 words or less. You can&rsquo;t solve gentrification with a writing contest, but at least the odds are better than Powerball.

Last week, I erroneously referred to this month’s Bookstore of the Month as Push/Pull Gallery. That&rsquo;s my mistake; it’s just Push/Pull. There’s a reason why founder Maxx Follis decided to drop the descriptors from the name — it’s because the space performs many functions at the same time. Yes, it’s a gallery. And yes, it’s a bookstore providing one of the biggest selections of small press comics in the city.
