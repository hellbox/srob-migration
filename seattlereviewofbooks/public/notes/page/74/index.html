        <div class="content">
          Louis Collins has been selling used books out of a storefront on Capitol Hill since 1984. It’s easy to miss — Louis Collins Books is a squat building at the corner of 12th and Denny, with nothing but a small white sign to identify it. Though Collins comes in to the store nearly every afternoon, the store is only open by appointment, so you can’t just wander in and check out the shelves of books visible from the street.

          My Son, the Prince of Fashion What a wonderful piece by Michael Chabon on his son Abe, and his love of fashion. This is one you want to stay around for the ending, but I found the whole thing so charming, honest, and beautifully written that reaching the end was no issue at all.
 Abe was just a kid who loved clothes. He loved talking about them, looking at them, and wearing them, and when it came to men's clothing, in particular the hipper precincts of streetwear, he knew his shit.

          Every week, the _Seattle Review of Books_ backs a Kickstarter, and writes up why we picked that particular project. Read more about the project here. Suggest a project by writing to _kickstarter_ at this domain, or by using our contact form. **What's the project this week**?
[_Denise Levertov Plaque_](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/denise-levertov-plaque-poetry). We've put $60 in as a non-reward backer &mdash; that's our normal $20, plus $40 from the fund for the two unsuccessful projects we've backed that we decided to put towards this campaign.

          Michael Schaub writes a very appropriate Banned Books Week story for the L.A. Times&rsquo;s Jacket Copy blog:
If you're one of the more than 140,000 people doing time in a Texas state prison, you're not allowed to read books by Bob Dole, Harriet Beecher Stowe or Sojourner Truth. But you're more than welcome to dig into Adolf Hitler's "Mein Kampf" or David Duke's "My Awakening." If this story makes you mad, maybe consider donating to Seattle-based nonprofit Books to Prisoners?

Yesterday, I told you that In Other Words, the feminist bookstore featured in the TV show Portlandia under the fictional name Women &amp; Women First, had put a &ldquo;Fuck Portlandia&rdquo; sign in its window, and when the Willamette Week reached out for comment, bookstore staff told the Week to &ldquo;go fuck themselves.&rdquo;
Now, In Other Words has written a post explaining the sign. Also titled &ldquo;Fuck Portlandia,&rdquo; the post makes a great case for why In Other Words doesn&rsquo;t want to play by the show&rsquo;s rules anymore:

Dear Cienna,
**I wanted my son to be a nerd. I introduced him to *A Wrinkle in Time* and the Narnia series probably way too early, and I’m happy to report that it stuck: when it comes to books, he loves everything nerdy.

Thursday September 29th: Writing for a Cause
At a time when Donald Trump can block newspapers he doesn’t like from covering his campaign, this is more relevant than ever: Journalists Muatasim Qazi, Frederica Jansz, and former Seattle PI reporter Mike Lewis will discuss censorship. Jansz and Qazi both came to US after facing censorship abroad, only to find new threats here.

          The Short Run Comix and Arts Festival has unveiled their schedule of events, and it&rsquo;s a doozy. It begins next week at Elliott Bay Book Company with the launch party for Seattle cartoonist Sarah Glidden&rsquo;s brand-new book Rolling Blackouts. I&rsquo;ll be interviewing Glidden onstage about her book, which documents Glidden&rsquo;s travels through Turkey, Syria, and Iraq with several reporters from the Seattle Globalist. I hope to see you at Elliott Bay next week, and I hope you&rsquo;ll consider attending all the Short Run events over the next two months.

          I agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that Jonathan Hickman’s series Secret Wars was a high point for Marvel Comics — it was the culmination of a time in which Marvel seemed to be doing new things with its superhero comics, exploring old concepts with fresh eyes. At roughly this time last year, Marvel Comics felt as though it was humming with possibility; as Marvel&rsquo;s films came to dominate the blockbuster box office, the comics division seemed ready to move forward into a new age.
