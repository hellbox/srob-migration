        <div class="content">
          Italian news sources are reporting that author Umberto Eco has passed away. He turned 84 years old last month. Eco is the author of two global bestsellers: Foucault&rsquo;s Pendulum, a playful conspiracy thriller; and The Name of the Rose, a murder mystery set in a Benedictine monastery. I especially enjoyed Eco&rsquo;s underrated 2004 novel The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, a deeply personal tribute to the comics and pulp literature of Eco&rsquo;s youth, as well as a rumination on memory and aging.

        <div class="content">
          Alex Balk at The Awl published a brief post against longform nonfiction storytelling. Here&rsquo;s a quote from the piece, which I think gets the point across with even more brevity: &ldquo;Are there some stories so intricate that they actually demand tens of thousands of words to tell them? Sure. Maybe six or seven a year. Everything else you read is padding or awards-bait.&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s purposefully incendiary stuff, and obviously a broad generalization.

I absolutely love Tintin. I have since I was a kid, and still just fall for his outrageous antics. But oh my god, is it racist.

          The author of To Kill a Mockingbird — and, so far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the author of only To Kill a Mockingbird — has died at age 89.
Those who believe the Great American Novel is a singular experience have it wrong; there are many Great American Novels, each a timeless snapshot of a particular moment in American history. Of that tradition of Great American Novels, To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the very best, because it delivered the America that we all — Northern or Southern, black or white, woman or man — aspire to create.

Christine Marie Larsen is off for the next few weeks, no doubt hand-assembling brushes from rarified animal hairs, gathering pigment from the mineraled rocks atop the highest peaks, and making paper from the miraculous cotton rags used to clean the paintings of the old masters in the Louvre.
In her absence, you can always see her work in our archive of the Portrait Gallery. She&rsquo;ll see you all in a few weeks.

Seattle author Matt Ruff’s new novel [*Lovecraft Country*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/caught-after-dark-in-lovecraft-country/) is a thoughtful, rewarding examination of the connection between genre and American racism. Specifically, it’s a story that juxtaposes America’s shameful history of systemic racism with the racist history of American science fiction. While the former is well-documented, sci-fi’s racist past is much less overt.
The pivot-point for the novel is arguably the most famous racist in American literary history: HP Lovecraft, the cult horror writer who was an unabashed white supremacist.

        <div class="content">
          If you were to ask me to nominate one cartoonist to create a comic book adaptation of a Todd Solondz film, I would, without a second thought, choose Nick Drnaso. Like Solondz&rsquo;s films, the world in Drnaso’s new collection Beverly is ugly and mundane; unattractive Americans live their boring lives in bland surroundings — cut-rate hotel rooms, tract housing. Drnaso draws his figures with simple lines, often at the middle distance.

          We here at the Seattle Review of Books are incredibly excited for Link Light Rail to open to Capitol Hill and the University District. (Fun fact: light rail opens on the exact same weekend as the APRIL Festival&rsquo;s big book fair at the Hugo House! That&rsquo;s your Sunday, March 20th all sorted for you.) And this video from Sound Transit profiling Seattle cartoonist Ellen Forney is only getting us more excited about launch-day, especially because it&rsquo;s got plenty of footage of the installation of Forney&rsquo;s beautiful illustrations of giant hands in the Capitol Hill station.
