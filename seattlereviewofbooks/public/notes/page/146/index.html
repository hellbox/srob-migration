          disturbed bodies
(ours)
and on the other side
a moon
possibly&hellip;
watching
 switching pens there
subtle hope
&amp; your tired body
tired
breathing hard&hellip;
to exist
 My minor violence
Toward the gazelle
Is unforgivable
Now making lists
Of the longing that will stay&hellip;
And the longing that
Will be fixed in images
Hatred splits us
But its necessity
Is like water
And love

        <div class="content">
          Dalya Alberge writes at The Guardian that a recently uncovered manuscript co-authored by Orson Welles reveals some truths about the friendship between Ernest Hemingway and Welles:
The manuscript, presented in a new study on Welles, reflects his disdain for a type of macho tourist frequently spotted in Spain when mass travel to the country took off in the 1960s. Intended to form the basis of of a love-triangle drama, the script features an American bullfighting aficionado, clearly inspired by Hemingway, as the lead character.

MONDAY Your week in readings begins at Seattle Center&rsquo;s Artists at Play Playground at 9 pm tonight. Seattle poet Arlo Smith reads as part of the Inumbrating Pinnacle reading series, which continues all week long, culminating on Saturday night. If you haven’t been to this playground, you should most definitely go just for the spectacle of it; it’s unbelievably cool.
TUESDAY Wage Slaves, the work-themed reading series featuring free donuts, happens tonight at the Hugo House.

          [How Could The Winds of Winter Be Published In Only Three Months?](http://www.tor.com/2016/01/13/winds-of-winter-book-publishing-process/) If you&rsquo;re curious about how a book is made in our modern world, Tor took a detailed look. They were inspired by George R.R. Martin&rsquo;s letter to fans explaining why his manuscript - Not A Blog&rdquo;) for the next chapter in his Westeros saga wasn&rsquo;t going to be ready by deadline. He made the startling claim that if he had the manuscript done by the end of the year, the publishers were going to have the book ready by the end of March.

        <div class="content">
          The music is terrible, the presentation glib, and the $400 only accounts for mininum-wage labor, not materials (like the cost of the animals slaughtered).
But, this video is valuable for showing just what goes into making the materials of a very rustic book. Making a refined book is only easy due to the scale of industry.
Watching this reminds me that books are a technology, and like any technology, the methods of production have been perfected over time, until books became so ubiquitous that the process of making them completely dissapeared, and all we are left to think about is the content inside of them.
