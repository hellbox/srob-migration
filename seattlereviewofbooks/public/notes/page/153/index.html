        <div class="content">
          Did you know that Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, is a real dillhole? It&rsquo;s true! And the Tumblr MRA Dilbert performs a real public service by publishing Scott Adams&rsquo;s actual words in the word balloons of his characters. This is such a clever way to comment on Adams&rsquo; toxic beliefs. Contrasting them with the bland inoccuousness of his cartoons — although calling Adams&rsquo;s drawing &ldquo;cartoons&rdquo; feels like an insult to cartooning — lays all the ugliness of his ideas and work out for anyone to see.

          Elliott Bay Book Company event coordinator Rick Simonson first met Barbara Abdeni Massaad when she was in Seattle to help Wassef Haroun prepare to open the restaurant that would eventually become Mamnoon. The Mamnoon crew would meet for planning sessions over coffee in Elliott Bay’s cafe, and eventually they came to be fixtures at the bookstore. Massaad even attended Elliott Bay’s exclusive, invite-only 40th anniversary party — “she had come farther than anyone for our party, from Beirut,” Simonson recalls.

          [Men Explain Lolita To Me](http://lithub.com/men-explain-lolita-to-me/) Rebecca Solnit, after writing a piece mocking Esquire&rsquo;s infamous &ldquo;80 Books Every Man Should Read&rdquo;, got things explained to her by white men. Thankfully, she&rsquo;s wonderful at explaining things back. It was hard to find a quote from this essay to pull here, since there were many paragraphs I wanted to quote, but this one in particular I found very affecting:
 There is a common attack on art that thinks it is a defense.

We really loved Babb&rsquo;s direct, lyrical prose, and think you will too. We have two pieces from the book on the sponsor page for you to read. Make sure to do so before Sunday!

Since Rahawa is ending this project at the end of the year, this is the third-to-last posting of our wrap-up. Two more to go, and then we launch something new on Saturdays, starting January 10th.
