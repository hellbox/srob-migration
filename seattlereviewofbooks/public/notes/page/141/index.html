          The headline of this post is the motto of Editions at Play, a new digital bookstore teamup between London publisher Visual Editions and Google. According to Emiko Jozuka at Motherboard, the digital books are crosses between books, movies, and video games.
“We wanted to think about what we could do online that we couldn’t do in print. How could we make books that still feel bookish—so they are books that you would read— but that you could experience as well given they are visual,” Anna Gerber, the co-creative director for Editions at Play, told me over the phone.

        <div class="content">
          Cecilia Woloch, whose most recent poetry collection was from Washington publisher Two Sylvias Press, has a wonderful poem in the New York Times today. &ldquo;Wild Common Prayer&rdquo; is a poem with long, luxurious lines about an encounter with a familiar friend in uncertain territory. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a lunchtime investigation.

          Liam O&rsquo;Brien at Melville House looks at Texas booksellers who are trying to come to terms with the state&rsquo;s new open carry law. Many bookstores are banning guns:
I have always believed that bookstores are forums for all ideas, but I also understand that the free exchange of those ideas can be hindered (if not entirely obstructed) when one party in the conversation holds a deadly weapon. And one enterprising bookseller is actively encouraging guns:

Here&rsquo;s a painting of Seattle&rsquo;s own beloved son Ivar Haglund. Folk singer, restauranteur, accidental port commissioner, trouble-maker, inveterate punner (he&rsquo;s listed as the &ldquo;flounder&rdquo; of his seafood restaurant, Ivar&rsquo;s), and of mixed Scandehoovian lineage (his mother was Norwegian and his father was Swedish, nearly a Capulet/Montague situation).

        <div class="content">
          Last year, cartoonist Ted Rall visited Seattle with Snowden, a comic book biography of Edward Snowden. (I reviewed Snowden and interviewed Rall onstage at Town Hall.) Only a half-year later, Rall’s back, and reading at Town Hall tonight from his brand-new Bernie Sanders biography, Bernie.
Bernie and Snowden share many qualities. Rall makes them easy to read for comics newbies, pretty much drawing a single panel per page. They’re both openly advocating for their subjects — if you’re looking for objectivity, you shouldn’t be picking up a book by Rall in the first place — and they both provide plenty of context to establish the central figures within their time.

        <div class="content">
          After yesterday&rsquo;s gossip that Amazon is considering opening hundreds of Amazon Books locations nationwide in the next few years, Shelf Awareness, the industry news site which first broke the Amazon Books story, now says Amazon&rsquo;s plans are more modest, likely in the range of a dozen or so stores. We at the Seattle Review of Books have heard that, too, from people in the industry. Amazon, of course, could do away with these rumors immediately, but Amazon doesn&rsquo;t comment on stories like these.

*While the City Slept* will almost certainly be one of the best books I'll read this year. But I worked with its author, Eli Sanders, for almost ten years at *The Stranger*, and so there's too much of a conflict of interest for me to review it. (We [published Martin McClellan's great review of the book yesterday](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/uncommitted/); you should read it.) Instead, I met with Eli on Saturday, January 23rd for an interview about the process of writing *While the City Slept*, the structure of the book, the benefits of taking your time to tell a story, and what Seattleites can do to fix our broken mental health care system.
