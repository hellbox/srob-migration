          [The Most Misread Poem in America](http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/09/11/the-most-misread-poem-in-america/) David Orr, in an excerpt from his book The Road Not Taken: Finding America in the Poem Everyone Loves and Almost Everyone Gets Wrong, on Robert Frost&rsquo;s best known poem.
 Frost’s poem turns this expectation on its head. Most readers consider “The Road Not Taken” to be a paean to triumphant self-assertion (“I took the one less traveled by”), but the literal meaning of the poem’s own lines seems completely at odds with this interpretation.

          You&rsquo;re at the point in your book where you&rsquo;re talking to yourself, aren&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re probably feeling a bit manic about the whole thing. It&rsquo;s an itch that runs away laughing every time you try to scratch it. You probably haven&rsquo;t bathed for the past 10,000 words. It&rsquo;s so close, that line. If you&rsquo;re on track, according to our recommendations, you should have about 45,900 words down right now. You are almost done.

        <div class="content">
          By far, the most-hyped comics release of the week is DK III: The Master Race, the third volume in Frank Miller’s Dark Knight series. Ostensibly co-written by Brian Azzarello, the actual authorship of DK III is in question — Frank Miller has basically admitted that he’s not been involved in the writing of the series. Whoever actually wrote the story, Miller certainly didn’t draw the book; the art is by Andy Kubert, with inking by Dark Knight veteran Klaus Janson.

          It is as if we&rsquo;re in competition to find the starkest horror. This world offers so many comers to the table, each one bloodier, more callous, more inhumane, more despicable than the rest. Some are small insults that strike us in a particular way. Some are grand vistas of despair that we cannot comprehend en masse, and are represented for us by a single photograph, say of a suffering child, as we read the news.

          Yesterday, I told you about some local independent bookstores that you should visit on Small Business Saturday. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t buy books online, too! Below are three big sales from independent publishers just in time for Thanksgiving-weekend consumer madness. Buying directly from these publishers will help pay for more great new books in the coming year.
 On Monday, Seattle publisher Fantagraphics Books is having a 40% off sale on everything.

        <div class="content">
          Kristen Steenbeeke reports that Hugo House&rsquo;s crowd-sourced poetry experiment has come to a close for the year. Last week, Hugo House set up a stand with a typewriter at the University District Farmer&rsquo;s Market and encouraged passers-by to contribute to a group poem. The poets were only allowed to write one line, and they were only allowed to read the line that came before their line.
Is the end result great poetry?

          The weeks leading up to Thanksgiving are traditionally when booksellers look back at the year that was and prepare for the busiest few weeks of the year. Danielle Hulton, the co-founder and manager of our November bookstore of the month, Ada’s Technical Books, is in that process right now, and she feels pretty good about where her store is.

“This will be our third holiday” in the store’s new location on 15th Ave, she says, and “the excitement that we felt from customers and from the neighborhood two years ago seems to have stayed.
