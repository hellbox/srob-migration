          Let&rsquo;s be clear that this post at Web Urbanist is a multi-page list, which is a genre of blog post that usually deserves nothing but scorn. But I&rsquo;ll have to give it a pass, because it&rsquo;s about 14 modern library designs and it&rsquo;s the most beautiful thing I&rsquo;ve seen on the internet this week. Every single one of these spaces looks like a wonderful place to read; I especially love the Prague National Library, which looks like a giant cartoon amoeba.

J.A. Jance is the author of more than fifty mystery novels and novellas, parceled out into four distinct series. Arguably her most popular series revolves around Seattle investigator J.P. Beaumont, who has headlined 24 books since his introduction in 1985. Jance has been publishing at least one book a year for three decades, and she’s a bestselling author many times over. Her latest mystery, *Dance of the Bones*, pairs Beaumont with another of her series protagonists, Sheriff Brandon Walker, for the first time.

          On an uncharacteristically blustery Saturday, Seattle Mystery Bookshop employees Fran and Adele are getting the store ready for an author visit, but they’re happy to stop for anyone who wanders in out of the windstorm. They sometimes greet visitors with the words of the bookshop’s owner, JB Dickey: “you’re welcome to stay as long as you like, but we won’t feed you and we won’t do your laundry.”
Fran has worked at Seattle Mystery Bookshop for over 12 years.

          Swapna Krishna at Panels has collected some tweets by local novelist/comics writer G. Willow Wilson about motherhood and the business of art. Wilson, who&rsquo;s responding to a popular essay by Amanda Palmer, explains that editors and publishers levy &ldquo;a mommy tax&rdquo; on writers and other artists.
As contractors, Wilson says, women artists have &ldquo;zero legal protection,&rdquo; and the story of her own experiences is a real eye-opener: &ldquo;I wrote ALIF THE UNSEEN while pregnant and edited it with a newborn sleeping on my chest.

        <div class="content">
          You have two months to apply for Jack Straw&rsquo;s 2016 Writers Program. Don&rsquo;t know what that is? I&rsquo;ll let them explain:
Twelve writers, selected by an invited curator, create new work during the residency to be presented through live readings, recorded interviews, a published anthology, and as podcasts on our web site. Participants also receive professional training in voice and microphone technique, performance and delivery, and interviews. Previous Jack Straw writers include Rebecca Hoogs and David Schmader.

          (Once in a while, I take a new book with me to lunch and give it a half an hour or so to grab my attention. **Lunch Date** is my judgment on that speed-dating experience.)
**Who’s your date today?** *Atlanta Nights*, a novel that was crowdsourced by nearly three dozen science fiction writers.
**Where’d you go?** [Sprout](http://www.sprout-salads.com/) on the ground floor of the Smith Tower.
**What’d you eat?** I had the South by Northwest salad, which has all the ingredients you'd expect (steak, romaine, salsa, a cilantro-lime dressing) and some you wouldn't (chili-roasted sweet potatoes).

          Every Tuesday morning, we present a poem for you to enjoy, but this week we&rsquo;re going to do something a little different. I want to call a piece of public art to your attention. Robert Montgomery&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;The Stars Pulled Down for Real&rdquo; is the latest site-specific artwork at All Rise, the public art space located between Denny and John, down in the Denny Triangle. All Rise&rsquo;s website explains Montgomery&rsquo;s work as &ldquo;confront[ing] a post-utopian current while echoing a full, at times romantic, chronology of a land divided, shaped, and built ever-upward.

          Even though Seattle is happily back to its normal grey drizzle, we can&rsquo;t forget that the eastern half of Washington is currently battling the worst wildfires in state history. We&rsquo;ve already looked at how booksellers are surviving the fires, but here&rsquo;s a project that&rsquo;s worthy of your attention: every other day, Washington state Poet Laureate Elizabeth Austen will publish a poem relating to the wildfires. Yesterday, she published a beautiful poem by William Stafford about the Tillamook Burn.

        <div class="content">
          Some asshole at the Guardian who has never read one of Terry Pratchett&rsquo;s novels thinks Terry Pratchett is overrated. Yep, it&rsquo;s the same old boring &ldquo;serious literature&rdquo; conversation, with an added smear on a recently deceased author for good measure.
This is an obvious plea for attention, and you should ignore it. Go read a Terry Pratchett novel instead; if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with his work, we recommend Mort or The Colour of Magic to get you started.

          This week&rsquo;s sponsor is Chatwin Books, and we&rsquo;re featuring the introduction and a full chapter from The Announcers, by J.G Perkins.
This is the first volume in Perkins&rsquo; 19-volume Darkness Before Mourning, one of the largest series of serious fiction ever created by a single author. We&rsquo;re featuring the Introduction, and chapter 15, for you to read in their entirety.
 For those who shared it, the American Dream was wonderful.
