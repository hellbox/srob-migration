          Joan Rivers was one of the most fascinating entertainers of the 20th century. Anyone over the age of 30 can probably tell you something about her life — the way Johnny Carson blacklisted her from his show, for instance, or her QVC shopping empire, or her vicious insults of celebrities, or her catchphrase, &ldquo;can we talk?&rdquo; — and every adult under 30 has undoubtedly seen a comedian who was profoundly influenced by Rivers&rsquo;s work.

          The Hollywood Reporter ran a gushing press release this morning announcing Simon and Schuster&rsquo;s decision to publish Milo Yiannopoulos&rsquo;s memoir. Get a load of this swill:
"I met with top execs at Simon & Schuster earlier in the year and spent half an hour trying to shock them with lewd jokes and outrageous opinions. I thought they were going to have me escorted from the building -- but instead they offered me a wheelbarrow full of money,"

        <div class="content">
          By the end of 2016, I found myself completely disillusioned by corporate comics. Marvel Comics seem to be a neverending morass of recycled events and weird brand management choices. A few DC Comics titles are promising, but it seems as though getting comfortable there might be a mistake since the entire line will likely be rebooted as soon as sales drop low enough. These things happen in cycles, of course. A few years ago, Marvel was producing a bunch of work that transcended corporate dictates, and DC has had its moments over the last decade, too.

          Wednesday December 28th: Play It As It Lays Book Club
Booksellers at the south end’s newest bookstore discuss the divine Joan Didion’s 1970 novel Play It As It Lays. Didion is (rightfully) best known for her nonfiction, but her novels are in danger of being entirely forgotten. Let Thid Place’s Anje and Wesley help you understand why that would be an absolute crime. Third Place Books Seward Park, 5041 Wilson Ave S, 474-2200, http://thirdplacebooks.

          If you&rsquo;re going to be traveling home after the holidays and you stop in the airport bookstore looking for something to read, you could do a lot worse than Robert Harris&rsquo;s new novel Conclave. It feels like a slight read, a novella that was blown out to fit into a novel — I thought I&rsquo;d been sent a large print edition when I first opened Conclave and saw the huge font size — but it&rsquo;s the perfect length for a plane ride and it&rsquo;ll keep you turning pages through even the worst turbulence.

I won&rsquo;t leave, he latches my shoulder and

through the milk glass, flapping goodbye like a sail

words and names — medicine&rsquo;s blunt instruments —
undid me. And the seconds, the half seconds
it took for him to say those words). For now,

Our sponsor this week, Martin McClellan, wants you to know he just published his entire novel to read online for free!
Wait — isn't he one of the co-founders of this site? 
Sure is!
Isn't that a little...unethical?
How so?
Well, I mean, he's advertising his own product on the place he runs. Kind of like a conflict-of-interest isn't it?
No, not really — it's what, in the tech world, they call "
