        <div class="content">
          Brad Craft, the used book buyer at University Book Store, says he “didn’t grow up in a bookish atmosphere” — he didn’t have access to a good library, and none of his teachers introduced him to the joys of literature. Where did he learn to love books? “Yard sales,” he says. He was especially drawn to a certain type of book: “I’ve read more gothic romance novels than most men my age,” Craft explains.

        <div class="content">
          The rule of thumb about questions in headlines — that most headline questions can be answered, simply, &ldquo;no&rdquo; — has never been more true than in this blog post, which is headlined &ldquo;Are Paid Book Reviews Worth It?&rdquo;
I didn&rsquo;t know that paid book reviews existed, but now I&rsquo;m horrified to learn that they do. Here&rsquo;s the thing: if you&rsquo;re paying for a review, the likely audience of that review is just going to be a bunch of authors who have also paid for reviews.

        <div class="content">
          Last week, Joni Balter was nice enough to ask Steve Scher and me to interview Seattle librarian-legend Nancy Pearl on her show Civic Cocktail. I asked her how she felt about recent anti-book library policies taking root in the Seattle Public Library and in libraries around the country. You can watch the show below:

          343.
Eve of the new year. Bitter cold city. I sit by the café window, bring the soup bowl to my lips. Someone in the park across the street is swinging high on a swing-set in the dark. 344.
At least one keyhole has been stuffed with tissue by a previous tenant. So there is no seeing through. 345.
A very partial morning. The things I am trying constantly to re-make, alter, edit, adjust.

        <div class="content">
          Remember the &ldquo;If All Seattle Read the Same Book&rdquo; program that Nancy Pearl started almost twenty years ago? Did you know it&rsquo;s still going on? It&rsquo;s true! Only a few years ago, Seattle Public Library changed the title of the program from Nancy Pearl&rsquo;s super-cool name to the much-less-compelling &ldquo;Seattle Reads.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s still basically the same idea: SPL has a ton of copies of one book, and the author appears at library branches all around town to talk about the book.

          We&rsquo;re thrilled to have Kelley Eskridge back as a sponsor this week. Her fantastic book Solitaire has been turned into a feature film, titled Otherlife. That means it&rsquo;s time to read the book before the film arrives into the world. Read the entire first chapter on ours sponsors page. Also, check out Kelley&rsquo;s writing about what it was like to write this film based on her book.
If you&rsquo;re a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, take a look at our open dates.

          MONDAY Kick your week off right, with the very first “Ask the Oracle” event at the Sorrento Hotel. This is a new fortune-telling themed reading series from the Hugo House, and it’s got a great gimmick: audience members anonymously ask questions about their futures. The authors find answers to those questions in their books. Hugo House supplied a sample Q&amp;A in the promotional materials:
**Question**: Should I move to a new city soon?

 "The great tradition of black art, generally," he started again, "is the ability — unlike American art in general — to tell the truth. Because it was formed around the great American poison, the thing that poisoned American consciousness and behavior: racism.
