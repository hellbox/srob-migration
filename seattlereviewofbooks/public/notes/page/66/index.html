          This is a neat idea: Alexander Chee is taking over the Hugo House&rsquo;s Instagram feed this week to provide teasers of the story he&rsquo;ll be reading at the House&rsquo;s Literary Series event this Friday.
 Happy Halloween! This has to be the best literary Halloween tweet of the year:
  I just passed a young woman wearing a sombrero, would be so dope if her costume was &quot;lionel shriver&quot;

          (Photo of Ebo Barton by Adam Rubinstein of [Stopped Down Studio](http://www.stoppeddown.studio/).) Earlier this month, Seattle poet [Ebo Barton](https://www.facebook.com/pg/ebobartonpoetry/about/?entry_point=page_nav_about_item&tab=page_info) took fifth place at the Individual World Poetry Slam in Flagstaff Arizona. We talked with them over email about the championship and the state of poetry in Seattle right now.
**Could you tell our readers what the process of getting to the Individual World Poetry Slam was like? How did you wind up delivering spoken word to an audience of people in Flagstaf?

**Dear Cienna,**
**How do you feel about writing in books? I mean, jotting notes in the margins and highlighting and all that crap. I read somewhere that doing that is supposed to make you smarter, but it just seems like defacing the book to me.

Someone more equipped to do arithmetic should figure out how many possible combinations of readings were available at Lit Crawl last night. With 35 readings stretched across four hours, your Lit Crawl experience was guaranteed to be different from mine. And that’s sort of the appeal: to overwhelm your senses and to give you too many options. You’re supposed to finish Lit Crawl feeling as though you missed out on something.

Tea herself notified us last night, however, that the review needs one correction:
