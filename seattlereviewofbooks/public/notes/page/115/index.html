Today is the sixth annual GiveBIG charitable giving event. The deal with GiveBIG is that for one day out of the year, the Seattle Foundation will stretch your donations to nonprofits with funds of their own. In their last five years, they&rsquo;ve given more than $56 million to Seattle-area nonprofits.
But how do you sift through the dozens of GiveBIG nonprofits to find the organizations who do the work that you&rsquo;re most passionate about?

          Sponsor Steve Toutonghi&rsquo;s debut Science Fiction Novel Join was just released, and you owe it to yourself to check out the first chapter on our sponsorship page.
Join is a mind-expanding story set in a world where multiple people can join into a single consciousness. The tale is rich, tense, and nuanced, and full of the mind-expanding ideas only possible in a good science fiction story. We&rsquo;re so grateful to Steve for his sponsorship, and urge you to take a look.

&mdash; Courtney (@seattlecourtney) May 1, 2016 I‚Äôm not from here. I arrived from New England, in 1993, a grunge-hating, coffee-agnostic seventeen-year-old. Hours in mosh pits covered in other people‚Äôs sweat and spit while gazing adoringly at Mark Arm taught me to love the music of this place; becoming a sleepless single mother taught me the joy in the local joe. A great deal of the rest of what I know ‚Äî about the Pacific Northwest and about life ‚Äî I learned from independent bookstores and the people who love them.

The top of Queen Anne, to me, often feels like an island. The rhythms are different up there than you‚Äôll find down on the streets of Seattle. It‚Äôs quieter, a little calmer. Maybe that‚Äôs why Queen Anne Book Company, our May Bookstore of the Month, feels a little bit like an island bookstore: it‚Äôs small, but it‚Äôs incredibly well-stocked for a store of its size. Bookstores on islands have to have a phenomenal collection of books, because they can‚Äôt rely on luxuries like next-day shipping or conveniently located book distributors the way mainland bookstores do.

          Uncanny Valley I have mixed feelings about this form &mdash; we&rsquo;ve seen them before, notes from inside the boom industry. It&rsquo;s personal essay, not reportage, it&rsquo;s a confession from the one who accepted the paycheck and now feels that the price of this betrayal to their college idealism is exposure of their lush corporate lifestyle. We&rsquo;ve read them from inside Wall Street and Hollywood, Real Estate, and now the tech boom.

          After you&rsquo;ve celebrated Independent Bookstore Day tomorrow, I hope you&rsquo;ll come out to Phinney Books for a special edition of the Dock Street Salon. Spokane author Shann Ray, who wrote the novel American Copper, will read and then he and I will be in conversation. Copper is a novel about Montana in the early 20th century, and Ray has very interesting things to say about masculinity. He also, according to his bio, &ldquo;teaches leadership and forgiveness studies at Gonzaga University,&rdquo; which is absolutely fascinating.

**Dear Cienna,**
I&rsquo;m a bookseller at an independent bookstore in Seattle. (No, not that one.) I&rsquo;m used to people having bad taste when it comes to books, but every time someone buys an adult coloring book from me, I become irrationally mad.
