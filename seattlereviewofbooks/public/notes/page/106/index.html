          Well, this is huge.
Now after 13 years of remarkable rewards, a ton of laughs, hard work, good cheer, and so many remarkable children and families in my life, I’m ready to start new projects, write new stories, and make time for yet more fearless adventures.
The timing is right. We have weathered some big changes in the organization and will be returning to our remodeled post-gas-explosion site in a few weeks.

          This, which we found on poet Kelli Russell Agodon&rsquo;s Twitter feed, is a terrific idea: poet.tips recommends poets to you, in the by-now-ubiquitous internet recommendation format of &ldquo;If you like X, then you&rsquo;ll like Y.&rdquo; The engine stretches from classics&hellip;
 Edna St. Vincent Millay T.S. Eliot Denise Levertov  &hellip;to contemporary greats&hellip;
 Patricia Lockwood Dorothea Lasky Alice Notley Eileen Myles  &hellip;to local favorites:
 Kelli Russell Agodon Sherman Alexie Karen Finneyfrock Maged Zaher  Recommendation engines are not the be-all end-all of discovery, of course, but they can send you on some interesting tangents.

          There used to be two LGBT-themed bookstores on Capitol Hill alone. Now there are none. Lots of people would say that this is a sign of progress — after all, though we may not have a Beyond the Closet or a Bailey/Coy on Capitol Hill anymore, pretty much every bookstore in town now has a huge section devoted to LGBT issues. Virtually every bookstore I can think of has at least one LGBT employee, and some have many more than one.

          Science fiction has always inspired real-world technological advances. The very first employees of NASA were inspired by the rocket-ship and ray-gun festooned pulp sci-fi of the 1930s and 1940s. Most of the greatest innovators of the last 30 years have found their inspiration in sci-fi novels. Steve Jobs, creepily, recommended 1984 to new hires at Apple. Elon Musk is very public about his love of Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and Douglas Adams.

          Sponsor Paul Mullin has your Father&rsquo;s Day gift covered. His book The Starting Gate is part memoir, part life-manual, and all entertainment. You can read a full chapter, that will guide you through a graduate-level course of how to drink in bars, on our sponsor page.
Of course you can buy it online, but Paul wants to be sure you know you can also pick up the book locally Third Place Books, Elliott Bay Book Company, and Phinney Books.

          In 2013, I won *The Stranger*’s Genius Award in literature, which came as a wondrous gift that linked me to the place I lived and wrote in for fourteen years (by then.) Part of the responsibility of winning a Genius Award is to vote in future Genius competitions. This year’s nominees include local poetry publisher Wave Books. I want to explain why I will probably not vote for them.
It all started few years ago.

          for missing First Nations women
This is a canvas of blood &mdash;
A hazy procession of the baited.
The earth is asleep.
The sky is awake.
And the wind leaves behind the awful heaviness of bodies.
Hoofbeats sprout curses &mdash; crisp, greaseless.
The song across rooftops is a wild conflation of grisly wrongs.
I’ll tell you a lie that you can believe, like a noose of braided black hair:
Life made me meager with the dementia of police reports.

          It&rsquo;s Memorial Day, which means summer is due to arrive here in Seattle sometime in the next two to ten weeks. This is the time of year when you see a lot of sites promote their summer reading lists. We&rsquo;ve never been especially into lists here at the Seattle Review of Books, but if you dig them, that&rsquo;s great. We&rsquo;re happy you&rsquo;ll soon have a lot of lists to choose from.

It's Memorial Day weekend in Seattle, which means it's perfect movie-watching weather! I hope you'll come to [SIFF's Shoreline outpost](http://www.siff.net/shoreline-community-college) tomorrow at 3 pm to watch a secreening of *Author: The JT LeRoy Story*. I'll be interviewing director Jeff Feuerzeig after the film. [The Vulture's Bilge Ebiri](http://www.vulture.com/2016/01/sundance-review-author-the-jt-leroy-story.html) reviewed the movie when it debuted at Sundance, calling it...
...a maze of identity: A girl who dreams of herself as a boy who dreams of himself as a girl, played by a girl pretending to be a boy, all overseen by the girl herself, playing another, different girl.
