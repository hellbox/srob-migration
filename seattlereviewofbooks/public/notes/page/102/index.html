Wednesday June 15: Grunt Reading
Perhaps you’ve read one or two of Mary Roach’s very funny investigations of weird everyday science (Stiff, about death and dying, was her debut; Bonk, about sex, was another high point). Her latest, Grunt, is about the science of war, and it promises more shocking, ridiculous, and downright disgusting revelations. I&rsquo;ll be joining Roach onstage for a Q&amp;A. Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.

“The pregnant girl enters the Trenton Family Clinic,” begins Tracy Barone’s debut novel Happy Family, “looking like she parted the Red Sea to get there. The lower half of her dress is wet with amniotic fluid, and the upper half is streaked with sweat.” This is a grand opening line for a novel, dense with imagery, evocative of the Bible, and thick with bodily fluids. It promises both legend and messy corporeality.

          We have an Instagram account! Let me utilize it here to extend some thanks.
Last Friday, Push/Pull Gallery and the Seattle Review of Books teamed up to host Christine Marie Larsen&rsquo;s opening at the Essential Natural Mattress store, in Belltown. Hanging on the wall, all around us, were the originals of the portraits she paints for us each week.
Also in attendence, were three readers who did us the honor of showing up, presenting some work, and then, posing with their portraits.

          Charlotte Runcie at The Telegraph does some literary sleuthing to contextualize the literary tradition that inspired the sonnet that Lin-Manuel Miranda read at the Tony Awards on Sunday.
...Miranda’s sonnet is 16 lines long, and has some moments of unconventional rhythm. What does that tell us? The best-known writer of the 16-line sonnet is probably the Victorian writer George Meredith, who wrote a sequence of them titled ‘Modern Love’, exploring his own disastrous marriage and expressing a sentiment that love in his time had become corrupted and corrosive.

          What I brew in me
your tongue no longer tastes.
Do you believe passion
or security
ruins the palette?
We once boiled red
like the most glorious
emergency
and at the worst times.
Sip me
before I’m lukewarm,
before the whistle of regret
keeps us awake.
Dear love, last night
I walked in the rain
dressed only in a bathrobe. I bought
a little kettle on sale
and am convinced our lives

          One of the most famous translators in the world has died, ABC News reports:
Rabassa was an essential gateway to the 1960s Latin American "boom," when such authors as Garcia Marquez, Cortazar and Mario Vargas Llosa became widely known internationally. He worked on the novel that helped start the boom, Cortazar's *Hopscotch*, for which Rabassa won a National Book Award for translation. He also worked on the novel which defined the boom, Garcia Marquez's *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, a monument of 20th century literature.

          Hastings, a national chain selling books, comics, music, and movies, announced that if buyers for its 126 stores cannot be found, they will be forced to close down.
Hastings has been working diligently to overcome our business challenges and we have made significant progress with a remerchandising strategy and other initiatives aimed at increasing profitability. To continue our transformation, we have initiated a comprehensive process to identify a buyer or investor that will give us the additional financial stability we need to move forward.
