        <div class="content">
          Art saves nothing
and this is not art
just words running
in lines, hoping to reach
redemption. Meanwhile
time is running&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out
for bat and bee,
hippo and elephant.
Coral reefs are dying. Salmon,
once wild, breed in tubs.
Don&rsquo;t put your hope in poems
that plot the putrid doings
of bankers, that bank
on Franz Marc&rsquo;s red horses
gamboling and grazing,
as if we&rsquo;d never learned
to fabricate glue from hooves.

        <div class="content">
          Congratulations to Sherman Alexie, who was nominated for his children&rsquo;s book Thunder Boy Jr. in the Young Readers&rsquo; Literature category. We loved the book (as did our resident six-year-old).
And now seems like a good time to announce: join us, Sherman Alexie, Robert Lashley, and EJ Koh at the Elliott Bay Book Company on November 11th for a poetry reading. Eagle-eyed viewers will recognize this as our Bumbershoot lineup. We felt the night was so magical, we wanted to recreate it outside of the ticketed bounds of the Bumbershoot arena.

        <div class="content">
          The truth is, he doesn’t. In fact, Carl Phillips is confused about the controversy his nomination is causing among Washington state poets. When I spoke with Phillips this morning he mentioned his total surprise and delight when informed by his publisher that his book Renaissance was nominated for this year’s Washington State Book Award. He went on to say that the book was submitted by his publisher, Farrar, Strauss &amp; Giroux.

        <div class="content">
          Lion Heart Book Store houses an eclectic collection of volumes, keeping the shelves as interesting as their owner and visitors. The turnover is fast, too — titles come and go as everyone who visits finds something that intrigues them. The most popular books come from the fiction section, but people ask for a great variety of titles, editions, and genres. The mystery section is always well-stocked, with paperbacks stuffed into narrow shelves with no wiggle room.

          Edward Albee, Playwright of a Desperate Generation, Dies at 88 One of the great tragedies of a good obituary is that someone needs to die in order for it to be read. I&rsquo;ve seen a number of Albee plays, but knew very little about the man himself.
 Sent to an adoption nursery in Manhattan before he was three weeks old, baby Edward was placed with Reed Albee, an heir to the Keith-Albee chain of vaudeville theaters, and his wife, Frances, who lived in Larchmont, N.

        <div class="content">
          In case you couldn&rsquo;t tell from our diversity reports or our thoughts on the current discussion on cultural appropriation in fiction, we take issues of diversity seriously here at the Seattle Review of Books. We don&rsquo;t always get it right, but we try. And we think it&rsquo;s always important for Seattle&rsquo;s literary community to keep issues of diversity in mind.
That&rsquo;s why I want you to know about the second in a series of free workshops on racial equity in the literary arts that&rsquo;s sponsored by Seattle: City of Literature.

          When I was young I worked at a vegetarian restaurant, The Morningtown, which ironically, opened on the day I was born. Ironic, because working there was kind of a birth of my adult self from my teenage self. I learned a lot.
Every day for lunch a nice young woman would come in and order black beans and rice and tahini. We made really good tahini. She never varied her order, but she was a valued regular who ate there every day.
