Writer Tom King’s The Vision series from Marvel Comics is such a weird, wonderful thing. It’s a superhero comic that features virtually no superheroics, a domestic drama about superheroes that’s more interested in the psychology of its main characters than their powers. It’s a Cheeveresque suburban drama where the secrets that the main characters keep from each other manifest in the form of murder and the deeper issues of faith and existential angst materialize in the form of the convoluted Gordian knot of comics history.

          Lincoln Michel at Electric Lit takes a look at an (depressing, not-always-very-accurate) annual report on how much authors earn. Turns out, a tiny amount of writers actually make above poverty wages. The rest are just in it for the art.

          **Wednesday June 8: *Homegoing* Reading **
It’s hard to turn anyone’s head with a dust jacket blurb these days, but the rare appearance of a Ta-Nehisi Coates blurb on Yaa Gyasi’s debut novel *Homegoing* — calling the book an “inspiration” and citing its “so fully realized, so elegantly carved” characters — is a rare meaningful instance. It announces this book as something worth your time. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.

If you grew up as a comics fan before the turn of the century, the giant posters in front of SAM celebrating their new Graphic Masters exhibit right now are sure to send a little shiver of joy running down your spine. Walk down First Avenue and you’ll be sure to see them: two giant posters reproducing artwork from Goya and Picasso, right next to a giant poster featuring Robert Crumb.

          At her day job, Seattle cartoonist Colleen Frakes of Prison Island fameis a librarian. She combined those two worlds in a (PDF) comic about information literacy and librarian science.

Thomas Gammarino about sci-fi, book design, and epistemology</a></h1>
        
        <div class="content">
          M. Thomas Gammarino’s *King of the Worlds* is an excellent sci-fi novel that combines the interiority of literary fiction from the 50s, 60s and 70s with the all-out weirdness of the golden age of science fiction. (You can [read my review here](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-final-frontier/).) It’s set in an alternate universe in which a child actor named Dylan Greenyears stars in a wildly popular Terry Gilliam-directed sequel to *ET: The Extraterrestrial.* Greenyears becomes a huge celebrity, but then he’s publicly humiliated when James Cameron fires him from *Titanic*.

          This Albany Times Union interview with a local librarian named Lauren Cardinal has a very interesting aside:
**Pine Hills just went back to the Dewey Decimal System; how do you feel about it?**
I’m not sure who was happier—the staff or the patrons! The branches had been using a “bookstore model” for a few years, where books are more loosely arranged by topic, not by the official Dewey numbers and categories.
