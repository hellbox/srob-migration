          To celebrate the paperback release of his excellent novel Lovecraft Country, Seattle author Matt Ruff is doing an AMA (that stands for &ldquo;Ask Me Anything&rdquo;) on Reddit right now. (And if you&rsquo;re looking for inspiration for things to ask him, here&rsquo;s my interview with Ruff from his book launch party last year.)

We're so excited to have Matthew Amster-Burton as our sponsor this week. His new novel _Our Secret Better Lives_ is a funny, stirring, and exciting tale. Set in 1994, it's about Katy, a huge music fan on a big adventure to a new state and college, who finds herself doing one thing she never imagined: stepping in front of a microphone in a new band.
We&rsquo;ve got a full chapter, and more information, on our sponsor&rsquo;s page so you can see just how deftly Matthew handles these engaging characters.

          Wallingford comics shop Comics Dungeon is becoming a nonprofit. From the press release:  Seattle comic book store, Comics Dungeon, Inc., has made the change to leave behind its for-profit status to become a fully non-profit corporation.
Comics Dungeon, Inc will be changing its name to Comics for Community, Compassion and Culture, C4C3. “After being part of the community for over 25 years, we wanted our focus to be giving back to the very community that built our success,” said Scott Tomlin, C4C3’s president.

          Paul Auster reading at @town_hall_seattle tonight. Part of the q&amp;a dealt with Auster&#39;s work with @pen_america: he offered the thought that, in authoritarian regimes, the &#34;act of novel-writing enforces democracy&#34;. Astonishing that that insight now applies in the United States. #paulauster #townhallseattle #bookreading #author #books #novel #reading #makeamericareadagain #dumptrump #glisteningocherousamoeba @faberbooks @henryholtbooks

          Doris Lessing’s library: a life in 4,000 books To an incurable book snoop, this seems like the opportunity of a lifetime: Nick Holdstock was given free access to Doris Lessing&#8217;s books in order to inventory them after her death. It&#8217;s a massive project (Lessing&#8217;s collection, Holdstock says, &#8220;seemed untouched by what Walter Benjamin called &#8216;the mild boredom of order&#8217;&#8221;), to which he brings a storyteller&#8217;s eye, tracking Lessing&#8217;s studies, her eccentricities, and her ongoing conversation with the books she loved.

  Standing on the northeast corner of Third and Stewart, looking south on Third, one sees a sky bridge. It connects a parking garage to the building that once housed The Bon Marché, one of three powerhouse retailers that bounded out of the wellspring of Seattle in the olden days.
