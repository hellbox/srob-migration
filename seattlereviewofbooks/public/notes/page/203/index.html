          Marvel Comics recently announced they were publishing hip-hop themed covers on all their books in October. This launched a conversation about the fact that Marvel doesn&rsquo;t hire people of color to write their books, which kind of makes this whole hip-hop cover thing smack of appropriation.
Comics critic David Brothers wrote an excellent long Tumblr post about why people of color are unhappy about this cover tribute, and you should read the whole thing.

        <div class="content">
          For a while there in 2009, reporting on books and publishing basically involved firing up the old internet-box on a daily basis and looking around to see which magazines were going out of business. Thankfully that crisis has passed, but we still lose good magazines every now and again. National Journal&rsquo;s print publication is going under at the end of this year; the publisher says &ldquo;News in DC now moves too quickly for a weekly publication.

          (*Every comics fan knows that Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country. Thursday Comics Hangover is a weekly column reviewing some of the new books that I pick up at Phoenix Comics, my friendly neighborhood comic book store*.)

Serialized anthology comics are tough. They’re a pain to coordinate, for starters, and it’s hard to find an audience for a series of short, ongoing stories by a wide array of artists.

          Cartoonist Matt Bors just announced that his online cartooning hub The Nib has parted ways with blogging site Medium. Of the split with Medium, Bors simply says &ldquo;our ambitions diverged,&rdquo; and he promises that &ldquo;I don’t think it will be long until I have something to announce&rdquo; in terms of The Nib finding a new home. Let&rsquo;s hope not; The Nib has been publishing some great comics on a regular basis and in its short year and a half of existence, it became a destination for those in search of good comics on the web.

        <div class="content">
          Today, in case you can&rsquo;t tell from the flurry of posts on the internet and on this site, is the official release day of the To Kill a Mockingbird sequel/prequel. If you&rsquo;re frustrated by the overkill, I promise it will all be over tomorrow. But until then, Quartz has discovered that significant portions of Watchman very closely resemble significant portions of Mockingbird. Of course, self-plagiarism is no crime — and by all accounts, Watchman was an early draft of Mockingbird, which explains the overlap — but it again raises the question of why Watchman even exists.

          In letters to the Justice Department, authors and booksellers allege that &ldquo;Amazon has used its dominance in ways that we believe harm the interests of America’s readers, impoverish the book industry as a whole, damage the careers of (and generate fear among) many authors, and impede the free flow of ideas in our society.”

        <div class="content">
          Republican presidential candidate/human idea toilet Ted Cruz just published a new memoir to promote his presidential campaign. The New York Times refused to put the book on its bestseller list, saying its sales numbers were inflated due to &ldquo;strategic bulk purchases.&rdquo; Now Amazon and the book&rsquo;s publisher, Harper Collins, are both defending Cruz, saying they see no sign of bulk purchases.
I mean, the dirty secret of all bestselling political books is that they&rsquo;re manipulated by bulk purchases.
