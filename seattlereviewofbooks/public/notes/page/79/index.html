          Sponsor Barbara E Geary is here to introduce you to her book I Can Speak Medical!, a light and fun introduction to medical terms and speak. Geary was a professional registered nurse, and taught an Introduction to Medical Vocabulary class. She brings that expertise to her great book.
You can read her introduction on our sponsor&rsquo;s page. You&rsquo;ll find the book a great resource &mdash; yes, for people entering the medical profession, but also for the layperson who may be encountering the world of medical language and wanting to understand more.

          On my second visit to Lion Heart Book Store, I overheard David entertaining a small audience with a story involving a large caterpillar on an expensive rug. Like with many customers, he remembered me and greeted me by name. Lion Heart Book Store is full of stories, but not only from Davidâ€™s life and the books that surround him. Visitors seem eager to share their own stories: they tell him about their book collections, their jobs, their favorite novels, their pipe dreams.

          Eugene Kim at Business Insider writes:
Amazon is aggressively expanding its presence in the real-world retail market, with a plan to open dozens of new pop-up stores in US shopping malls over the next year, a source familiar with the matter told Business Insider. These stores mostly seem to be device sales locations, not bookstores. Meanwhile, Barnes &amp; Noble&rsquo;s founder and interim CEO calls the retail environment &ldquo;one of the worst I have ever experienced in the 50 years I have been in this industry.

Dear Cienna,
**I refuse to buy books from Amazon, either in physical or ebook format. The way they shut down bookstores was morally reprehensible.**
But Iâ€™m ashamed to even type this â€” I buy everything else from Amazon.

        <div class="content">
          Margaret Atwood deserves the Nobel Prize for Literature. Sheâ€™s written some of the best books written in English over the last fifty years and her range far surpasses most of her American contemporaries, stretching from science fiction to literary fiction and back again. Sheâ€™s an underrated poet. And sheâ€™s terrific on Twitter. So when Portland comics publisher Dark Horse announced that they would be publishing Atwoodâ€™s first comic, Angel Catbird, in the fall of 2016, I was understandably excited.
