          This is the most perfect thing for an election year. Sponsor Entre Rios books, who makes those lovely poetry volumes that are so beautiful in the hand, is back to show off their upcoming collection of Percy Bysse Shelley&rsquo;s political poems.
What? Didn&rsquo;t you know that Shelley wrote political poems? They were not collected until after his death, and were often passed around hand-to-hand in activist circles. We&rsquo;ve got a sample page and sample poem on our sponsors page.

          Are e-books the solution to our education crisis? Not so fast, says Juanita Giles at the Washington Post:  Even if our poorest schools had broadband and ample devices, believing that free e-books are the key to ending our literacy crisis is dangerously misguided. Technology is repeatedly touted as a cure for the United States’ educational woes, promising everything from banishing boredom to widespread reform. Interactive whiteboards were the hope a few years ago, and Google Earth was supposed to make our children masters of geography.

        <div class="content">
          Last weekend’s 39th annual Norwescon, as per usual, was the most fun a human being could possibly have in SeaTac. The sci-fi convention never fell for the media bombast and glitz that comic book conventions became enchanted by a decade ago; it’s always been a convention for fans and by fans, which means it’s a rare opportunity for writers and readers to get together in a low-stress, friendly environment.
The belle of the ball this year was Seattle author Ramez Naam, whose novel Apex won the Philip K.

          To celebrate the last week of our monthlong Seattle school library tour, we thought we’d ask a pair of librarians to share in their own words what books their students are reading right now.
Elaine Harger is a school librarian at Washington Middle School. She’s also the author of a new book titled Which Side Are You On? Seven Social Responsibility Debates in American Librarianship, 1990-2015.

        <div class="content">
          Jim Harrison, the prolific half-blind masculinist writer of many books of fiction and poetry, has died at 78.
Harrison was perhaps the last of a certain kind of writer, a craggy individualist compared often (to his apparent annoyance) to Hemingway and Faulkner; a man of great appetites (of which food should be included, as he wrote extensively on the subject), an outdoorsman, and, as might be imagined, an iconoclast of the particular rugged American variety.

          Legalize It All Dan Baum exploded the internet with his opening paragraphs of this piece about legalizing drugs, but the rest of it is worth spending time with.
 At the time, I was writing a book about the politics of drug prohibition. I started to ask Ehrlichman a series of earnest, wonky questions that he impatiently waved away. “You want to know what this was really all about?” he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect.

This is the most consistently entertaining — and consistently crowded — poetry reading series in town, and on April 7th it will say goodbye to the stage where it was born.
