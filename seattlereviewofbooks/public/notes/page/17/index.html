Cathy Malkasian’s fourth comic, *Eartha*, is a tense and gorgeous journey. Reading Malkasian’s comics is perhaps the closest equivalent to dreaming that you can experience while you’re awake. The comics feel raw and mysterious and unsettling and more than a little dangerous.
The titular character in *Eartha* is a naïve young woman who sets out to return dreams to her society. The book feels entirely set in the subconscious — a world in which people read four-word news blurbs printed on biscuits and then perform their emotions of distress about the news in public.

        <div class="content">
          The library looks gorgeous and the plan for it to be a community center in the South Side of Chicago is wonderful. Something that I&rsquo;m not happy about: it&rsquo;s going to be the first paperless presidential library. You&rsquo;d think that a president who loves books as much as Obama would understand the value of the printed word. In a world full of bad news, I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time or energy complaining about this.

I’ve never been to Seattle, but I’m a fan of this site and, especially, your column. One day I’d like to visit your beautiful library and find some of the places I’ve read about in Seattle-set novels that I’ve read.

          Congratulations are due to Seattle&rsquo;s own Fantagraphics Books, which cleaned up in the Eisner Awards nominations this week. (The Eisners are the comics version of the Oscars.) Fnatagraphics picked up more nominations than almost any other publisher. Go help them celebrate tomorrow by visiting their store for Free Comic Book Day.
 We haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of new work from Seattle author Stacey Levine in a while. Levine, who writes delicately crafted sentences that shine like jewels and howl with the wind of alien planets, hasn&rsquo;t published a book since 2011.

It&rsquo;s strange: Most everyone at the Reading Through It Book Club last night agreed that Jonathan Haidt&rsquo;s book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided By Politics and Religion was the most useful book we&rsquo;ve read so far in our quest to understand the presidency of Donald Trump. One book club member even said that she felt if she had read The Righteous Mind before the election, she&rsquo;d probably have been able to predict that Trump would win.

If you&rsquo;ve never participated before, you should know that it&rsquo;s pretty simple: walk into the store, get some comics for free.
