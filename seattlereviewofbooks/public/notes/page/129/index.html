We've [already told you](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/09/bookslut-is-shutting-down/) that Jessa Crispin is shutting down her book review and news site, Bookslut, after 14 years. This is very sad. The good news is that Crispin reads in Seattle tomorrow night from her new book, *The Creative Tarot*. She'll be [reading at University Book Store at 7 pm, and it's free](https://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=03&evyear=2016&eventid=2016021108384500). And meanwhile, over at the Rumpus, you should [read this interview with Crispin](http://therumpus.net/2016/03/the-rumpus-interview-with-jessa-crispin/) that, while recorded before the announcement of Bookslut's closure, certainly seems to offer some foreshadowing to the fact that Crispin is ready to move on: **Rumpus**: Do you dislike American literature?

          Artyom Trakhanov, where have you been all my life? Trakhanov is the artist for a new miniseries from Boom! called Turncoat, and his art is unlike just about anyone working in the American comics business today. Trakhanov’s art is along the lines of European comics artists, (which makes sense, since he’s Russian) meaning it’s obsessively detailed, focused on different kinds of panel-to-panel transitions than American counterparts, and packed full of interesting, unique characters.

        <div class="content">
          Tonight is the monthly meeting for SCBWI of Western Washington (Society of Children&rsquo;s Book Writers and Illustrators), and the topic is diversity. Anybody who follows the children&rsquo;s market knows that diversity is a huge issue right now. From Marley Dias to George Washinton&rsquo;s slaves, this is an important issue to explore in depth, especially from the point-of-view of creators. A great panel, including Philip Lee of Lee &amp; Low Books, Kelly Jones, KCLS librarian Ann Crewdson, and Liz Wong, will be on hand to explore and offer suggestions.

        <div class="content">
          Last night, dozens of people packed into the (drafty, noisy) side room at the Pine Box to celebrate the opening night of the APRIL Festival. They were rewarded with four readings about youth and old age, about coming-of-age celebrations and old traditions.
Portland novelist Sara Jaffe and APRIL writer-in-residence Jenny Zhang shared a youthful approach. Jaffe read a portion of her debut novel Dryland, about a 15-year-old girl in 1992. It opened with the protagonist conflating the Eric Clapton songs “Wonderful Tonight” and “Tears in Heaven,” but most of the excerpt wasn’t interested in a nostalgia trip, or 90s-night jokes.
