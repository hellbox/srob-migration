          We reported at the beginning of this month that Open Books owner John Marshall was in the &ldquo;closing stages&rdquo; of selling his poetry bookshop to a new owner. The closing stages have finally closed, and in an email to customers last night, Marshall finally revealed the new owner&rsquo;s name:
We are exceedingly happy to announce that **the next owner of Open Books: A Poem Emporium will be Billie Swift**. She has been an avid customer for years, has a sharp and inquiring mind, and is a truly engaging soul.

          The Real Story of How Amazon Built the Echo A long piece by Joshua Brustein in Bloomberg about how the Echo came to be, and how it came to be a hit, despite pundits prognosticating sure failure.
 When it launched, Amazon’s critics jumped to mock the company. Some called it a useless gimmick; others pointed to it as evidence of Amazon’s Orwellian tendencies. Then something weird happened: People decided they loved it.

          Last night, Seattle Arts and Lectures unveiled some of the authors they’re bringing to town for their 2016-17 season. You can see the full announced slate on SAL’s site and buy tickets for most of the authors right now. It’s a big, splashy, ambitious list; all the authors are worth your consideration, but I’d like to highlight a few personal favorites that you might consider checking out when they come to town.

**Dear Cienna,**
Do you have any opinions on sexy-librarian porn? I&rsquo;m kind of flattered by the trope, but I also wonder if maybe it doesn&rsquo;t raise expectations to an uncomfortable level with my prospective girlfriends.

          Have you read Kelton Sears&rsquo;s profile of new-to-Seattle cartoonist Simon Hanselmann yet? You really should. It&rsquo;s a super-interesting introduction to a great (and newly local) talent. Hanselmann is signing his new Fantagraphics title Megg &amp; Mogg In Amsterdam and Other Stories at the Fantagraphics Bookstore and Gallery tomorrow; you should obviously go.
 Have you also read about the time Prince donated $12,000 to a library in Louisville because it &ldquo;was the first full-service free public library in the nation open to African-Americans?

It was kind of a boring new comics Wednesday from the mainstream publishers, so I decided to dive into the minicomics section of Phoenix Comics &amp; Games to see what local cartoonists are working on. Or, in one case, what local cartoonists were working on; I had never seen the 2014 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fanzine Notorious R.B.G. before, so it was new to me.
