          &ldquo;If you fear change, you’ll be horrified to learn that this new site is more than just a cosmetic improvement,&rdquo; is how they put it, before informing us that they are releasing their complete digital archive. Every single piece from their archive is available. Like The New Yorker, or Harper&rsquo;s, it comes at a price: a subscription to the magazine.
But, like always, their writer&rsquo;s interviews are available for free. It&rsquo;s one of the best online resources to learn from absolute masters of the craft, many of whom are now long dead, and have achieved the kind of mythical status that almost makes you surprised they ever were interviewable at all.

Dear Cienna,
I hate it. I wrote it in November, all 50-fucking-thousand words (and change, I made good time, thanks to bowing out of Thanksgiving with my fuck-you-we-won-you-beta-liberal relatives).

        <div class="content">
          The big problem with Wonder Woman, the reason why the character has had a hard time taking hold, is that DC Comics keeps restarting her from scratch. I can&rsquo;t keep track of how many times I&rsquo;ve seen the Wonder Woman character rebooted and relaunched. Sure, other DC mainstays like Batman and Superman tend to wallow in retellings of their origin stories, but those stories never seem to change as much as Wonder Woman&rsquo;s.

        <div class="content">
          The Hollywood Reporter got the scoop: Hugh Jackman and Fox 2000 are helping to bring Seattle author Sherman Alexie&rsquo;s popular YA novel The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian to a theater near you. Alexie, who has directed films in the past, will write the screenplay for the adaptation. Jackman will also play a supporting role in the film. This is a big damn deal for a book that has demonstrated remarkable longevity with young readers.

The youngest son of “Big Jim” Whittaker, the first American to climb Mount Everest, is also a mountain climber. Maybe Leif Whittaker can explain what the deal is with his bizarre family business — everybody knows the punchline “because it’s there,” but what really makes two generations of a family decide to climb mountains?

The catchphrase of The Furnace reading series is descriptive, intense, and memorable: “One Writer. One Story. Read to completion (with vigor).” It’s oddly sexual in tone — I can think of no other reading series in Seattle that is described with the same language as a handjob — but it’s exactly what you get when you show up for a Furnace reading.
Founded by Seattle writers Anca Szilagyi and Corinne Manning in 2012, the quarterly Furnace series has brought one writer to Hollow Earth Radio’s studios before a live studio audience to read a story that incorporates audio elements like music and sound effects.

        <div class="content">
          It&rsquo;s the beginning of book list season, which is a holiday that I must admit kind of befuddles me. I&rsquo;m not a list-maker. I find lists to be very unsatisfying. But many of you like them, and that is, of course, okay. I&rsquo;d like to direct your attention to two of the biggest lists of the season: The New York Public Library has published its list of the top books for kids and teens and the New York Times published their 100 Notable Books of 2016.
