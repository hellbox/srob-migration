          MONDAY Elliott Bay Book Company and the Hedgebrook writing colony join forces to bring novelist Parnaz Foroutan to Seattle to read from her novel The Girl from the Garden, an Iranian family drama. Gloria Steinem gives this one a rousing blurb: “A powerful and moving novel about the devastating choices women face when their worth is tied to their wombs but not themselves. Parnaz Foroutan takes the timeless themes of love, honor, sacrifice, and betrayal, and makes them new.

          This year, there was a lot of angst over the Hugo Awards, the science fiction awards given out as part of the Worldcon sci-fi convention. In brief: a bunch of asshole white dudes who think women and minorities are scary and gross tried to take over the awards because they believe everything, including sci-fi, was better in the 1950s. (You can read a longer explanation at Slate).
So after much hand-wringing and a whole lot of jackasses complaining about &ldquo;Social Justice Warriors&rdquo; online (an aside: if you&rsquo;re railing against people who fight for social justice, maybe you&rsquo;re on the wrong team?

Solitaire is a New York Times Notable Book, a Borders Original Voices selection, and a Nebula, Endeavour, and Spectrum Award finalist. Also, very exciting: a feature based on Solitaire production later this month in Australia.
Our sponsorships are not like you see on other websites. We&rsquo;re fighting back against horrible internet advertising by offering you something new to read, full chapters, without any weirdness, tracking across websites, or deliberate confusion.

Can you just tell me, once and for all, if Stephen King is a good writer or not?

Dear Dan,
My grandmother, a lovely woman named Roberta, used to ask me a question very similar to the one you pose.

[Jonathan Franzen wanted to adopt an Iraqi orphan to better understand the young](http://mashable.com/2015/08/21/jonathan-franzen-iraqi-orphan/) Franzen says his editor talked him out of this plan. This is the best case for editors that I have ever read in my entire life.

          Local writer Anca Szilagyi just published a list of resources for people who need affordable housing options in Seattle. Szilagyi says she thinks about affordable housing, in part, &ldquo;because I’m a writer with writer and artist friends.&rdquo; This is an issue we&rsquo;ve talked about before in the first installment of our Exit Interview series, and we&rsquo;ll be addressing it more in the future.
If you&rsquo;re an artist of any sort living in Seattle right now — or a bookseller, or a non-profit employee, or, really, anyone involved in the arts at all — rent is very likely at the top of your mind all the time.
