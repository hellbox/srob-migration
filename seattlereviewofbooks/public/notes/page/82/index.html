          If you&rsquo;re at all like me, you&rsquo;ve stood in a record store and felt a sick pang in your gut as you realized that you don&rsquo;t own a CD player anymore. Somehow — I blame hypnosis — computer manufacturers tricked us into giving up physical media in exchange for a few millimeters of laptop thinness. We&rsquo;re not buying CDs anymore, we&rsquo;re downloading our audio entertainment. And that goes for audio books, too.

          The Most Exclusive Restaurant In America Though exciting at first, this basement restaurant with a supposed years-long waitlist becomes gradually less legitimate the more you try to learn about it. Journalists can’t confirm celebrity visits and numbers don’t add up. Nick Paumgarten writes about his fifteen course meal with a stubbornly self reliant and secretive chef.
 If Damon Baehrel is in some measure a fairy tale, what, exactly, isn’t true?

        <div class="content">
          I first heard of Vice magazine while working at Borders. An achingly hip young man came into the store — it was the late nineties and my memory is foggy, but he was probably dressed like a rave had collided with a grunge music festival — and asked me if we carried Vice. I said I didn&rsquo;t know what Vice was. He explained that it was a cool free magazine distributed around major American cities, and that new issues disappeared as quickly as they arrived.

          You guys, I kind of hate myself for even writing this, but the new Flintstones comic book?
It&rsquo;s pretty good.
I know, I know. I&rsquo;ve complained at length about the way publishers have dredged up licensed properties for children and turned them into grim fantasias for psychically injured man-babies. But this is not that. This is something else again.
Let&rsquo;s be clear up front that The Flintstones, as a premise, has always been completely nut-bustingly insane.
