          She was perfect pitcher,
Cooled glass and ice center,
Crystal all her own bounty:
Solid hammer, extended bat broken
Cam, when is delicate fist
Worth more than peacock tailed
Beauty fanned against face?
She is not safe.
No one is safe
From the break.
Her grandmother was a witchdoctor
seafoam green eyes and muddy skin
the earth shook when she spoke
islands out of the sea, a place called home.

          Our thanks to sponsor Atelier26 for bringing the astounding book Funny-Ass Thoreau to our readers this week. The book, released officially on Tuesday the 8th, covers a side of America&rsquo;s favorite recluse not seen in his more famous writings.
There&rsquo;s a great sample on our sponsor&rsquo;s page, so we can back up this astounding statement: Thoreau was, indeed, a very funny man. But don&rsquo;t take our word for it, check out the book, and be sure to click through and pick up a copy if you like what you read.

Elliott Bay Book Company is not the city’s oldest bookstore — University Book Store is older, by over a half-century — but it is arguably our most iconic. Founded in 1973, Elliott Bay has changed ownership three times. The shop was founded and expanded in its original Pioneer Square location by Walter and Maggie Carr. When the Carrs retired, they sold the shop to Third Place Books owner Ron Sher in 1999.

          Elena Ferrante, Private Novelist Alexander Chee on Elena Ferrante&rsquo;s upcoming new book.
 The bar for every writer of fiction is that the novel is an invented thing. And yet each time we write, novelists are treated like spiritualists who rip off the grief-stricken &mdash; as though our inventions are some sort of hustle. _Surely you must have some experience like this: Tell us about it._ On tour for my first novel, a reader asked, _“How much of this is autobiographical?

The organizers of the APRIL Festival just sent an email out with some bad news: next year will be the final APRIL. And the final APRIL will be an abbreviated, single-day serving. But boy does it sound like a lot of fun: on Saturday, April 1st, they will host “an all-star Poet, Playwright, Novelist and Drag Queen competition, readings from our favorite authors, a mini book expo and more under a literal circus tent at Hugo House.

          We love to hear from our readers! Please send letters to the editor through [our contact form](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/).
**I was disturbed to read [Paul Constant’s editorial about Jack T. Chick]( http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/selling-mansions-in-heaven/). Much like Paul, I used the comics as a source of laughs. I use the word "disturbed" because the editorial points at a kind of revisionism that paints us, the kind of people that Jack T. maligned (a very broad category, I’ll admit), as being powerless subjects under him and our ironic consumption of his comics as acquiescence to his ideology.
