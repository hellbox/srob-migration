        <div class="content">
          Book shopping for teenagers can be daunting, but they make excellent gifts and provide plenty of opportunities to introduce young adults to new authors to love. Here are some recommendations of books both new and old for the 13-and-up crowd that are worth adding to your shopping list.
Daniel José Older’s fierce and fantastic heroine Sierra — Buffy has nothing on this young woman — takes on family history and the forces of darkness in the heritage-embracing Shadowshaper, while Robyn Loxley finds herself forced to take on the power-mad governor of Nott City after her family is attacked and she must run for her life in Shadows of Sherwood by Kekla Magoon.

        <div class="content">
          The bad news is that the film adaptation of local author Jonathan Evison&rsquo;s spectacular novel The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving has been changed. It&rsquo;s now The Fundamentals of Caring, a title that sacrifices specificity at the altar of sentiment.
But! Here&rsquo;s the good news: it stars Paul Rudd, so I will still be there for this movie whenever it opens locally. And here&rsquo;s the even-better news: it was announced last week that The Fundamentals of Caring will be the Closing Film at this coming year&rsquo;s Sundance film festival, a position of pride that indicates confidence in the quality of the film.

          MONDAY Your week begins with a splash: author and artist Molly Crabapple reads at Elliott Bay Book Company. Crabapple’s Drawing Blood is a memoir about art, journalism, and upheaval. It’s an absolutely gorgeous (and, by all accounts, beautifully written) book.
TUESDAY Hugo House hosts the Copper Canyon Press holiday party. A bunch of Copper Canon poets including Dean Young and Deborah Landau will read new work, and Copper Canyon staffers will introduce you to poets and books that could change your life.

Janet Wolfe was quite obviously a brilliant force of nature. But more than this, Margalit Fox practically re-animates her with luxuriant and vivid prose. What a joy to read. And you have my respect, Ms. Fox, since you can talk a copy-desk editor into letting you launch your piece with this graf:

That&rsquo;s why instead of blurbs and jacket copy alone, we offer you a full chapter to read from our sponsors. Just like in a bookstore when you pick up an unknown writer and take a look to see if you like them.

Rahawa also wrote this week [in the _Millions_](http://www.themillions.com/2015/12/a-year-in-reading-rahawa-haile.html) about her year in reading.

          Nancy Pearl at Town Hall is our official Sunday pick, but before you head there you should drop by Fantagraphics and say hey to Laura Knetzger, from 1-3pm. She&rsquo;s throwing a release party for Bug Boys.
Bug Boys is a compendium of the comic of the same name, and it is really marvelous. Head down for her official release party, pick up the book and give a local hard-working comic artist some love and sales.

          Awesome Seattle cartoonist Ellen Forney&rsquo;s giant portraits of hands have finally been installed at the Capitol Hill light rail station, which is (and I am pants-wettingly excited about this) set to open early next year. Tonight at 5 pm, Forney will be on hand at the station as part of the Capitol Hill Art Walk to sort-of christen the new artwork with hot beverages and a public party. If you&rsquo;re a Forney fan — as everyone who&rsquo;s read Marbles or I Love Led Zeppelin undoubtedly is — you should show up for this one.

        <div class="content">
          I&rsquo;ve said many times that I&rsquo;m not fond of year-end best-of book lists. Year-end lists, so far as I&rsquo;m concerned, are like junk food: they&rsquo;re enjoyable, but they&rsquo;re probably not worth the time you put into reading (or writing) them. If you&rsquo;re looking for what the Seattle Review of Books believes to be the books of the year, I&rsquo;d encourage you to look back through our Reviews section. Our co-founder Martin McClellan ingeniously constructed the Reviews pages to be something like browsing a bookstore.
