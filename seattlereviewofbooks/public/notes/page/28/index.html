Oh, those blinking sentinels. I guess I could have written this about the towers on top of Queen Anne, but there's something about the way these three sisters are clustered together atop Capitol Hill, just off Madison, straddling 17th, two on the West, one to the East.

          Conservative sci-fi troll Theodore Beale, who seemed dumb a few years ago when he tried to game the Hugo Awards but now appears to have been a tiny droplet in the imbecilic wave of white male entitlement currently cresting in the culture, is back at it. Beale is currently trolling sci-fi superstar John Scalzi by publishing a book with a very similar title and cover to Scalzi&rsquo;s new novel, The Collapsing Empire.

Dear Cienna,
Not so long ago, I went to a reading. It was an author who, back in his prime, used to be a bestseller. I still think of him as a big name.

        <div class="content">
          This morning, Capitol Hill Seattle&rsquo;s Kaylee Osowski reported that the Elliott Bay Book Company&rsquo;s building has found a buyer. According to present Elliott Bay landlord Hunters Capital, the new landlord wants to keep the bookstore as a tenant. They have not yet revealed the identity of the prospective owner, but they call them &ldquo;local&rdquo; and &ldquo;family-owned.&rdquo;
We have every reason to believe those claims: Elliott Bay has a long-term lease for the space, and Hunters Capital specifically sought them out as tenants back when the store was based in Pioneer Square.

**Friday March 24th: *The Idiot* Reading**
*New Yorker* writer Elif Batuman has only one other book to her name: a non-fiction account of people who are obsessed with Russian novelists. But her debut novel, *The Idiot*—about a Harvard freshman in the mid-1990s who falls in with some questionable Eastern European types—is earning praise from all quarters.

          I&rsquo;m quoted in this very good short sendoff for the APRIL Festival in this month&rsquo;s Seattle Met, by Darren Davis:  The party may be ending this year with a send-off event, but it leaves having made its mark on the local literary scene. “APRIL took readings out of bookstores and into bars, onto the street,” says Paul Constant of The *Seattle Review of Books*, who started noticing younger crowds at readings after 2012.

Michael DeForge’s new book Sticks Angelica, Folk Hero begins with all the elements of a classic comic strip. You’ve got the flawed main character, Sticks Angelica, a know-it-all chatterbox who, feeling underappreciated by society, moves to the wilderness to be alone. She fancies herself a survivalist: “I run twenty kilometres every morning. On days I don’t bathe, I rub flowers on my armpits.” And she claims to live the life of a folk hero, wrestling bears when she’s bored and devising homeopathic cures for hangnails.

Alternate Wednesday March 22nd: A Constitution for Economic Equality Reading
Law professor Ganesh Sitaraman has long advised Senator Elizabeth Warren on economic matters, making him a leading voice in the battle against economic inequality. Tonight, I’ll be in conversation with Sitaraman about his book, which could very well contain the key for Democratic victory in 2018.
