          We love hearing from our readers, be it through Facebook or Twitter or email. We just received a message from SRoB reader Sandra, who writes:
Thank you for your article about what is happening at the Library. It sounds like the "rebranding" is the tip of the iceberg of problems at the Library. How can we create change in the leadership at the Library, and get back to valuing reading and books?

          Our October Bookstore of the Month is a special one, because it’s a bookstore that will only exist in the world for one day. [The Short Run Comix & Arts Festival](http://www.shortrun.org/) will take place this year on October 31st at Fisher Pavilion in the Seattle Center, and for that one day, it will be the largest bookseller of independent literature, zines, and comics in the Seattle area. Every week this month, we’ll highlight a different Short Run exhibitor, to give you a better idea of the scope and breadth of the festival.

The quote was from a letter dated October 14, 2015 &dash; so, clearly a response to the lack of public support from the survey. We wanted to post the letter in full, so you can see what the arguments from the company driving the rebrand were.

          This Friday is your last chance to apply for the Jack Straw Writers Program, which this year is being curated by awesome Seattle poet and novelist Karen Finneyfrock. It&rsquo;s a great opportunity for writers at the beginning of their career:
Established and emerging artists working in any discipline or genre may apply to any one of the residency programs offered. Artists living outside of the Puget Sound region may apply, but should be aware that expenses for travel, lodging, etc.

        <div class="content">
          Had she lived, Sylvia Plath would have been 83 years old today. If you&rsquo;re in the mood, maybe stop by this Brainpickings post and listen to Plath share her thoughts on poetry. As for me, it&rsquo;s a sad occasion; I tend to spend the day thinking about all the work that never made it to the page.
If Plath&rsquo;s birthday reminds you of all the great writing by women that the world never got to read, I&rsquo;d encourage you to pick up Kate Zambreno&rsquo;s excellent book Heroines, which serves as a celebration of (and lament for) all the women of literature who have been forgotten, or undervalued, or unrecognized.

          Rushing toward the ocean tongue
Along the lip of land
I am what my friends feared
Grit traded in for grains of sand
My city soil scattered in Northwest winds
Twice despised for behavior unbecoming&mdash;
Unable to leave the cascade light
Unwilling to claim the shadowed coo of pigeon’s songs as my only note.

          Busy day here, at the Seattle Review of Books. First, we published a piece by Laurel Holliday, Library Board scrambles for special meeting on rebranding issue; City Hall reacts, looking at the board&rsquo;s apparent cold-feet over the rebranding effort.
Then, we talked to the man behind the rebranding effort himself, City Librarian Marcellus Turner, and made sure that he had a chance to defend his work, in his own words (which, to our ears, read like little more than corporate-esque non-speak).

        <div class="content">
          President Fujiwara and the Seattle Public Library’s Board of Trustees,
As Laurel Holliday reported for the Seattle Review of Books last week, public response to Seattle Public Library’s proposed rebranding campaign has been overwhelmingly negative. In fact, Holliday reports the response has been so negative that the board appears likely to kill the rebranding plan at or before their public meeting on Wednesday.
This is for the best. The rebranding was ill-considered, and it was presented to the public in an arrogant, unprofessional way.

          We&rsquo;re sponsored this week by a very unique book, by a very unique Seattle writer. Esther Altshul Helfgott kept a journal full of insight and poetry, as Alzheimer&rsquo;s first showed its affects in her husband Abe. Her book Dear Alzheimer&rsquo;s is a startling, humane, and insightful look into a difficult time.
You may know Helfgott from her long standing (25 years!) writers reading series It&rsquo;s About Time, held every second Thursday at the Seattle Public Library&rsquo;s Ballard Branch.
