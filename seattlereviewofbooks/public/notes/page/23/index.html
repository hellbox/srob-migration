        <div class="content">
          Heidi MacDonald at the Beat says that Sarah Glidden&rsquo;s Rolling Blackouts has won the Penn State University Libraries&rsquo; 2017 Lynd Ward prize. MacDonald says the prize is given to &ldquo;the best graphic novel, fiction or non-fiction, published in the previous calendar year by a living U.S. or Canadian citizen or resident. It’s definitely one of the most prestigious awards for a graphic novel given out each year.&rdquo;
We&rsquo;ve been talking about Sarah Glidden for a long time here on the Seattle Review of Books.

          Alec Baldwin reads from his new memoir Nevertheless at the Paramount tonight. It&rsquo;s sold out.
If you&rsquo;re thinking about buying Baldwin&rsquo;s memoir, you should know that Baldwin is openly complaining about the job his editors did on the book. Danuta Kean at The Guardian notes:
The 59-year-old actor has attacked his publisher HarperCollins, accusing the editors of poor proofreading. In his first post on a Facebook page set up to promote his new autobiography, *Nevertheless*, he claimed the published edition “contains SEVERAL typos and errors which I was more than a little surprised to see”.

Dear Cienna,
Everyone calls comics “graphic novels,” but a lot of great comics, like *Persepolis* and *Fun Home*, are non-fiction. So “novel” isn’t right. But some comics aren’t funny at all, and so “comic” books doesn’t make sense, either.

          Like so many of the best books, I found it hidden behind a couple outdated computer programming manuals in a Goodwill. It’s a tall, slim hardcover book with a torn dustjacket. The cover is a soulful color sketch of a tiny figure standing on a roof staring out at a cloudy night sky. It says in big letters at the top, The Man, and below that, in smaller print, the author credit: Raymond Briggs.

**Wednesday April 12th: * Krazy* Reading**
George Herriman was America’s very first cartooning genius. His strip Krazy Kat depicted more than just a love triangle between a cat, a brick-throwing mouse, and a canine police officer — it laid out the cartooning language that we still see in modern comics. Michael Tisserand’s biography of Herriman finally gives the genius his due. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, elliottbaybook.

        <div class="content">
          In July of 2015 on the website Very Smart Brothas, Damon Young wrote a blog post titled “Serena Williams Drinks, Bathes In, and Makes Lemonade with White Tears.” The next day, he published a post titled “White Tears, Explained, for White People Who Don’t Get It.” It seems that his original post about Serena Williams inspiring white tears had inspired some white tears of its own. Young quoted a white reader’s response to his article: “It’s disturbing how it seems many black people resent white people, when we all bleed the same color.
