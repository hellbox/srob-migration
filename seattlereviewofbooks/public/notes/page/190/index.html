          Over at the Theatrical Mustang podcast, I talked about the Seattle Review of Books with host Katie Woodzick. We also discussed diversity, why Seattle is such an amazing city for books, and the pleasure of not discussing Jonathan Franzen. I hope you&rsquo;ll give it a listen and then subscribe to Theatrical Mustang, which interviews all sorts of literary, theater, and musical types. Start with this interview with the wonderful Kathy Hsieh.

        <div class="content">
          MONDAY Our week begins at Elliott Bay Book Company, where the wonderful independent publisher Red Hen Press presents a group reading with Tom Janikowski,Amaranth Borsuk, and Patrick Milan. They’ll all read from their most recent titles. But this reading also features local author Elissa Washuta, author of My Body is a Book of Rules and, most recently, Starvation Mode. (You can read my review of the latter right here.) A reading from Washuta alone is reason to show up, but tonight you’ll get to see three other writers and support a fantastic small press.

        <div class="content">
          The big-hearted neurologist and author has died at age 82. If you&rsquo;d like to try one of his books, the obvious place to start is The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, although if you&rsquo;re in the mood for a novel, Richard Powers&rsquo;s The Echo Maker features a Sacks-like writer. (Some have complained about the way Powers treated Sacks, but I respectfully disagree; in fact, my way into Sacks&rsquo;s prose came through The Echo Maker.

          [No Country for Young women](http://incisive.nu/2015/no-country/) Erin Kissane on why she stopped reading fiction written by men, and movies with male protagonists: &ldquo;I just got tired.&rdquo;
 It’s not even that my politics quail at something I otherwise enjoy. I’m just stung and sad, and ashamed that I keep falling for the same trick. If a piece of fiction is made by and emotionally centered on men, chances are, it defaults to the belief that women are nothing but fuel.

        <div class="content">
          Through Sunday, our sponsor Robert James Russell is allowing us run a chapter from his upcoming western Mesilla, being released by Seattle&rsquo;s own Dock Street Press. It&rsquo;s a real treat, and one you won&rsquo;t want to miss.
 He unwound a piece of stained red cloth from around the upper part of his left thigh and he dropped the saturated tourniquet into a soaked pile beside him. He took two fingers and tore open his trousers and beneath the breach lay a bullet wound that fizzled deep, the skin encircling the wound lipped out as if it had been disturbed by some plated tremor deep below.

        <div class="content">
          &ldquo;Nearly every woman I know has either had an abortion or helped another woman get one,&rdquo; begins the latest post on local author Lesley Hazleton&rsquo;s blog. Hazleton is a brilliant writer, a fearless thinker, and a deeply compassionate human being, and in this post she puts all those qualities to the service of one important cause. Hazleton wants to &ldquo;break the weird veil of shame and secrecy that still hangs over the decision&rdquo; to have an abortion, &ldquo;even when abortion is legal.

This morning, local author (and, full disclosure, my friend and former coworker) David Schmader [made an exciting announcement](https://twitter.com/davidschmader/status/636965842761027585): he’s the new creative director at the [Greater Seattle Bureau of Fearless Ideas](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/teri-hein-it-lsquohurts-a-littlersquo-to-split-from-826-national/). The BFI is a nonprofit writing and communications center — until last year, it was [known as 826 Seattle](http://fearlessideas.org/) — that offers writing workshops, tutoring assistance, field trips, and other writerly pursuits for Seattle-area youth. Schmader has for decades been a beloved fixture in Seattle’s writing scene; you may know him from his brilliant solo shows, or his insanely fun *Showgirls* screenings, or his brainstorming classes at Hugo House, or his Last Days column in *The Stranger*.
