          If you haven&rsquo;t read this Guardian story by Alison Flood about the situation in Turkey, please do so:
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government used a state of emergency law to close the 29 publishing houses last week, along with a swath of newspapers, television channels, magazines and news agencies. According to the Turkish Publishers Association, the decree means that all goods, assets, rights, documents and papers belonging to the publishers will be transferred free of charge to the Turkish treasury, with no appeal to be made, and the prospect of further publishers being shut down in the future.

Dear Cienna,
**My entire life, I’ve suspected poetry to be a scam. People only pretend to understand poetry because they don’t want to seem like idiots. I’m right, aren’t I?

Last year, I wrote about Coin-Op, a wonderful comic series by the brother-sister team of Peter and Maria Hoey. The sixth issue of Coin-Op, titled “The Last Great Time,” was published earlier this summer, and it’s official: Coin-Op is the most wonderful new comic series you haven’t heard about yet.
When they’re not working on their comics, the Hoeys are animators and film buffs, and most of “The Last Great Time” is given over to an exploration of film history, in the form of brief comics essays about Luis Buñuel and Nicholas Ray, with guest appearances from Jimmy Stewart, James Dean, Lauren Bacall, Natalie Wood, Alfred Hitchcock, Jim Jarmusch, and many more.

          As I said yesterday, I am loving the newfound attention Colson Whitehead is receiving. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with Whitehead&rsquo;s work, this interview with Jennifer Schuessler of the New York Times is a great way to learn about him.
He mentioned a bookstore owner from the South who invited him to come down for “a frank talk about race.”
“I’m honored by the response to the novel, but I was like, ‘Can we just talk about the book?

          Jekeva Phillips is a force of nature. She’s a writer who also performs improv, and a couple years ago she created her own magazine, Word Lit Zine, from thin air. For her next trick, she’s devised her own three-day festival, Bibliophilia, which combines her love of theater and literature into a cross-disciplinary storytelling celebration.
Bibliophilia is made up of five events taking place on August 4th, 5th, and 6th at the Pocket Theater in Greenwood.
