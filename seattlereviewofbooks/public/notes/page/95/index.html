        <div class="content">
          Tobias Carroll at Vol. 1 Brooklyn writes that Dennis Cooper&rsquo;s lively blog has completely disappeared:
...late last month, Google deleted both Cooper’s blog and his Gmail account without providing any advance notice to him. Visiting the URL now brings up an error page stating that the page has been removed, and that “[t]his address is not available for new blogs.” Cooper is currently updating the situation on his Facebook page, though he does not have very much to report at the moment.

        <div class="content">
          Sponsor (and previous Seattle resident!) Sonya Chung&rsquo;s second novel, The Loved Ones is accruing a lot of interest before its publication date in October. The Millions put it on their &ldquo;most anticipated list&rdquo;, for example.
We&rsquo;ve got a nice long excerpt from the book on our Sponsor&rsquo;s page for you to read. We hope you&rsquo;ll like the book enough to consider pre-ordering it from your favorite store.
It&rsquo;s thanks to sponsors like Sonya Chung, and readers like you, that we&rsquo;re able to keep the pixels lit up here at the Seattle Review of Books.

        <div class="content">
          Every Monday remaining in the month of July, we’ll talking to Seattle-area booksellers about the books they’re most excited to read this summer. Events coordinator Nicole Lamb has worked at Wallingford’s Comics Dungeon for nearly five years. She’s especially interested in all-ages comics and comics with an LGBT angle, so when she’s asked about her favorite new summer comics, she can’t choose between her two passions.

First, Lamb says she’s excited that Boom Studios has finally released an all-ages comic called *Power Up* in a trade paperback format.

          Mother, Writer, Monster, Maid Rufi Thorpe’s article is a jarringly honest reflection on her attempt to reconcile art, motherhood, and marriage. It exemplifies the vulnerability that comes with good writing and reveals a litany of thoughts that open a window into the multifaceted life of an individual woman.
  For me, the conflict between motherhood and my life as a writer is not so much Brooks’ fear that art’s job is to unsettle, while a mother’s job is to make safe.

        <div class="content">
          I&rsquo;m already getting excited to introduce David Sedaris when he reads at Benaroya Hall on Wednesday, November 16th. (Here&rsquo;s last year&rsquo;s introduction.) If you&rsquo;re at all interested in attending this reading, you should know that tickets are on sale now, and they usually sell out very early. I attend a lot of readings, and I can tell you that Sedaris is the best reader I&rsquo;ve ever seen. He also sticks around and signs everyone&rsquo;s books before and after the reading, taking the time to have a personal conversation with everyone in line.

Dear Cienna,
**Some time ago, my local NPR affiliate stopped interviewing authors on a regular basis. They used to do author interviews practically every day, but now they’ll only feature a segment on a book once or twice a week, if I’m lucky.

A resident of Portland since 1959, Ursula K. Le Guin is an incredibly influential writer, particularly in science fiction and fantasy. She received multiple Hugo and Nebula awards, among many other distinguished honors — despite experiencing numerous rejections at the beginning of her career. Le Guin gained widespread popularity in the 60s and 70s with her short stories and Left Hand of Darkness, a novel pioneering the feminist science fiction genre.
