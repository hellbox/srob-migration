Charles Johnson has been one of the most influential members of Seattle’s writing community. He’s contributed to the community in a number of ways — as a professor at the University of Washington, as a writer, as a friend to writers. Johnson recently joined the writing and literacy nonprofit [Seattle 7 Writers](http://www.seattle7writers.org/), which donates to literacy organizations and donates books to readers around the region in shelters, detention centers, food banks, and other locations where people have need of good literature.

Nothing Tastes the Same Friend of SRoB Rahawa Haile returns to the Appalachian Trail, this time on a road trip with her father. Speeding from BBQ to buffet, they take the first small steps toward knowing each other after a ten-year hiatus and map the distance that remains between.

        <div class="content">
          We’re not quite halfway through 2017 yet, but I’ve noticed a very visible pattern to my reading this year: I’m not enjoying novels the way that I always have. It’s been a while since I’ve read a novel that has really blown me away, the way memoirs from Patricia Highsmith and Sherman Alexie did this year. No novel has wowed me with its ingenuity and energy and passion, the way Claudia Rankine’s Citizen did.

**Thursday June 15th: Writers & Poets of Washington State**
Western Washington poets Gary Lilley and Ann Tweedy team up with Spokane story author Erin Pringle and Spokane novelist Sharma Shields to bridge the divide and bring eastern and western Washington together at last. For one night, let’s pretend the mountain range, desert, and broken political discourse that separates us just doesn’t exist.

Live long and prosper Last night I dreamed, prosaically, that I was conversing with my oldest niece. My half-sobs kept trembling up to disturb the surface of our conversation; I excused myself to her by saying how much she looked like her mother, my baby sister, dead now four years.

Tomorrow, Tatiana Gill will release her new comic Wombgenda at the Fantagraphics Bookstore &amp; Gallery as part of the Comics &amp; Medicine Conference. Over the last couple of years, Gill has become one of Seattle&rsquo;s best, and most prolific, autobiographical cartoonists, and Wombgenda collects some of her latest work — most of it related to women&rsquo;s health, but with some current events mixed in.
The three long pieces in Wombgenda address Gill&rsquo;s journey to developing a positive body image, her abortion story, and an account of getting a new IUD at Country Doctor.

It’s a cold and rainy March morning in Pioneer Square, and two men in a dark suite at Clatter &amp; Din recording studios are chasing after a ghost. In the next room over, Sherman Alexie is reading his memoir, You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me, into a very expensive microphone. He’s recording the audio version of Love, which is set to be released in June, but the ghost hunt is getting in the way.
