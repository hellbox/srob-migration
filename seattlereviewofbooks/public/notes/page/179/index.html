          [Writing Better Trans Characters](http://www.strangehorizons.com/2015/20150928/1morgan-a.shtml) Cheryl Morgan offers guidance on writing trans characters on Strange Horizons. Her audience here is SF writers, but nothing in her advice should be limited to that genre. Any writer could benefit from this read.
 I reject the idea that trans characters should only be written by trans people because cis folk are bound to get it wrong. While there are some really fine trans writers, there simply aren't enough of us in the world to do what is needed.

          SRoB tipper Nick Hanover alerted me to this excellent Graphic Policy story by Janelle Asselin about former Dark Horse Comics editor-in-chief Scott Allie, alleging that Allie frequently engaged in &ldquo;out of control behavior while drunk and biting.&rdquo; Yes, biting. As in, his nickname around the office was supposedly &ldquo;Bitey the Clown.&rdquo; Allie was removed from his job this fall after he publicly assaulted two people at a convention, but rumor has it that Dark Horse Comics in specific, and the Portland comics scene in general, has been covering up for Allie for years.

I&rsquo;m a single dad and my ten-year-old daughter apparently found my copy of Story of O. She confessed after I found her posing Barbie over Ken&rsquo;s lap for a spanking.

          Jonathan Raban is the closest thing the Seattle literary scene has to a paterfamilias. His brilliant, incisive writing taught us how to think about the city around us, and he&rsquo;s influenced countless local writers from Lesley Hazleton to Charles Mudede.
Raban has been out of the spotlight for the last few years due to health-related issues, but I&rsquo;m excited to report that he&rsquo;s reading at the Frye tomorrow afternoon, from 3 to 4 pm.

          The APRIL Festival — it stands for Authors, Publishers, and Readers of Independent Literature — just launched a fundraising drive for their 2016 festival. A tremendous cast of local literary all-stars has put together a video for the project:
 This is a worthy cause. APRIL puts on a number of events — most of which are free — featuring a diverse array of artists. You should think about donating what you can.

        <div class="content">
          Most licensed comics, let’s be honest, are terrible. Comics as merchandising spin-offs are usually afterthoughts, completely irrelevant to the movie or TV show that spawned them. Nothing happens in licensed comics, and somehow the approval of a fleet of corporate lawyers makes the officially licensed spin-offs feel even more like bad fan-fiction. They’re safe and boring and bland.
But every so often you’ll encounter the proverbial exception that proves the rule.

          As a co-founder of the Seattle Review of Books, I am proud to publish Donna Miscolta’s piece about minority representation in the Seattle: City of Literature anthology. This piece is a perfect example of why my partner Martin McClellan and I created this site: to engage in conversation with books and with the city, and to help bring compelling pieces of writing to an audience that cares passionately about books.
