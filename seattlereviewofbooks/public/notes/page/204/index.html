          While everyone in Seattle is currently freaking out about Kathryn Schulz&rsquo;s excellent New Yorker article detailing how we we&rsquo;re overdue for an impossibly bad earthquake, I&rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to remind you to read Sandi Doughton&rsquo;s excellent Full-Rip 9.0: The Next Big Earthquake in the Pacific Northwest. Doughton gets into detail that the New Yorker simply doesn&rsquo;t have room for, explaining all the various fault lines and different kinds of earthquakes that could strike Seattle in specific and the Pacific Northwest in general.

          MONDAY: Elliott Bay Book Company hosts Seattle Times reporter James Neff, who debuts his new historical account, Vendetta: Bobby Kennedy Versus Jimmy Hoffa. This one’s got some good blurbs. Seymour Hersh says, “This is not a book about a good Bobby versus a bad Hoffa. It is a study of two men who always got what they wanted staging a shootout on the streets of Laredo. And, as Neff tells it, there were no winners.

          Kurt Vonnegut was mortified by the idea of being considered a sci-fi author. You have to understand, this was a different time, before Michael Chabon and Haruki Murakami and Kelly Link started blurring the lines between literary fiction and genre. The “science fiction” classification used to mean an author would be stigmatized to the gaudy corner of bookstores where only children and misfits would browse, so you can forgive Vonnegut a little bit of grumpiness over an imaginary distinction.

        <div class="content">
          The Guardian just published the first chapter of Harper Lee&rsquo;s second novel, Go Set a Watchman, on a page loaded with animation and &ldquo;ambient sound&rdquo; and an audio version of the text read by Reese Witherspoon. It positively reeks of overkill. And how&rsquo;s the chapter? As you may have expected, it&rsquo;s really not very good; some of the writing is painfully awkward.
“Hush, girl,” he said, holding her face in place.

        <div class="content">
          Speaking of comics, I barely pay attention to the news that comes out of San Diego Comicon these days because it&rsquo;s become a big Hollywood PR machine. But the SDCC news that DC Comics&rsquo; adult/creator-owned imprint Vertigo is launching 12 new titles this fall is very welcome. Vertigo used to publish wonderful comics series on a regular basis, but it&rsquo;s fallen into disrepair over the last decade or so. Some of these names — Darwyn Cooke!

          (Every comics fan knows that Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country. Thursday Comics Hangover is a weekly column reviewing some of the new books that I pick up at Phoenix Comics, my friendly neighborhood comic book store.)
The single best ongoing comic book right now is clearly Brian K. Vauhgan and Fiona Staples’s Saga. No other comic comes close to matching *Saga*’s inventiveness, progressive attitudes, and sheer storytelling energy.

          I reviewed Ernest Cline&rsquo;s sci-fi novel Ready Player One on its release. I didn&rsquo;t like it. The book&rsquo;s boundless nostalgia for 80s nerd culture unsettled me on a deep level; hating the book kind of felt like self-loathing. In retrospect, I admit that my review of the book wasn&rsquo;t very good — I couldn&rsquo;t convey what I disliked about Ready Player One because I was wrestling with the issue of my generation&rsquo;s nostalgia on a personal level.

          The only downside to covering the books beat is that you occasionally have to write a goodbye to a fantastic local bookshop. Miguel Otárola at the Seattle Times did a fantastic job of paying tribute to Cinema Books on Roosevelt.
