It’s easy to scoff at authors who complain about their book tours: oh, your publisher pays to fly you around the country to visit bookstores and meet people who are excited to see you? How horrible for you.
But in the new documentary Neil Gaiman: Dream Dangerously, the perils of a signing tour feel very visceral. In the span of three months, Gaiman estimates he has signed an average of three books for 50,000 individuals who have come to his events.

          The Short Run Festival announced their latest special guest: Hatem Imam, a cartoonist and editor who was put on trial in Lebanon for the &ldquo;crime&rdquo; of publishing two supposedly controversial panels in anthology comics. This New Yorker story has more information about the trial. Imam&rsquo;s appearance in Seattle this fall will undoubtedly kick off a citywide conversation about religion, censorship, and satire. Short Run is on November 5th this year.

        <div class="content">
          N.K. Jemisin’s 2014 short story “Walking Awake” begins with a very familiar power dynamic. In the opening lines a “Master” appears, “wearing a relatively young body.” The Master appraises some young, strong bodies, which we’re told will then be sent to the “transfer center.” It’s pretty clear within a few paragraphs that “Walking Awake” is a science-fiction take on the master/slave dynamic. Readers almost immediately get the sense that Masters subsume slave bodies entirely and live inside them, a surprising elaboration on the idea that anyone can “own” another human being’s body.

          Here, in two easy steps, is the secret to succeeding in Seattle:
 First, tell everyone you know about what you’re planning to do. Then, actually do it.  Number two is the most crucial part, obviously. Seattle’s writers and artists are drowning in aspiration; everyone has an idea of what they’d do with unlimited time and resources. They’d write a book, they’d start a citywide conversation about a topic that really matters to them, they’d build a community around a gallery or store or event.

          The fact that Elie Wiesel passed away on the same weekend that Donald Trump tweeted a barely coded anti-Semitic graphic from a white supremacist group was more than just unfortunate timing: it served as a reminder that we need writers and advocates and witnesses like Wiesel in our public sphere more than ever. He will be missed.
 The American Poetry Review just announced that Seattle author Jane Wong won the Stanley Kunitz Memorial Prize for her poem &ldquo;I Put On My Fur Coat.

          I have this notion that if you live long enough,
there are three or four great stories that you will have in your life.
A story of a journey or a transformation.
A story of love, which will likely mean the loss of love, a story
of loss. And a story of spiritual illumination,
which, for many, will probably be the moment of death itself,
the story untellable, its beginning and middle
