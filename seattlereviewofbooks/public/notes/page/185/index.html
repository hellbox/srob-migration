          JB Dickey happened to walk into the Seattle Mystery Bookshop on the day that they received their first order of books from late, lamented west coast distributor Pipeline in 1990. There were boxes everywhere. He made a deal with Seattle Mystery founder Bill Farley: “I traded him work for store credit” on that first day, Dickey says, and “a few weeks later, I ended up starting with him part-time so he could do other, non-bookselling things.

        <div class="content">
          I was so excited to report the Man Booker Shortlist names (and the attendant Seattle connection) yesterday that I completely failed to follow the advice of Seattle author Nicola Griffith: I didn&rsquo;t count the number of women&rsquo;s voices on the list. Luckily, Griffith did do a gender count, and she finds the results to be &ldquo;appalling.&rdquo; There are fewer women on the shortlist than usual, she says, and very few of the books are about the experiences of women.

          Wordnik is the largest dictionary in the world, if you count by number of words defined. They do things a little differently, not unlike an OED for the twenty-first century. They are a data operation, and on every Wordnik definition page you&rsquo;ll not only find the word you&rsquo;re looking for and its definition, but etymologies, related words by type, a reverse dictionary, and some amazing discoveries that come in through their programmatic tools.

        <div class="content">
          Today, local literary magazine The James Franco Review, which treats every submission as though it was written by James Franco, started rolling out an &ldquo;Emergency Issue&rdquo; on art and engagment. What does that mean?
Writers, editors, and artists around the country explored what it meant for them to be politically or consciously engaged in their work and to also examine literature’s relationship to safety. The first piece, by Nancy Jooyoun Kim, is live now, and it&rsquo;s powerful stuff, about her own experience with a white writer who workshopped a story with a black protagonist.

          And then there were six. Here&rsquo;s the Man Booker Prize shortlist:
A Brief History of Seven Killings by Marlon James
Satin Island by Tom McCarthy
The Fishermen by Chigozie Obioma
The Year of the Runaways by Sunjeev Sahota
A Spool of Blue Thread by Anne Tyler
A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara
The last two books are by American authors, a first for the Man Booker Prize. Of those two Americans, Hanya Yanagihara is considered a frontrunner for the prize.

that bear the scars around your own:
the elementary school that taught you
difference and its consequences; the law firm where twenty-five years later your daily
prayer and hijab reinforced the lesson.
There, the bus stop where you last saw
your brother, out of his mind and out of your
reach, his mouth an open sore.

          Catapult, a new publisher and online platform, launched today. (Yes, as the Wall Street Journal noted last week, it&rsquo;s funded by Koch money. Not that Koch money.) Their first print book is a short story collection by Padgett Powell, and there are plenty more on the way.
Everybody in the book business is very excited about Catapult for a number of reasons: first up, they&rsquo;re publishing a lot of great stories on the site for their first day, including one from Joy Williams.

And Arundel founder Phil Bevis still publishes books, both under the Arundel Press shingle and, more expansively, as Chatwin Books. (One of Arundel Press&rsquo;s titles, Nicole Sarrocco&rsquo;s Karate Bride, is a Seattle poetry classic.
