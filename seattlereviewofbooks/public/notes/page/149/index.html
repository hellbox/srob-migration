&mdash; Elliott Bay Book Co. (@ElliottBayBooks) January 8, 2016 This is not Clinton&rsquo;s first visit to Elliott Bay, though it is quite possibly his first since the store moved to Capitol Hill in 2010. Clinton visited Elliott Bay in Pioneer Square at least once while he was sitting president, and he did at least one signing there, for his (incredibly dull) memoir My Life.

        <div class="content">
          Each week in 2016 we are going to invest $20 in a Kickstarter project. On Saturdays, starting tomorrow January 9, we&rsquo;ll be reporting on the Kickstarter we back, and how the fund is going.
That gives us 52 Saturdays in 2016, so the fund is 52 x $20, or $1040. If a Kickstarter we back fails, we&rsquo;ll put that $20 into another project, allowing us to increase our pledges if we deem a project worthy.

        <div class="content">
          This afternoon, the APRIL Festival (it stands for Authors, Publishers, and Readers of Independent Literature) announced the schedule for their fifth annual celebration of small-press writing and reading, and it looks pretty goddamned spectacular. As previously announced, the writer-in-residence for this year’s APRIL is Jenny Zhang, a talented poet and wonderful essayist out of Brooklyn. Zhang’s star is on the rise, and her role as writer-in-residence will undoubtedly give the festival some national prominence.

        <div class="content">
          KUOW has the news that our state&rsquo;s poet laureate for the next two years will be Tod Marshall, a professor at Spokane&rsquo;s Gonzaga University. You can find an audio sample of Marshall&rsquo;s work on KUOW&rsquo;s site. You can also find more samples of Marshall&rsquo;s work at the ever-indispensible Poetry Foundation. &ldquo;Describe Turner to MLK&rdquo; combines a harrowing eye injury with race and history in a way that I&rsquo;m not sure is entirely successful, but it is certainly ambitious.

          Paul Tobin and Alberto J. Alburquerque’s comic Mystery Girl, now on its second issue, is an absolute delight so far. Here’s the little blurb at the beginning of each book that explains the premise:
Trine Hampstead knows everything. No mystery is too small or too weird for London’s premier sidewalk detective — and she truly knows it all, from your most personal secrets to the details of the deepest, most incredible conspiracies.
