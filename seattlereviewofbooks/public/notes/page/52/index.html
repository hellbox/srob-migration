        <div class="content">
          (Every Monday in December, we&rsquo;re asking a local bookseller which books they&rsquo;d like to receive for a holiday gift. Our final bookseller is Emma Nichols, who works at Elliott Bay Book Company and who also hosts the wonderful Drunk Booksellers podcast. Emma chose Atlas Obscura: An Explorer&rsquo;s Guide to the World&rsquo;s Hidden Wonders, by Joshua Foer and Dylan Thuras.)

I’m really into maps and so the name struck me. But it’s not a book about maps, it’s about weird places all over the world, and I’m very interested in the unknown and the strange.

        <div class="content">
          Did you hear the one about Robert Downey Jr, back when he was struggling with substance abuse? One night, all lit up on some combo of booze and pills and who knows what, he broke into a dark house, went into a little girl’s room, stripped down, and passed out in her empty bed. When the family came home they found him gently snoring. Imagine them there, in the doorway, the girl, the dad, the mom — maybe a brother — looking at this handsome movie star asleep in the bed.

        <div class="content">
          A reader wrote in to address an important omission from my piece that reviewed 2016&rsquo;s highs and lows. I did not, she wrote, mention Short Run even once.
And you know, that reader is correct. Short Run was fabulous this year, and I should&rsquo;ve mentioned it. This is part of the problem with year-end pieces, and why I&rsquo;m not fully comfortable with writing them: there&rsquo;s never enough room to make everything fit, things get forgotten, and then good people get their feelings hurt.

Shorter days are made brighter by clever short stories, both dark and sparkling. Nobody does a twist in the tale like O.Henry unless it’s Edith Wharton or Edgar Allan Poe. Or, try a more modern master via any of the stories in Roald Dahl’s un-fairy-tale collections for adults: Switch Bitch, Kiss Kiss, Someone Like You.

        <div class="content">
          Last week, I was thoroughly disappointed by a comic book that was supposedly about the enduring power of stories. This week, I’m entirely enchanted by a comic that demonstrates the empowering endurance of stories. Isabel Greenberg’s hardcover comic The One Hundred Nights of Hero is a story about stories wrapped in other stories, including a Scheherazade scenario in which a woman must tell a story so compelling that it distracts a lecherous man from advancing on her, night after night.
