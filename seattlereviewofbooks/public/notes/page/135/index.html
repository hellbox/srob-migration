          The New Web Typography Surely, you can picture them: the Penguin books with the colored covers, the little medalian at the bottom with the line-drawing of the bird logo? That design and layout are the work of the great typographer and designer Jan Tschichold. His most famous book, The New Typography, was a firebrand call from a young designer &mdash; one who later came to disown some of the more radical ideas he earlier held (I wrote about Tschichold, and how he got in trouble with the Nazis, and his relationship with Penguin in this essay).

        <div class="content">
          On the same weekend that Seattle Mystery Bookshop&rsquo;s GoFundMe campaign draws to a close, Wallingford&rsquo;s delightful Wide World Travel &amp; Maps — the oldest travel bookstore in the country — has launched their own GoFundMe campaign. They&rsquo;re looking to raise $30,000, and according to Shelf Awareness, Rick Steves&rsquo; Europe has donated a compelling travel package if the store hits its goals.
As I said when Seattle Mystery Bookshop announced their campaign, if crowd-funding isn’t your thing but you like to support independent bookstores, stop by Wide World Travel &amp; Maps — they’re at 4411 Wallingford Ave N — and pick up a few books to prepare for an upcoming vacation, or a trip that you hope to one day make.

**Dear Cienna,**
**The Little Free Library closest to my house is often full of crap. I&rsquo;m talking outdated programming books and collections of VHS tapes and other things that stay in the LFL for weeks and weeks because no one wants them.

          If you only read one group piece about a particular aspect of the publishing industry today&hellip;well, you should read the piece about the whiteness of the publishing industry that I linked to earlier today. But if you have time to read two group pieces about a particular aspect of the publishing industry today, you should definitely read this BookRiot interview with 12 translators about why they love translation.

          The Brooklyn Magazine piece about the whiteness of the New York publishing industry is a must-read, and not just because it prominently features friend of the Seattle Review of Books Rahawa Haile. Go take it all in.

          Two more to go. The 18th issue of Intruder, Seattle’s free, invitation-only comics anthology, is available around town right now, which means only issues 19 and 20 are left before the whole operation folds. Everything seems more acute when a countdown timer’s running, of course, so it’s hard to say for sure, but this issue of Intruder certainly feels more…Intruder-ier than ever before: thicker, full of a wider variety of comics, even livelier than usual.
