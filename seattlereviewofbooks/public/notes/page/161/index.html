        <div class="content">
          I mentioned this in Your Week in Readings, but I thought it could use a little elaborating here: the Saturday after Thanksgiving is Small Business Saturday, when consumers are reminded to turn their backs on malls and chain stores and online retailers and visit the stores that help make their communities vibrant, interesting places to live.
Even better, local independent bookstores are celebrating Indies First, a program (invented by Sherman Alexie) in which authors work as booksellers at their favorite bookstores for a day.

          A bee flew about the living room, then another, and more. They began to lodge in the African masks that hung on the walls. They clung to my lip. My house is infested, I thought, and opened the door to the outside. Bees covered the door’s lower half. I fled through it in fear, and in hope of finding help. In the living room, my father moved about with the bees, untroubled, unwilling to leave.

        <div class="content">
          The entire literary internet is currently exploding — in a good way, in a great way — over &ldquo;On Pandering,&rdquo; an essay by Claire Vaye Watkins at Tin House. She tells a story about a male author behaving badly, she talks about the institutional gender bias of the publishing industry, she tears some preconceptions down to the studs and examines what&rsquo;s left. It&rsquo;s angry, funny, shocking, intelligent and, in the end, hopeful.

Seats on 42nd Street subway Shuttle cars are [wrapped with symbols from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan](http://gothamist.com/2015/11/23/nazi_mta_subway_castle.php), intended to carry commuters into the alternate history of the Amazon TV series, *The Man in the High Castle*, in which the Axis Powers were victorious.
“Half the seats in my car had Nazi insignias inside an American flag, while the other half had the Japanese flag in a style like the World War II design,” said straphanger Ann Toback.

          Shelf Awareness reports that Bellingham&rsquo;s grand old bookshop, Village Books, has opened a new, 3,000-square-foot location in Lynden, a town just north of Bellingham. Between this and the new branch of Third Place Books in Seward Park that&rsquo;s opening in early 2016, it&rsquo;s time for the media to put away the tired &ldquo;bookstores are dying&rdquo; narrative for something newer, fresher, and more optimistic.

          MONDAY Elliott Bay Book Company kicks off your week in readings with an event that might improve your Thanksgiving dinner: Sommelier Madeline Puckette reads from her book Wine Folly: The Essential Guide to Wine tonight. If you ask nicely, she will probably tell you what wine goes best with turkey and stuffing.
TUESDAY At Town Hall Seattle, neuroscientist David Eagleman, who you most likely know from his PBS series about the brain, will be reading and discussing his new book The Brain: The Story of You, which aspires to “explore why we think and feel the way we do, and how the brain shapes nearly every aspect of who we are and what we perceive as reality.

Rachel Syme covers it all, in seven parts.
 Shot One: Open on a woman snapping a picture of herself, by herself. Maybe she is sitting at an outdoor cafe, her phone held out in front of her like a gilded hand mirror, a looking glass linked to an Instagram account.

          Our sponsor Grey Sun Press has put out this wonderful collection, Joy to the Worlds: Mysterious Speculative Fiction for the Holidays. On our sponsor page, we have samples from four of the eight stories in the book. All from fanastic local writers: Maia Chance, Janine A. Southard, Raven Oak, and G. Clemens.
They&rsquo;re going on a huge tour to celebrate this, starting with a house party on December 4th. And, if you&rsquo;re a Santa Bot stuck on a webpage somewhere, they&rsquo;ll be doing a Google+ event on December 5th, a Reddit AMA on December 18th, and in between, in the real world, you&rsquo;ll have a chance to see the group in Bellevue (12&frasl;6), Beaverton (12&frasl;11), Seattle (12&frasl;12), or Tacoma (12&frasl;13).
