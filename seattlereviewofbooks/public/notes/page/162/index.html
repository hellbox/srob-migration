          Jennifer de Guzman at Comics Alliance published an illuminating report on the high cost of drawing comics:
Being a comic book artist is a physically taxing job. Long hours sitting at the literal drawing board (whether drawing on paper or digitally) can strain muscles in the back, neck, and shoulders; repetitive motions inflame tendons in the arms. Combine this demanding work with the life of a freelancer, which, in the United States, does not come with any form of health care, and you’ll realize that many comics artists are living one injury away from economic disaster.

          How&rsquo;s your word count this week? If you&rsquo;re on track, you&rsquo;re at about 34,000 words. Get in extra this weekend to allow for padding over Thanksgiving (if you&rsquo;re American) because you deserve a day with family, food, and gratitude.
If you&rsquo;re behind, I still urge you not to despair. You are learning about yourself, and about your story, and you are writing more than you were before November, right? We are stepping on the right path.

Patti Smith talks about her new book M Train this Sunday at Town Hall. It’s sold out. If you didn’t get tickets, perhaps you could listen to Horses on repeat while watching Robert Having His Nipple Pierced. We do love Patti Smith.

        <div class="content">
          In what could very possibly be some sort of a record, Marvel Comics this week published three first issues of three different series starring superheroes who are women. Even better, all three of them are great fun. They’re classic superhero comics; compelling stories about conflicted characters in outlandish situations.
The Mighty Thor #1 establishes the new status quo for the title: Jane Foster, the character best-known as Thor’s mortal girlfriend in the film series, controls the hammer (and the power) of Thor.

YOUNG PEOPLE’S LITERATURE Neal Shusterman, Challenger Deep
POETRY Robin Coste Lewis, Voyage of the Sable Venus
FICTION Adam Johnson, Fortune Smiles
NONFICTION Ta-Nehisi Coates, Between the World and Me
Of course people have opinions about which books should have won. A lot of folks were pulling for Noelle Stevenson to win the young adult award with her comic Nimona, for instance.

          A Denver-area store called Isis Books & Gifts wants the world to know its name comes from the Egyptian goddess of healing and motherhood and it isn't run by terrorists. Isis Books &amp; Gifts has been vandalized five times in the last year, presumably because of, as Isis owner John Harrison told the Associated Press, &ldquo;some ignorant people believing that somehow the terrorists have a store, a gift store, in the middle of Denver, Colorado.

Yesterday, Seattle&rsquo;s own Fantagraphics Books formally announced Patience, the new graphic novel by Dan Clowes. It&rsquo;s the biggest original comic he&rsquo;s ever produced, and the description sounds fantastic:
*Patience* is an indescribable psychedelic science-fiction love story, veering with uncanny precision from violent destruction to deeply personal tenderness in a way that is both quintessentially “Clowesian,” and utterly unique in the author’s body of work. I&rsquo;ve always been a Clowes fan, but I think his best work skims the surface of genre — Ice Haven was a cross-disciplinary mystery novel, The Death Ray was a superhero comic riff.
