        <div class="content">
          John Jackson Miller at Comichron reports on some apparent upcoming changes to the New York Times&rsquo;s bestseller list, including the deletion of the graphic novel bestsellers. He continues:
Following an early report, I communicated with a contact who receives an advance copy [of the list] who noted there are further changes, including the elimination of the mass-market paperback charts and the merger of the e-book-only list with the fiction list. Other categories are reduced in size; the adult trade fiction list goes from 15 entries to 10, while the highest-profile list, the hardcovers, is cut from 20 entries to 15.

          Jack Kirby&rsquo;s Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth was my favorite childhood comic. I didn&rsquo;t know it was a ripoff of the first Planet of the Apes movie at the time I started reading my brother&rsquo;s old issues. In fact, I probably started reading Kamandi a full decade before the first time I saw Planet of the Apes. And while I love the Apes reboot films, I still prefer Kamandi.

          Roxane Gay&rsquo;s upcoming book, How to Be Heard, was due to be published next year by Simon &amp; Schuster. BuzzFeed reports that Gay has pulled How to Be Heard from publication because &ldquo;I can’t in good conscience let them publish it while they also publish [white supremacist] Milo [Yiannopoulos]. So I told my agent over the weekend to pull the project.&rdquo;
 Ten writers, including Seattle Review of Books columnist Nisi Shawl, are contributing sepculative dystopian short stories about the Trump administration to Slate.

          We get asked this a lot, and it is the nicest, most heartening compliment we can think of. We are not a non-profit, so we don&rsquo;t ask for your money.

          At some point, you have to figure, Jon Raymond will get sick of people comparing him to Raymond Carver. In reviews, the Portland-based author is said to “evoke” or hail “from the school of” Carver. Some reviewers even make the rare and fascinating observation that Raymond’s last name and Carver’s first name are — gasp — the EXACT SAME NAME. (Full disclosure, I very well may have made that Raymond-Carver comparison in past reviews; I’m too embarrassed to Google myself and find out.

Texas representative Bill Flores, chair of the Republican Study Committee, has released a Blueprint for a Balanced Budget 2.0 (PDF) that lays out a Republican plan for austerity under the guise of fiscal responsibility. It&rsquo;s a horrifying document, one that leaves the American people on their own while sustaining enormous military expenditures that amount to, by far, the largest defense budget on earth. So what gets cut? Programs that assist the poor, regulatory committes, and healthy school lunches (&ldquo;funding for the National School Lunch Program standards should be prohibited, returning control of students’ diets to their parents.

        <div class="content">
          Carolyn Reidy, the CEO at Simon &amp; Schuster, released a letter in response to the uproar that followed the news that a conservative imprint of S&amp;S was publishing a book by white nationalist Milo Yiannopoulos. The response (published below) is several weeks too late and it doesn&rsquo;t actually address the issues that many have raised about the deal.
Reidy assures readers that the book will not feature hate speech. This is, of course, beside the point.
