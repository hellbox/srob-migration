        <div class="content">
          The December issue of *Details* magazine will be its last, making the men’s fashion title the latest casualty of the declining print advertising market. While I&rsquo;m not going to shed a tear for Details — I haven&rsquo;t read a copy in at least a decade — this is not good news for writers. It&rsquo;s hard out there for freelancers, and only getting harder. Combine this with news that Gawker laid off writers yesterday in their ill-advised attempt to rebrand as a politics site and you&rsquo;ve got another step forward in the consolidation of an already-rough market.

        <div class="content">
          Ask Steve Winter how long he’s been in the bookselling business and he’ll tell you, “I’ve been saying 22 years for a couple years.” After a few short stints at bookstores in his native Michigan, Winter moved to Seattle and worked at Elliott Bay Book Company for ten years (where, full disclosure, he and I were coworkers) and at Third Place Books for eight years.
For the last two years, Winter has worked at Ada’s Technical Books for Ada’s co-owner Danielle Hulton, who claims less than a quarter of his bookselling experience.

James Bond films have never hewed too closely to Ian Fleming’s novels. Even the movies based directly on Fleming’s books, like Goldfinger, take many liberties with the plot and tone of the novels. This is perfectly fine; a movie is a movie and a book is a book. Bond films have developed their own language over the course of 50 years; they’re as distinct and self-referential as any film series in cinematic history.

          They felt the wind on the down of their necks.
After the murders, children in the town dreamed of houses
melting into the sky.
Fear built its hive inside them.
But as they grew
their memories dwindled
like their bicycles that became too small to ride.
The graves
lay buried beneath the trees’
shadows. Parents split
and moved away. One sister
survived. One witnessed the dark ceiling
of every midnight

          You may or may not be ready for the holidays, but it&rsquo;s never the wrong time to read a great collection of themed stories. This week&rsquo;s sponsor Grey Sun Press offers just that with Joy to the Worlds: Mysterious Speculative Fiction for the Holidays.
It&rsquo;s a season&rsquo;s worth of cross-genre stories revolving around the legends and trappings of the Winter season holidays, by four accomplished local writers: Maia Chance, Janine A.

        <div class="content">
          Last night, I had the pleasure of introducing David Sedaris at a sold-out reading at Benaroya Hall. This is the seventh time I've introduced Sedaris, and it's always a thrill. The best part of introducing David Sedaris is you get to hear him read after the introduction is done; he's simply the best reader I've ever seen. He'll be back in town next year on November 16th; I'll let you know when tickets go on sale.

          MONDAY Lyndon Johnson is perhaps the modern president who most lends himself to literary works. He’s appeared in Robert Caro’s ridiculously ambitious biographies, one of David Foster Wallace’s best short stories, and Robert Schenkkan’s incredible plays. But tonight, Betty Boyd Caroli looks at an under-appreciated side of the LBJ story in her book Lady Bird and Lyndon. Lady Bird Johnson could not have been a dull or unintelligent woman, but she’s gotten short shrift in most of the above-mentioned literary accounts.

          [Terror Strikes in Paris](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/terror-strikes-in-paris) Only one story today about Paris, because that is about all I can bear. But reactions that are neither hot nor takes, but explorations of deeply felt frustrations, help me to process the horror of Friday evening. I&rsquo;ve come to rely on Adam Gopnik&rsquo;s measured approach to tragedy, and his ever-apparent frustration with the violence he writes about for the New Yorker.
 Terrorism of this nihilistic order is hardly unknown in Paris.

          Our thanks to sponsor Donald Kentop. His book,Frozen by Fire, examines the 1911 Triangle Factory Fire in verse. Kentop will be appearing this Sunday, November 15th at 2:00pm, at the Ballard branch of the Seattle Public Library to read from this impressive work.
You can read two poems from the book on our sponsor page. We encourage you to support local poets and artists, and taking a moment to look on our sponsor page is one easy way to do that.
