          Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles good for slow consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also look through the archives.
The Fate of the Critic in the Clickbait Age This one&#8217;s close to home. Arts culture and reviews are on the decline as news publications go digital-first — criticism just doesn&#8217;t drive the clicks and pageviews that are the darlings of the modern editorial office.

        <div class="content">
          We&rsquo;re very sad to share the news that Edmonds poet Joan Swift passed away on March 13th. She was 90 years old. We&rsquo;ll share details of the memorial as soon as we hear them.
If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with Swift, I would encourage you to read this interview between Tania Pryputniewicz and Swift, which frankly covers topics including Swift&rsquo;s history of sexual abuse, and how her strength informs her work. She also offers her advice to young women who write, and discusses her time as a student of Northwestern poetry cornerstone Theodore Roethke.

A post shared by The Seatttle Review of Books (@seattlereviewof) on Mar 16, 2017 at 7:30pm PDT
 Last night, Mary Gaitskill delivered a craft talk at a Hugo House event hosted at Washington Hall. Gaitskill was mostly interested in the intangible elements of writing: that mysterious intangible known as &ldquo;style&rdquo; which creeeps in around the words and imbues the text with a meaning that is greater than the sum of its parts.

          This post was originally published in January, but we're re-running it because *Paterson* is making a return engagement for one week only at the University District's wonderful Grand Illusion Cinema, starting tonight. [Visit the Grand Illusion's site for screening times](http://www.grandillusioncinema.org/), and a little public service announcement: the Grand Illusion is cash-only, so hit up an ATM on the way. Also, in a total coincidence, [today is Transit Driver Appreciation Day](https://www.seattletransitblog.com/2017/03/17/today-is-transit-driver-appreciation-day-tell-your-driver-a-quick-thank-you/), so don't forget to thank a bus driver.

Dear Cienna,
In your opinion, what movie adaptation is better than the book it’s based on and why?
Caroline, Matthews Beach
Dear Caroline,
I'm currently loving *Black Sails*, which is not a movie but a pirate-themed series based on historical figures and characters from the children's book *Treasure Island*.

**Saturday March 18th: *Exit West* Reading**
Mohsin Hamid writes novels about the world as it is now. His books are structurally adventurous and tuned to provocative issues like immigration, racism, and the War on Terror. His latest novel is about a young couple finding love in a world overrun with homeless refugees and fearful xenophobes.

Can and can’t Many people say you can’t teach anyone to write. Just Google the phrase “Can’t teach how to write.” Half your hits will be refutations of the idea &mdash; which means half those discussing it think it needs refuting. Creative writing programs proliferate across the country, around the world, and all through the virtual ether &mdash; and yet they’re slammed by pros as too academic, too expensive, for dilettantes, for cowards, a scam to employ lazy and/or inept has-beens as teachers and enrich institutions catering to the dimwit dreams of talentless wannabes.
