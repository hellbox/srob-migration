        <div class="content">
          When it comes to Spider-Man, you&rsquo;re either a fan of the Ditko take on the character, or you prefer John Romita. Ditko, of course, created Spider-Man — with some assistance from Stan Lee — but Romita took over the series from Ditko and codified it into the Spider-Man we know today.
It breaks down like this: Ditko&rsquo;s art is weird and a little off-putting and gorgeous. Romita&rsquo;s lines are much cleaner and less complex and more outright heroic.

          We&rsquo;re throwing a short story writing contest based on our column Seattle Writing Prompts. Better yet, it&rsquo;s being judged by Matt Ruff, author of six novels. His most recent, last year&rsquo;s Lovecraft Country, is being turned into a series on HBO, produced by Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams. The grand prize is $100 and publication here in the Seattle Review of Books, and an interview to appear the same week as your story.

You probably know who the Koch Brothers are — those ridiculously wealthy tax-hating men who bankroll everything evil in the conservative agenda. But did you know that the Koch Brothers, as children, had a nanny who made them defecate on demand? Discuss that, and how they implemented their horrific agenda, in this month’s book club. *Third Place Books Seward Park, 5041 Wilson Ave S, 474-2200, http://thirdplacebooks.

No, Seattle doesn’t have a giant book festival. Some of our most insecure public figures — the kind of folks who actually lose sleep worrying about what people in New York City think of our quaint little town — consider the lack of a Seattle Book Festival to be a major failing of our literary community.
And while we still need someone to step up and fill the place of the recently deceased APRIL Festival, I wouldn’t think about trading the Short Run Comix &amp; Arts Festival, say, for a giant, corporate event.

          Because there’s a sparrow outside that appears to be dying.
Because I carry it with me, not the bird, but the emotion.
Because its feathers are wet, almost drenched.
Because not knowing what to do is my own purgatory.
Because nothing in the house is sugarcoated.
Because if you position yourself at the window you will see things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you don’t want to see.
Because there is a forest of coyotes and we keep finding the bones of fawns.

We&rsquo;ve just released sponsorship dates through January 2018. They&rsquo;re going fast, but there&rsquo;s still plenty of time to grab a slot.
Got a breakthrough book to promote, an amazing event, or a class or retreat that Seattle&rsquo;s active community of readers and writers should know about? We&rsquo;d love to help you get the word out.
Our sponsors get an exclusive presence, appearing on every page of the site for a full week, with a special mention on the home page and in our social media feeds at start and finish.

When Tasmanian cartoonist Simon Hanselmann moved to Seattle, he instantly became one of the biggest cartoonists in town. His Fantagraphics comic *Megahex* attained the kind of critical and commercial success that a very small sampling of cartoonists manage to achieve in their careers. Hanselmann is a natural provocateur — in the span of a half-hour interview, he manages to say four or five things that could get him in trouble on social media if taken out of context – but he’s so cheerfully sarcastic about it that you can’t help but feel warmly toward him.

A Pilot Explains Waypoints, the Hidden Geography of the Sky Pilot Mark Vanhoenacker&#8217;s description of the invisible landmarks used to map the sky is two years old, but we plead special dispensation — this is the time of year when Seattle&#8217;s skies are gloriously clear and bright, and the entire city&#8217;s in a dream of summer.
