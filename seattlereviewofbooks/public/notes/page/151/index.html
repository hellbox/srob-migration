        <div class="content">
          We&rsquo;re so excited about our first sponsor of 2016. Mineral School is an overnight artist&rsquo;s residency situated in an old elementary school in Mineral, Washington. It&rsquo;s in the foothills of Mount Rainier, an idyllic and perfect setting for an artist focusing on getting some work done. If two weeks dedicated to your writing in an amazing setting with delicious food provided seems like a dream to you, then you should get your application in as soon as you can.

 But the discussion reflects a broader truth: We live in an age in which machine intelligence has become a part of daily life. Computers fly planes and soon will drive cars. Computer algorithms anticipate our needs and decide which advertisements to show us.

          Every day, friend of the SRoB Rahawa Haile tweets a short story. She gave us permission to collect them every week. She's archiving the entire project on Storify. This is the last wrap-up, since the project is now over. We'd like to offer Rahawa a hearty congratulations on a big project nicely executed. We'll miss seeing the stories every day, but still have many to comb through, and even some to read again.

          Seattle cartoonist Tom Van Deusen’s newest book, EAT EAT EAT, is the latest entry in a long comics tradition: a humorous book about a feckless loser who doesn’t possess the self-awareness to realize that he is a feckless loser. It’s a somewhat proud (if self-loathing) lineage, stretching to Chris Ware and Ivan Brunetti from R. Crumb and Dan Clowes and on and on and on.
&lt; EAT EAT EAT is the story of a feckless loser named Tom Van Deusen (the indicia informs us that the book “is a work of pure fiction.

          A quick reminder: you can still sign up for the 6-week book reviewing class that Martin McClellan and I are teaching at Hugo House. We intend to discuss the purpose of book reviews, what it takes to make a book review into something more than just a GoodReads blurb or a boring plot synopsis, and the many different forms a book review can take. We&rsquo;re also going to get into some very important ideas: why responding to art is necessary, how to become a better reader, and why books are so important.

          Galleycat says:
Adolf Hitler’s anti-Semitic manifesto *Mein Kampf* has been banned from Germany for 70 years, but will return to German bookstores next month. So many factors are at play here — atrocity, history, copyright, the free exchange of ideas — that really all we can do is wait and watch what happens. Will German bookstores carry Mein Kampf? Will people buy it? What happens when the most hateful, reviled, and influential book in the history of a nation becomes readily available again?

I wake in a Spokane convent in my Black Watch

day of September 1996. I used to spring from bed
at the bell&rsquo;s first clang. Now there&rsquo;s
something wrong with the bedsprings
I cannot fix.
