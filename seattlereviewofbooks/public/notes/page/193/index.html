This summer, the Romanian city of Cluj-Napoca unveiled a new initiative designed to both promote literacy, and encourage residents to take advantage of municipal public transportation: From June 4-7, anyone reading on the city’s busses, trams or trolley, was be allowed to ride, entirely free of charge. What a great idea! I&rsquo;d love to see Seattle Public Library and King County Metro team up for something like this.

        <div class="content">
          Every comics fan knows Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country. Thursday Comics Hangover is a weekly column reviewing some of the new books that I pick up at [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/), my friendly neighborhood comic book store.
(Before we get started with the column this week, I just heard about this neat thing and I want to share it with you: The Ladies Comic Book Club, which is a comics book club for women, will be having their third meeting at Phoenix Comics tonight.

          SRoB has already declared what we believe to be the best-looking literary events of the week, but there are a couple of music-themed literary fundraisers coming up that we want you to know about.
Tomorrow night, the good folks behind Lit Crawl are throwing a 90&rsquo;s-themed dance party at Fred Wildlife Refuge, as a way to raise money for the (entirely free) Crawl. It&rsquo;s $5 at the door. As the invitation puts it:

Doug Nufer is freed by constraints. Nearly everything written by Seattle’s most valiant bearer of the Oulipian torch is born of one constraint or another; one narrative is told through the stultifying language of corporate biography, another is an homage to old Ace Doubles genre storytelling, a third is a story told only in negatives. His newest novel, *Lifeline Rule* is a conovowel text, which is a form in which every consonant alternates with a vowel.

          When you ask Debbie Sarow if there are any rules that Mercer Street Books customers should keep in mind when bringing their books in to sell to the store, she bristles. She has a few basic rules for books she’ll never buy — computer books, hardback books without dust jackets — but Sarow doesn’t like to discourage customers from bringing any sorts of books in, because “it’s the one book that they think is garbage that turns out to be the prize.

          Today&rsquo;s the day! Hugo House&rsquo;s fall registration period is open to the general public. Some courses to look out for: Sarah Galvin&rsquo;s class in drafting and editing poems; a yearlong prose manuscript class with Peter Mountford; a yearlong young adult class with Karen Finneyfrock; a one-day class from Maged Zaher titled &ldquo;How Not to be Yourself: Techniques of Othering;&rdquo; a class by Jonathan Lethem; and a class in novel-writing by Megan Kruse, whose debut novel knocked our socks off last month.

          Our sponsor this week is a real treat. Not only is Kelley Eskridge&rsquo;s Solitaire A New York Times Notable Book, a Borders Original Voices selection, and a Nebula, Endeavour, and Spectrum Award finalist, but shooting on a feature based on Solitaire begins later this month in Australia.
Read a full chapter here on the site. We give you great things to read in partner with our sponsors. It&rsquo;s our way of fighting horrible internet advertising.
