Every time I’ve visited in the three weeks that they’ve been open, the Seward Park branch of Third Place Books has been busy. The Raconteur café and restaurant in the front of the store is always slammed — it had to close for lack of food on opening day, which is a high-quality problem. And sometimes it’s hard to browse the books you want because someone else is already standing right where you want to be.

          Here Is The Powerful Letter The Stanford Victim Read Aloud To Her Attacker The letter that has taken the internet by storm. It&rsquo;s a stunning, heartbreaking, and brutal read &mdash; the judge in the case (who is up for re-election this year) gave the convicted rapist six months and probation, because a longer sentence would have &ldquo;a severe impact on him&rdquo;. As this letter so rightfully points out, the punishment doesn&rsquo;t come near to fitting the crime.

          The new documentary Finding Babel opens with the construction of a statue of the author Isaac Babel. Scenes of the statue being sculpted are intercut with an introduction to Babel’s grandson, Andrei Maleev-Babel. We spend the rest of the film with Maleev-Babel as he he travels the world trying to discover the truth about his grandfather’s past.
As Maleev-Babel follows his grandfather’s footsteps, Finding Babel unspools in a chorus of voices.

Last week, Marvel Comics published the first issue of a comic book titled Captain America: Steve Rogers by writer Nick Spencer and artist Jesus Saiz. At the end of the comic — uh, spoilers, I guess — the superhero Captain America is revealed to have always been a double-agent of Hydra, a super-villain analog to the Nazis. (You can read an explainer here.) People on the internet wrote a lot of posts and tweets and Facebook updates expressing their dismay about the reveal.
