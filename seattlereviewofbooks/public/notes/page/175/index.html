          (*Every comics fan knows that Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country.* Thursday Comics Hangover *is a weekly column reviewing some of the books I pick up at [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/), my friendly neighborhood comic book store.*)
The world ends in superhero comics all the time. DC Comics published a company-wide crossover called Final Night almost twenty years ago in which superheroes and their supporting casts believed their worlds were about to end for real (no, for really real this time).

          On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our third suggested itinerary:
If you&rsquo;re sick and tired of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; readings, where someone stands up and talks about their book for fifteen minutes, Lit Crawl&rsquo;s got you covered.

Our October Bookstore of the Month is a special one, because it’s a bookstore that will only exist in the world for one day. [The Short Run Comix & Arts Festival](http://www.shortrun.org/) will take place this year on October 31st at Fisher Pavilion in the Seattle Center, and for that one day, it will be the largest bookseller of independent literature, zines, and comics in the Seattle area. Every week this month, we’ll highlight a different Short Run exhibitor, to give you a better idea of the scope and breadth of the festival.

        <div class="content">
          Great news! Jamaican novelist Marlon James has won the booker for A Brief History of Seven Killings. Everybody I know who has read this book has done nothing but rave about it, and as this linked BBC article says: “The judges had come to a unanimous decision in less than two hours.”
Congratulations to James. If you’d like to know more about him — and his winning book — Jess Walter and Sherman Alexie recently talked to him on their podcast A Tiny Sense of Accomplishment.

You could attend a whole evening&rsquo;s worth of poetry readings at Lit Crawl with a nice mix of new, up-and-coming, and established names, providing an excellent cross-section of where Northwest poetry is right now.

He believes he may have found a record from Seattle&rsquo;s very first Library.

          To tell the truth, I have forgotten
which year goes with what.
My memory: as good as milk.
My family: spoiled through
and through. Pure as mold
on a September nectarine,
we refuse to announce defeat,
death. In this house, the margins
of mourning are tucked in,
pleated to the neck.
In August, my uncle dies
and no one tells his children.
He crosses his arms
in a blue suit in a coffin

        <div class="content">
          Since Shelf Awareness published the rumors that Amazon is preparing to open a bookstore in University Village, Geekwire has done a little digging into Seattle public records and uncovered blue prints for a space that &ldquo;will combine elements of an Apple store and a Barnes &amp; Noble, with areas for browsing books and checking out and buying new devices.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a huge space.
