          The following is an email we received from a reader named Joaquin de la Puente:
**A question for Paul Constant: I just read [your review of Josh Bayer's *Atlas* #1]( http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/06/08/thursday-comics-hangover-is-this-the-ugliest-comic-in-the-world/) and found it uninformed and irresponsible. You didn't seem to research this book or the line that it is a part of. The entire All Time Comics universe is written by Josh Bayer who is a lauded and prolific figure in underground comics.

          Yesterday, Seattle&rsquo;s outgoing Civic Poet, Claudia Castro Luna, announced the publication of her Seattle Poetic Grid. It&rsquo;s a map of the city, with site-specific poems interlaid over it. I encourage you to go check it out; there&rsquo;s lots of good stuff there, from classic seattle poems by Richard Hugo and Denise Levertov to newer poems by Julene Tripp Weaver (about University Village, of all places) and Elizabeth Austen and Lena Khalaf Tuffahha.

Thursday June 22nd: Resisting Trump&rsquo;s Shock Doctrine
Naomi Klein reads from her latest book, No Is Not Enough, and also will talk extemporaneously about whatever special hellish thing our president decides to do this week. Who can predict what that will be?

          The Seattle Urban Book Expo is happening on August 26th at Washington Hall. &ldquo;Last October, the authors and the people showed out and declared that black literature has a place in our community.

If you&rsquo;d like to get a table to exhibit at this year&rsquo;s SUBE, you should send organizers an email and follow the instructions on this post.

          We&rsquo;re so used to the modern incarnation of shooting coverage that we never think about how odd it truly is. Things always begin with reports on Twitter of gunshots, followed by dribbling pieces of &ldquo;news&rdquo; — some true, many false — from eyewitnesses and local news reporters. The body count goes up and down, depending on the source. Eventually, we learn about the shooter — always a man, usually with a domestic violence incident or two in his past — and people mumble about his motive and send their respects for the dead before their attention turns elsewhere.

          Amazon grew its book business in large part due to showrooming: ask any bookseller and they&rsquo;ll tell you horror stories of customers flipping through books, looking the title up on Amazon, and buying the book on their phone just before leaving the bookstore empty-handed.
But things have changed over the years. Amazon owns and operates several brick-and-mortar bookstores in cities around the country. They just bought Whole Foods. And so naturally they&rsquo;re getting concerned about showrooming, themselves.

          Henri had ‘no other teacher

then they scotch-taped me to the ceiling

Sponsor [Sagging Meniscus](https://saggingmeniscus.tumblr.com/post/157711883631/announcing-sagging-shorts) wants to make sure you've got this Thursday on your calendar: Seattle writer and poet Doug Nufer will be reading from his new book _The Me Theme_ at Gallery 1412. More details, and a link to the event, on our sponsor's page. You&rsquo;ve seen Doug&rsquo;s name plenty of times on the site. He&rsquo;s a formal constraint-based writer, making some of the most interesting, and compelling, and challenging (in the best possible way) work.

        <div class="content">
          At Literary Hub, Stacie Williams writes about what it means to be a librarian:
In 1962, British librarian Douglas John Foskett wrote a paper titled *The Creed of a Librarian: No Politics, No Religion, No Morals*, in which he argued that “the librarian ought virtually vanish as an individual person, except in so far as his personality shed light on the working of the library.” Neutrality has been enforced from the top down, with our policymaking professional organizations, down to individual librarians in their repositories, as a way of shifting the responsibility of moral judgement from librarian to patron.
