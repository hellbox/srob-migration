          For over a decade now, Maged Zaher’s poems have bounced between Cairo and Seattle. Somehow, he’s bridged the revolutionary Arab Spring-era Middle East and the banal tech-centric cityscape of Seattle, finding the uneasy common ground between revolutionaries and middle managers. His poems are about the world, but they’re also very specifically rooted in space; Zaher has written some of the most Seattle-y poems you’ll ever read—about our notoriously difficult dating scene, about our tech-bro culture, about corporate blandness encroaching into the arts.

          Abrams published a satire title for adults called Bad Little Children&rsquo;s Book, under the pseudonym Arthur C Gackley. It&rsquo;s a stupid work of faux covers that trade on 50s and 60s era children&rsquo;s book painting styles, mixed with inappropriate messages. You&rsquo;ve seen this kind of humor before &mdash; it supposedly pokes holes in societal norms, and, according to the marketing department, is &ldquo;edgy, politically incorrect parodies that speak to the bad little kid in all of us&rdquo;.

          Seattle, at the old World&rsquo;s Fair
He stands by the helm, his face full of blue
from the buildings at twilight, his hand
knuckled around a metal pole that keeps him
from falling, as he flies past the vaults
of startled mannequins, the red ohs of their lips.
Christmas lights are also falling
through the windshield, onto his chest:
right side green, left side red &mdash;
dark then back again.

          Lucia Perillo died on October 16 of this year. A MacArthur Genius who was shortlisted for the Pulitzer, Perillo was a poet of crafted precision, observation, and wit. John W Marshall, previous owner of Open Books, eulogized her for us, in this review.
As you probably know, we run an original poem from a local poet each Tuesday. Each poet recommends the next, in a chain that takes us places a call for submission never would: we travel on the tastes and friendships of poets.

Our sponsor this week is Nick K Adams, and his book _My Dear Wife and Children: Civil War Letters From a 2nd Minnesota Volunteer_ is a remarkable document. Adams has transcribed his great-grandfather's letters about going to war, and offered context and editorial notes to help explain his experience.
The letters span a number of years, from their author, David Brainard Griffin, signing up, through battles and the pain of missing a family when away at war.

          (Every Monday in December, we&rsquo;re asking a local bookseller which books they&rsquo;d like to receive for a holiday gift.

They&rsquo;re both by Nightboat Books, a publisher I&rsquo;ve only been aware of for a little while. They started with the collected poems of Tim Dlugos.
