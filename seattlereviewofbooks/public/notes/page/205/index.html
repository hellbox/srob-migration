The Seattle Review of Books will launch our readings calendar in the fall. (These things take time to do right!) But until that happens, every Monday we’ll highlight the best readings/literary events/talks/book clubs happening in Seattle — one event for each day of the week. (The above photo is of local author Doug Nufer and his dog. Nufer is on the right.)
Monday: The week opens on a promising note as Seattle’s literary godmother, Nancy Pearl, appears in conversation with the novelist Mary Doria Russell at University Book Store.

        <div class="content">
          A couple weeks ago, I visited the delightful Phinney Books for a reading. Customers at Phinney Books always have huge smiles plastered across their faces, and when you walk in, it&rsquo;s easy to understand why: from the categorization of books as either &ldquo;TRUE&rdquo; or &ldquo;MADE UP&rdquo; to the giant Ferris wheel along the wall of the kids&rsquo; section, the whole store seems designed to maximize happiness in humans.
In preparation for the store&rsquo;s upcoming one-year anniversary, owner Tom Nissley was talking up a neat new idea: he had recently purchased a Polaroid camera (or whatever they call cameras that take instant photos nowadays; Polaroid got out of the Polaroid business a few years ago) and he was taking photographs of Phinney Books customers holding their favorite books.

        <div class="content">
          This headline from Consumerist says it all: &ldquo;Amazon Will Reportedly Pay Self-Published E-Book Authors $.006 Per Page Read.&rdquo;
According to the *Guardian*, that means the payments received by authors could be as little as $0.006 per page read, estimating that if an author publishes a 220-page book each page would have to be read by every person who downloads the book in order for the writer to make the $1.30 they get under the previous pay-per-download payment system.

        <div class="content">
          The Hugo House has announced its 2015-2016 season, and it&rsquo;s a stellar lineup, featuring terrific big-name writers like Jonathan Lethem, Heidi Julavits, Dinaw Mengestu, Maggie Nelson, and Susan Orlean paired with some of the best local writers in the business today, including Maged Zaher, Sarah Galvin, and Sierra Nelson.
Novelist Peter Mountford took the helm as the House&rsquo;s curator a while ago, and this lineup feels like a manifesto. Or more accurately, as Hugo House prepares for a massive demolition and construction project, it&rsquo;s more of a statement of purpose.

        <div class="content">
          On some whiteboard at Scribd, there is a chart of the amount of reading a particular genre lover does, compared to the overall cost of keeping books of that genre stocked.
Romance readers found themselves on the wrong side of that line, by actually taking advantage of the service as advertised.

          If you&rsquo;re a writer who needs a little help getting a project done, take note: now is the time to apply for CityArtists Projects funding. There is a literary category. Go get some of that money and make something beautiful out of it.

          Seattle Mystery Bookshop has announced that their co-founder, William D. Farley, passed away on Sunday, June 28th, &ldquo;just three days short of the shop’s 25th birthday.&rdquo; Our thoughts are with the staff of Seattle Mystery Bookshop at what must be a tremendously difficult time. What a legacy, though! The store he helped found is keeping a proud tradition of Pioneer Square bookshops alive.
