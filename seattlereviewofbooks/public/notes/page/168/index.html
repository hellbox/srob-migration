          Looks like Amazon gave the Seattle Times the exclusive. Jay Greene reports:
At 9:30 Tuesday morning, the online retail giant will open will open [sic] its first-ever brick-and-mortar retail store in its 20-year life in University Village.
The store, called Amazon Books, looks a lot like bookstores that populate malls across the country. Its wood shelves are stocked with 5,000 to 6,000 titles, best-sellers as well as Amazon.com customer favorites.

        <div class="content">
          In this morning&rsquo;s post, I said there were way too many great events going on this week. I stand by that statement. Somehow, it escaped my attention that Seattle Arts and Lectures is hosting a Local Voices reading tomorrow night at Hugo House. No offense to Marion Nestle, who will undoubtedly put on a great reading at Town Hall tomorrow night and who is very knowledgeable about the scourge that is Big Soda, but the Local Voices reading should obviously have been the event of the night.

          Our thanks to this week&rsquo;s sponsor Entre Ríos Books. Their first release Twelve Saints is a beautifully done collaboration between poet Knox Gardner and artist Nia Michaels.
On our sponsor page, we&rsquo;re featuring the &ldquo;Saint Catherine of Alexandria&rdquo; with her matching image. It&rsquo;s a real treat, and we think you&rsquo;re going to love it.
They&rsquo;re throwing a book release party this Thursday &mdash; look at the sponsor page for more information.

If that doesn&rsquo;t grab your attention, I don&rsquo;t know what will. Kleine will be appearing with delightful Seattle author Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore, who will read new work.
TUESDAY Marion Nestle, who is a nutrition expert, reads at Town Hall from her book Soda Politics.

Increasingly, though, people are launching coordinated campaigns to push political and social agendas through negative reviews often only tangentially related to the product for sale.

          Our thanks to this week&rsquo;s sponsor Esther Altshul Helfgott. If you haven&rsquo;t had the chance to look through the excerpt from her book Dear Alzheimer&rsquo;s, you should do so now &mdash; it will only be up through tomorrow.
Helgott&rsquo;s journal of poetry and prose turned poignant when her husband Abe started feeling the effects of Alzheimer&rsquo;s. Her light touch, observational manner, and careful writing make this a moving journey. One full of life and discovery, despite the seriousness of the topic.

          &ldquo;Gay-romance novelist accused of plagiarizing straight-romance novelist.&rdquo; I mention this story in part because plagiarism is always fascinating — in part because it&rsquo;s always unnecessary. Why steal someone else&rsquo;s words when there are all these free words floating around our heads all day?
But this story is especially interesting: who was the person who reads both straight and gay romance who uncovered this plagiarism in the first place? I know they exist, and I think that&rsquo;s great, but what is the reading process like?
