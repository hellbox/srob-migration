        <div class="content">
          Yesterday, Book Expo America officially launched in Chicago. BEA is the biggest, loudest trade book show in the United States; it&rsquo;s when all the big publishers announce their biggest, splashiest projects and the industry looks ahead at the year to come. Publishing Perspectives just ran an overview of a report on the global state of e-books. And how are e-books doing? Not so great. In fact, the word &ldquo;stalled&rdquo; comes to mind.

        <div class="content">
          The illustrations in the new comic from Kaare Andrews, Renato Jones The One%, resemble Frank Miller’s artwork — particularly from his Dark Knight Returns era. Throughout, you&rsquo;ll find chiaroscuro layouts and plenty of exaggerated, pinched facial expressions. Andrews has bitten Miller’s style in just about every way imaginable. But Andrews’s art, once you look deeper than the surface, doesn’t really have any life to it; his art resembles Miller’s without the years of hard labor that made Miller such an icon.

          Over at my day-job blog, Civic Skunk Works, I wrote about last night&rsquo;s launch party for local labor organizer David Rolf&rsquo;s new book about Seattle&rsquo;s $15 minimum wage battle. The Fight for Fifteen explains how we embraced $15 locally, and many of the major players behind the wage increase — Councilmember Kshama Sawant, fast food worker Martina Phelps, and venture capitalist (and, full disclosure, my boss) Nick Hanauer — were on stage to discuss what they learned and what&rsquo;s coming next.

        <div class="content">
          Last week, you might recall that GiveBIG, the Seattle Foundation’s huge annual Seattle-area nonprofit fundraising drive, suffered from big problems. The new payment processor for the drive, an organization called Kimbia, completely failed, making it impossible for people to donate to their charities of choice. (Though GiveBIG is a local event, it is part of a national program called “Give Local America,” and many other regions reported the exact same troubles as Seattle.

          In the 1990s, feminists drew lines between a pair of up-and-coming magazines: in many social circles, you could either be a fan of Bitch Magazine, or you could be into Bust. Bitch was uglier than Bust, less glossy. Bitch was interested in feminist theory and it reviled the concept of selling out; Bust was more fun, more inclusive. Bitch had way more words per page, and fewer celebrity interviews. Bust got a fancy book deal and great placement on Borders’ newsstands around the country; Bitch was often tucked in the back of the racks, with the philosophy magazines and some of the weirder subcultural signifiers like The Comics Journal.

          Sherman Alexie, Seattle&rsquo;s most prominent author™, promoted his brand-new book for kids, Thunder Boy Jr., on Comedy Central last night. He talked with Daily Show host Trevor Noah about the problems of being a Junior, Crazy Horse&rsquo;s childhood name, Andrew Jackson, and the name of Washington DC&rsquo;s football team.    Speaking of Alexie, yesterday Seattle Arts and Lectures made a very exciting announcement via Twitter:  ANNOUNCEMENT: @Sherman_Alexie to curate &amp; host a new 3-part SAL series focused on authors he loves.

          Of the thousands of Devos, it was not so difficult to pick the ones that would make music.
&ast; There were at this time the castle-dwelling Devos, the confrontational Devos, the hundreds of philosophical Devos, and (up the stairs and to your right) the non-quiet Devos.
&ast; Terrible news was when some not-insignificant portion of Devos (the Cornish hen Devos, the table-setting Devos, the world-weary Devos) would at once disappear, Atlantis-like.

          Paige Cornwell at the Seattle Times wrote about how Seattle Public Schools doesn&rsquo;t fund its libraries.
In Seattle, the differences in libraries between have- and have-not schools are most extreme at the elementary level, with $28 per student separating the lowest- and highest-funded schools, according to the librarians’ survey.
The members of that group won’t say which schools are at the top and bottom because they agreed, as they collected information, not to reveal the schools’ names.
