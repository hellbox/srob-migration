        <div class="content">
          Yesterday we published our first report from our Public Diversity Editor, Vanessa Willoughby. As promised, we published it with minimal stylistic editing, all of which Vanessa approved before publication.
Why are we publishing a diversity report? It&rsquo;s a question worth asking again, and the answer is simple: either you think that the world is just and that the inequalities experienced in our society (or, more acutely, in the publishing world) by people of color, women, and LGBT people are because of their inherent lesserness, or you accept that bias and privilege are real.

          **Wednesday September 7th: Seeing the Light: Four Decades in Chinatown **
Dean Wong has devoted his life to recording the Asian-American experience through photos and words. His latest book, from Seattle-area publisher of beautiful books Chin Music Press, is a tribute to Chinatowns all over North America. Wong’s interviews and portraits capture the spirit of community that makes Chinatowns from coast to coast more than just neighborhoods.

          And so here we are, at the beginning of a shiny new fall. Fall is to the literary world what summer is to movie season: the season when the big names come out to play, when the big advertising budgets and media blitzes roll out. And every season, the books are accompanied with a certain amount of buzz—book chat, both positive and negative, from agents, librarians, and other literary folks with early access to review copies.

It’s a big day for astronauts and young writers; the Greenwood Space Travel Supply Company is finally reopening, about half a year after the gas explosion that tore up the heart of Greenwood. The Space Travel Supply Company is the retail front of the Greater Seattle Bureau of Fearless Ideas, which is a nonprofit organization that teaches young people how to communicate their ideas through writing, tutoring, workshops, and field trips.

          Almost half a year ago, we put out an [open call for a Public Diversity Editor](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/31/open-call-for-a-public-diversity-editor/). After fielding many responses, [Vanessa Willoughby accepted our offer](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/06/27/interview-with-our-new-public-diversity-editor/) to take the role. This is her first report. The demand for diversity in the publishing world has always been a priority for writers and readers of color. In the past few years, such misrepresentation has become a favorite talking point of media and industry figureheads alike without active solutions.

          Now that fall has arrived in Seattle again — I type this while wearing the first sweater of the season — it&rsquo;s time to start planning your literary autumn. And there&rsquo;s a lot going on this year; your schedule will be packed before you know it.
So I just wanted to draw your attention to a special event: The Cascadia Poetry Festival happens from November 3rd to November 6th at the Spring Street Center.

          Sponsor Maria Semple has a new book coming out, and people are really, really excited about it. For good reason! Everybody in Seattle read her last novel Where&rsquo;d You Go, Bernadette, and we want more.
Well, the Elliott Bay Book Company is hosting Semple on October 8th at Town Hall to launch her new novel Today Will Be Different. If you&rsquo;ve seen Semple speak before, then you&rsquo;re probably alaredy clicking through to get tickets.

        <div class="content">
          Mary Ann Gwinn at the Seattle Times pays tribute to the Washington Center for the Book&rsquo;s executive director, Chris Higashi. In her time at the Center and in conjuinction with the Seattle Public Library, Higashi has done more for reading and literature in this city than just about anyone. Now she&rsquo;s retiring. It&rsquo;s a lovely piece and you should read it.
Whoever takes Higashi&rsquo;s position will be facing down a tremendous responsibility: leadership at the Seattle Public Library has not demonstrated a commitment to books and readings.
