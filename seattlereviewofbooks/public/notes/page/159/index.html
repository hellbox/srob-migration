        <div class="content">
          In the December issue of the New York Review of Books, Doubleday executive editor Gerald Howard takes on reviewer Daniel Mendelsohn for his review of the Doubleday novel A Little Life. Howard&rsquo;s letter concludes: &ldquo;At bottom Mendelsohn seems to have decided that A Little Life just appeals to the wrong kind of reader. That’s an invidious distinction unworthy of a critic of his usually fine discernment.&rdquo;
This is not the only charge levied against this particular reviewer and this particular review.

        <div class="content">
          (Every Wednesday in December before Christmas, we’ll talk to a Seattle bookseller about the gift book they’re most excited about this season.)
Alex Gholz, bookseller at Third Place Books Ravenna, has eclectic tastes. His recent reading of James S.A. Corey’s Leviathan Wakes put him on a brief space opera kick — he’s right now reading Alatair Reynold’s Revelation Space, and after that he’s planning to dive into Seth Dickinson’s political fantasy novel The Traitor Baru Cormorant.

          Two housekeeping issues we&rsquo;d like to share with our readers:
 If you&rsquo;re a Hugo House member, you can now sign up for &ldquo;The You Review of Books,&rdquo; a book reviewing class taught by myself and Seattle Review of Books co-founder Martin McClellan. We hope to teach you how to communicate with art, how to be a better reader, and how to appreciate book reviewing as an art form. If you&rsquo;re not a Hugo House member, you&rsquo;ll be able to sign up for the class starting next week.

          The fifth issue of Seattle-based literary magazine the James Franco Review, in which every submission is treated &ldquo;as if we were all James Franco, as if our work was already worthy of an editor’s attention,&rdquo; is rolling out now. The first piece of issue five to see publication is a collection of poems from Aricka Foreman, including &ldquo;Monologues in Bars By White People With Good Intentions&rdquo; and the especially haunting &ldquo;Consent Is A Labyrinth of Yes.

        <div class="content">
          Last month, the Seattle poetry world lost one of its giants when Madeline DeFrees passed away. DeFrees was one of the most vibrant, evocative poets the Pacific Northwest has ever produced, and the Seattle Review of Books wanted to find some way to honor her life, and to bring her work to new audiences. Here’s one way to do that: every Tuesday for the month of December, we’ll present a DeFrees poem.

          Four-thirty, morning. Unearthly time
by nuns&rsquo; or any standard;
almost, this soggy May, monastic.
I close my door on sleep
for other sanctuary,
preceded by the birds
who long ago devised
their daylight saving.
Now, saving the daylight,
no other shape abroad
but the swinging step of rain
on rain-soaked turf.
Unbreakable as doom
five streetlamps watch me come
to keep my tryst.
Nailed each to a man-made cross,
usual as air,

          Our thanks to sponsor Chatwin Books, who wanted to make sure you were familiar with Nicole Sarracco. They&rsquo;re publishing her debut novel Lit by Lightning, and to celebrate that, we&rsquo;re running three poems from her 2004 debut book of poems Karate Bride.
Chatwin Books is a local affair, tackling ambitious publishing projects of high quality. Sarracoo is a unique voice, and Karate Bride is a great way to get to know her work before reading Lit by Lightning.

          Dianna Dilworth at GalleyCat writes:
A Wisconsin elementary school has cancelled the reading of a children’s book about a transgender girl after parents threatened to sue claiming that the reading would be a violation of parents rights. The book in question is I Am Jazz, written by Jessica Herthel and Jazz Jennings, and illustrated by Shelagh McNicholas. These bigoted parents need to understand that banning a book never works; it only results in more copies sold and increased interest.

          MONDAY Happy new week! I’m sorry to report that tonight’s reading with xkcd’s Randall Munro and Hank Green at Town Hall is sold out. Instead, you should visit Campion Ballroom at Seattle University for Jon Meacham. Meacham is an excellent presidential biographer, and his newest book is about George Herbert Walker Bush. Destiny and Power is a much-needed spotlight on the somewhat-reasonable-in-retrospect man who sired two dullards with presidential aspirations.
