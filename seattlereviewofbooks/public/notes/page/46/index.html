          Not everyone realizes this, but every single comics store in the United States uses the exact same distributor: Diamond Comics Distributors. The collected graphic novels can be purchased directly through the publishers or through book distributors, but if you want to sell the staple-bound monthly so-called &ldquo;floppies,&rdquo; you have to go through Diamond. There is no alternative. Diamond&rsquo;s last competitor, a distributor called Heroes World, was bought by Marvel Comics and then collapsed in the mid-1990s.

          On Snapchat, two reporters for brand-new news start-up Axios, Mike Allen and Jim Vandehai, interviewed President-elect Trump about his favorite books. The resulting exchange is reminiscent of Sarah Palin&rsquo;s most famous interview.

Well, you can see some of them over there. You can see some of them right over here. This is one that I just —

        <div class="content">
          Seattle’s edition of the Bushwick Book Club is named after a popular Brooklyn series in which musicians write original music in response to a popular work of literature. Since 2010, local singer/songwriters and bands have been gathering at venues ranging from the Century Ballroom to Town Hall Seattle to the Can Can to sing songs about books including Slaughterhouse-Five, The Dark Knight Returns, and Silent Spring.
The Bushwick Book Club works best if you’re familiar with the books that the artists are singing about, of course, but even without a working knowledge of, say, Pride and Prejudice, you’ll still enjoy a nice little live anthology of Seattle-area musicians.

Our sponsor Mineral School is in the midst of receiving applications for their 2017 fellowships. Let's see if any of these describe you: an early or mid-career writer of fiction, non-fiction, or poetry? A writing parent of a child under 18? A visual artist? There are residencies for you, spanning from full subsidized one-week stays, to two week residencies for the remarkable price of $425.
Oh, and they feed you.

A lot of great movies adapted from written works have been released over the last month or so. Silence is a complex and challenging and ultimately rewarding adaptation of Shusaku Endo’s novel about the demands and responsibilities of faith. Fences is one of the most harrowing family dramas I’ve seen in years, with career-best performances from Denzel Washington and, especially, Viola Davis.
But one original movie in theaters right now, not adapted from a book or play, is a surprising tribute to the importance of the written word.

          The only way out is not through (bone).
When in doubt, don’t just meat or martyr.
Before cutting off your hand to spite your captor, see if you can tip the jar. Sometimes, shoot it; when you do, aim for the gears.
If there aren’t any scissors, start a fire. If there’s room in the well, sardine.
Not every number is an incision, and not every rule is a law.
