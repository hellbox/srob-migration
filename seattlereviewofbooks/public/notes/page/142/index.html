        <div class="content">
          Quick: what’s the oldest bookstore in Seattle? Generally when you ask a Seattleite that question, they break into a blank stare for a moment and then respond, “uh, Elliott Bay?” But no. Elliott Bay Book Company turns an impressive 43 years old this year. But our February bookstore of the month, University Book Store, celebrated its 116th birthday last month. 116 years! You’d be hard-pressed to find anything in Seattle that old.

        <div class="content">
          The Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s Greg Bensinger quotes Sandeep Mathrani, a chief executive of a company that owns malls nationwide, as saying that Amazon could be opening as many as 400 brick-and-mortar stores in the US. It&rsquo;s just a rumor at this point, but it makes sense.
This, of course, is bad news for booksellers everywhere. University Book Store&rsquo;s manager Pam Cady recently admitted that the new Amazon Books in University Village has eaten into her store&rsquo;s profits, and other booksellers have expressed concern about Amazon Books opening near them.

          It would be an interesting time to be a writer in residence at the Hugo House; you&rsquo;d be there during the transition period between the old House and the new. Why not apply? You can find details at the very bottom of this page.

          Suppose it is February and there are writers writing at picnic tables in the park. Suppose writing leads us to this park. Suppose the rhythm of the afternoon sky courses through you, igniting relief and terror. Suppose you are hungry and light-headed while hoping to retrieve the faintest mark.
Suppose a writer has planted a score inside her mouth. Suppose the wind morphs that score into something fizzy and warm. Suppose everyone puts pens down at the same time.

          The wonderful Entre Ríos Books is back as a sponsor, with their stunning book Twelve Saints. The work combines poems about twelve saints with collages built from tintype photographs. The effect is somehow both ethereal and concrete, and aesthetically it is absolutely gorgeous. We have a sample spread on our sponsor&rsquo;s page. The book is reasonably priced, for such a beautiful work, and available at many locations in town, as well as on the Entre Ríos website.

          This weekend, G. Willow Wilson took a public stand against Marvel president Ike Perlmutter for donating $1 million to Donald Trump&rsquo;s weird pro-veteran charity thing. In her post on the controversy, Wilson made a joke about getting fired.
The next day, Wilson picked up an honor that definitely makes the case for her continued employment. Her Ms. Marvel comic won the Best Series award at the Angouleme International Comics Festival. It&rsquo;s the first Marvel comic to ever win the award.

          MONDAY Let’s start our week off with one of the last Works in Progress open mic nights at the Hugo House in its current location. Works in Progress has been going on for years now, and it will undoubtedly stick with Hugo House in their temporary location on First Hill, but there is a certain kind of magic to the Hugo House cabaret space right now, as awkward as it can be when there’s a full house.

          [Maximum Wage: Is technological progress dependent on extreme inequality?](https://howwegettonext.com/maximum-wage-3e21048fc107#.l42rwltna) I&rsquo;ve read many responses to Paul Graham&rsquo;s overly simple Economic Inequality essay. The best, I think, is this by Steven Johnson. Not only is he of tech culture, but he&rsquo;s willing to call out the things that are bad, as well as good. And he has an eye on a great truth of SF culture: it&rsquo;s not all money-grubbing venture capital bros.
