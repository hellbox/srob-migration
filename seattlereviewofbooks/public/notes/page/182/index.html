Last night, in a stately room beneath the downtown YMCA, David Brewster welcomed a few dozen people to Folio, the Seattle Athenaeum. Brewster has done a lot of introducing in his life as a Seattleite — he’s the founder of the Seattle Weekly, Crosscut.com, and Town Hall Seattle. But you could argue that he’s never tried anything as ambitious as Folio before.
Brewster offered a brief overview of the athenaeum concept: originated by Benjamin Franklin as a way to help alleviate the high cost of books, athenaeums were private libraries dedicated to the prospect of “mutual improvement” — places where people could come together to read, write, and discuss literature.

        <div class="content">
          Grant Morrison and Chris Burnham’s comic Nameless is on its fifth issue this week, but it wasn’t until this issue that the premise of the series really hit home for me: it’s Armageddon, only the asteroid is haunted. That’s about as high concept as you can get, and if Morrison is nothing else, he’s fundamentally skilled at high concept.
It’s a pity that Nameless didn’t start off very well. The story opened in media res, with a nameless dabbler in the supernatural — well, to be specific, his name is Nameless — being recruited to fend off the asteroid Xibalba.

          Last week, I gave a talk at Ignite Seattle about the state of Seattle&rsquo;s literary scene, Amazon, and the future of literature. Here it is:
 The submissions form for the next Ignite Seattle is now open; you can submit at any point between now and January 8th. I would recommend it. I&rsquo;m not going to lie: the Ignite format, with its ever-advancing slideshow and its no-notes rule, is very intimidating.

        <div class="content">
          It’s obvious to anybody who has worked with Kickstarter: they really do walk the walk. To their core, they believe in the ethos of creation, and that their platform is a good way to empower creative people to fund their projects. Or, as the case often is, to test their idea in a very functional way and see if it has any legs.
But if you think of Kickstarter as a place where people make ridiculous coolers, tech gadgets, or million-selling games, you probably missed this part of their mission.

        <div class="content">
          Alexandra Alter at the New York Times reports that e-book sales have slipped for the first time in recent memory.
Now, there are signs that some e-book adopters are returning to print, or becoming hybrid readers, who juggle devices and paper. E-book sales fell by 10 percent in the first five months of this year, according to the Association of American Publishers, which collects data from nearly 1,200 publishers. Digital books accounted last year for around 20 percent of the market, roughly the same as they did a few years ago.

          As I’ve gotten to know the staff of our September Bookstore of the Month a little better, I realized that [Seattle Mystery Bookshop](http://www.seattlemystery.com)’s greatest strength is in its recommendations. The staff is impossibly well-versed in the genre. So I thought I’d ask them for some recommendations for our readers, particularly those of you out there who would never normally consider giving a mystery a try. Thanks so much to Seattle Mystery Bookshop owner [JB Dickey](http://www.

This wasn’t a part of the SRoB haul, but we did take delivery of 550 books from the printers this weekend. For those of you who don’t work in publishing, here’s what 550 books packed on a pallet look like:

        <div class="content">
          Oyster, which trumpeted itself as &ldquo;the Netflix of books&rdquo; when it launched a couple of years ago, is closing down. (They were never able to resolve that most basic of questions: isn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;Netflix of Books&rdquo; a library?) But most of the Oyster team seems to be moving to Google Play&rsquo;s Books division.
Does this mean Google is about to launch an all-you-can-read e-book subscription service? Who cares? Probably. We&rsquo;ll find out eventually.

          Wow! Anyone who follows Between the World and Me author Ta-Nehisi Coates knows that he&rsquo;s an ardent comics fan, but I certainly didn&rsquo;t see this coming. The New York Times says:
...it seems only natural that Marvel has asked Mr. Coates to take on a new Black Panther series set to begin next spring. Writing for that comics publisher is a childhood dream that, despite the seeming incongruity, came about thanks to his day job.
