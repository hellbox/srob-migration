Alternate Wednesday January 4th: Contagious Exchanges
If you’re not attending a book club with the Seattle Review of Books and the Seattle Weekly, you should be at Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore’s queer literary salon series, which this month features two of the funniest writers in Seattle: poet/essayist Sarah Galvin and essayist/monologuist David Schmader.

        <div class="content">
          Last month’s Reading Through It Book Club was a great success, a night in which nearly a hundred Seattleites gathered to discuss an America that they felt they didn’t recognize anymore. The event — a coproduction between the Seattle Weekly, the Seattle Review of Books, and Third Place Books Seward Park — didn’t provide a whole lot of answers, but it did evoke important questions of class and race and intergenerational poverty.

          On January 1st, Sherman Alexie announced in a Twitter post that he was leaving Twitter. The tweet read, in its entirety:
Hey folks, I'm leaving Twitter because its negatives increasingly outweigh its positives. Thank you for the follows. Some speculated that Alexie&rsquo;s account had been hacked, but Alexie confirmed over email with the Seattle Review of Books that he decided to leave Twitter. His Twitter account appears to have been deleted (or at least deactivated) since that January 1st posting.

        <div class="content">
          Every week for the last year and a half, we&rsquo;ve presented new poems by Seattle-area poets. It&rsquo;s been a tremendous honor — we&rsquo;ve been proud to pay poets for their work, and to meet so many of the talented individuals who call Seattle home. We hope you enjoy stopping by the site every Tuesday morning to read a new poem. But because it&rsquo;s a new year, we thought we&rsquo;d try something new for our recurring Tuesday feature.

          Since you mention it, I think I will start that race war.
I could’ve swung either way? But now I’m definitely spending
the next 4 years converting your daughters to lesbianism;
I’m gonna eat all your guns. Swallow them lock stock and barrel
and spit bullet casings onto the dinner table;
I’ll give birth to an army of mixed-race babies.
With fathers from every continent and genders to outnumber the stars,

          We&rsquo;re taking the day off to enjoy our loved ones, and we hope you&rsquo;ll do the same. Tomorrow we begin a new year in earnest, with several fun new features and more on the way. But today, if you&rsquo;re looking for something to do, stop by Comics Dungeon in Wallingford for their annual year-end (and year-beginning) sale. Take it from me: there is no joy as pure as digging through a box of $1 comics and finding $20 worth of cultural artifacts to plow through on a cold winter afternoon.

          The Great A.I. Awakening This piece by Gideon Lewis-Kraus is a little late to the Sunday Post but is so darned good we can&#8217;t resist. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are an arms race in the tech sector right now. Most progress is incremental, but the breakthroughs — likeDeep Blue&#8217;s victory over Fan Hui — are both exhilarating and terrifying. Now Google Translate has another.
Epic geekery, global collaboration, and a translation of The Snows of Kilimanjaro.
