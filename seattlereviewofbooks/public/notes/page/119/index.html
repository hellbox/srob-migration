          Who would have thought? More people use public libraries when public libraries get more revenue. Maybe Seattle Public Library leadership should focus more on investment in the collection and less on pursuing an &ldquo;anti-book&rdquo; agenda?

          We told you about this a couple weeks ago, and thankfully sanity has prevailed:
The Tennessee House of Representatives failed Wednesday to override Gov. Bill Haslam’s veto of a bill to make the Bible the official state book.
Haslam, a Republican, vetoed the Bible bill last week, saying he felt the bill “trivializes the Bible.”

        <div class="content">
          Last week, I asked people to share their experience with this year&rsquo;s Emerald City Comicon. Over the last few days, I&rsquo;ve heard from local cartoonists, from comics professionals, and from people who attended the show as fans. From those conversations, a pattern has emerged.
People are, so far as I can tell, pretty happy with Emerald City Comicon, especially as compared with other large comic book conventions. In fact, the more conventions that someone attends every year, the more likely they are to appreciate ECCC.

          **Wednesday April 20: David Schmader **
It’s true that I worked with David Schmader for years at *The Stranger*, and it’s true that I’m proud to call him my friend. But there is a part of my brain — the part that tingles when it comes across a sufficiently beautiful sentence — that is still in awe of his writing ability. If you haven’t read his now-defunct Last Days column or seen his live *Showgirls* performance, you might think it’s hyperbole when I say that Schmader is the single funniest man I’ve ever met.

        <div class="content">
          The 2016 Eisner Award nominations have been announced — the Eisners are basically the Oscars of comic books — and Seattle is well-represented this year. Fantagraphics Books is the most-nominated company of the year, with a whopping 17 nods. (One of Fantagraphics&rsquo; most-nominated titles is The Eternaut, which I reviewed here at the Seattle Review of Books back in December.)
Other Seattle-area nominees include The Oatmeal&rsquo;s Matthew Inman, who was nominated for his strip &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Going to Be Okay,&rdquo; and G.

          Taking my knife to the sharpener
I had to ask my brother
how do I take a knife
to the sharpener
one chance not to ruin
the flesh of this tuna I wanted
to separate the head
and dissolve the eye into
powder on my tongue I said
something about a fire worried
about dying in a fire in this club
with these people she said
“Where I come from that isn’t funny”

          Hugo House has published a (PDF) Frequently Asked Questions sheet explaining what their last month of operations in the Capitol Hill building will be like. There will be a large party on May 7th in which people will be invited to write on the walls of the House, and there will be a Literary Series event on the 20th — the theme is &ldquo;The Writing on the Wall,&rdquo; cleverly enough — that is slated to be the final event.
