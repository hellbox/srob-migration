          A dark photo of Thomas Frank describing our dark political present at Town Hall Seattle.
A post shared by The Seatttle Review of Books (@seattlereviewof) on Apr 18, 2017 at 7:55pm PDT
 
“I apologize for standing up so high,” Thomas Frank announced from behind the podium at Town Hall Seattle last night. He observed that the audience members who gathered by the stage to ask him questions were forced to gaze up at him, as though he was a wizened old man sitting at the peak of a mountain.

        <div class="content">
          Good news! Now that all the allegations against Bill O&rsquo;Reilly have finally gotten public attention, Fox News has kicked the man to the curb, canceling his O&rsquo;Reilly Factor TV show. It&rsquo;s embarrassing that it took this long, but it&rsquo;s good to see that activism eventually pays off.
However. O&rsquo;Reilly is also a bestselling writer — or more likely, &ldquo;writer&rdquo; — of historical books. His books warp and twist history into something that is barely recognizeable, but they sell like the proverbial hotcakes.

**Wednesday April 19th: *The Book of Joan* Reading**
Portland novelist Lidia Yuknavitch is a Northwest superstar. Her prickly, gorgeous fiction is at recognizable and more than a little bit scary. (It’s scary in part because it is so recognizable.) Yuknavitch’s latest, *The Book of Joan*, is a sci-fi novel that retells the story of Joan of Arc in a blasted-out dystopic wasteland. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.

          It is probably no mistake that some of the best poets are translators. While translating poetry from one language into another is an impossible, thankless task — I’ve heard it described as performing open heart surgery with a chainsaw — it still teaches you to ask all the right questions.
Why did the poet use this word in that particular spot? Does a line break mean the same in this language as it does in the original language?

        <div class="content">
          A couple weeks ago, I listened to the podcast S-Town. It was exactly as compelling as you’ve heard — a story of death and crime and poverty and hatred and mental illness. Of course the story of S-Town is more complex than just what’s in the narrative— the way it’s told, the elements of the story that don’t appear in the audio, are part of the podcast’s puzzle-box fascination.
It occurred to me as I was listening to S-Town, though, that fifteen years ago, before the dawn of podcasts, the story almost certainly would have arrived in the form of a book.

          All the cell phone towers are pagodas
from the top floor through my near-sighted eyes—
blue, white, red shimmering houses
for ancient gods among the fir trees and dogwood.
They climb the hills to the cemetery, carrying
the voices of the living far above the lost
chatter of those already gone before us.
The words are like raindrops in a summer storm
here then gone, sadness borne away
over the continents.

        <div class="content">
          When news broke last month that Joan Swift had died, the Seattle literary community erupted in outpourings of grief. A shared sensation spread quickly around Facebook that something momentous had passed with her. At 90 years old, Swift was well-loved by many generations of Seattle writers, and she provided a direct link to the history of Northwest literature. She was one of the last living writers to learn directly from Seattle poetry godfather Theodore Roethke, and she shepherded generations of writers out of anonymity and into maturity.
