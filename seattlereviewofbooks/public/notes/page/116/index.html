        <div class="content">
          Superhero comics are supremely weird. What started out as a simple formula — every issue features a fight by page seven, a little bit of soap opera, and the beginning, middle, and end of a battle between good and evil — has now become a weirdly self-reflexive vocabulary that pretty much is only used to describe itself. Even as superhero movies have become the most popular genre at the multiplex, it’s hard to understand modern superhero comics without comparing them against years of knowledge of the genre.

          I just want to call your attention to what should be a magnificent book event tonight. Poet Kevin Young is giving a craft talk at the Hugo House starting at 7 pm. Young is one of the very best American poets; his last collection, Book of Hours, destroyed me with its raw depiction of grief. It&rsquo;s one of the best collections I&rsquo;ve read in recent memory. (You can read my review here.

Billie Swift knew she was heading toward a defining moment when she heard that John Marshall, the owner of Open Books, was planning to retire. Swift is on her way to completing the MFA at the Rainier Creative Writing Workshop at Pacific Lutheran University this year, and so she was already at a crossroads in her life. What did Swift feel when she first read Marshall’s email? “Panic,” she laughs over the phone, and an “immediate sadness.

        <div class="content">
          When the Mall del Norte branch of B. Dalton booksellers closed in January of 2010, CNN reported, the city of Laredo (population 250,000) became the largest American city without a bookstore. “The closest bookstore is now 150 miles away, in San Antonio, Texas,” wrote CNN’s Ed Lavandera. Laredo was likely just the first of many American bookstore deserts, as Barnes &amp; Noble continues to falter with every quarterly earnings report and rural retail zones get sucked dry by Walmart and Amazon.

Here's something I'm doing this summer: hanging out in a TOWER in the Fremont Bridge and writing about the bridge, the canal, the city, the original inhabitants of this land, the now-unseen world, and my personal relationships with other bridges. Thank you to the Office of Arts & Culture Seattle for giving me this amazing opportunity. I will be posting again soon to ask for stories to help me with this project.
