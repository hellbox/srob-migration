        <div class="content">
          We&rsquo;ve known for years that Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams is a dipshit men&rsquo;s rights activist. He compares women who want equal pay to children. He&rsquo;s said awful things about consent. He endorsed Donald Trump and praised his &ldquo;clown genius&rdquo; for a year before the election.
Adams may be a jackass, but he is not, strictly speaking, an idiot. He&rsquo;s kept his politics out of his comic strip, because he understands that people like Dilbert for its inane &ldquo;boy-oh-boy-bosses-sure-do-suck-am-I-right?

          There is 100 yards of string laid out in a straight line and every ten yards a flower sprouts from stone. The flowers are A. Red. B. Fuschia. C. Yellow. D. White. E. None of the Above. If a boy walks down this path and it is summer and he hums a song from childhood will he pick A, B, C, D or choose E? Will he smell D's metallic hook and think of how gardenias are loudest in the heat?

Sponsor Anne Mendel is here with a full chapter from her comically twisted and dark novel _Etiquette for an Apocalypse_. Set in Portland in 2020, Mendel gives us a future when humanity is falling apart. But is that any reason to set aside manners?
Read the first full chapter on our sponsor&rsquo;s page &mdash; we think you&rsquo;ll really enjoy it. Visit Portland in the near future, and learn all about survival in a high-rise condo during the apocalypse.

        <div class="content">
          You simply must read this New York Times story about a community in Oregon that voted to kill its libraries.
For generations in America, small cities like this declared their optimism and civic purpose with grand libraries that rose above the clutter of daily life and commerce. But last fall, Douglas County residents voted down a ballot measure that would have added about $6 a month to the tax bill on a median-priced home and saved the libraries from a funding crisis.

Cory Doctorow &mdash; father, skull-collector, multiple award-winning author, BoingBoing blog contributor, and revolutionary advocate for humankind's unrestricted internet access &mdash; appears in Seattle on Monday, May 15, to discuss his latest science fiction novel, _Walkaway_, with friend and fellow award-winner Neal Stephenson. But SRoB columnist Nisi Shawl got him to grant a phone interview first. The (lightly edited) transcription below mercifully does not reflect the technical and recording difficulties overcome; rather it allows you to revel in Cory's deep yet fast-paced flow of thought.

          It has been, to say the least, a crazy week. Locally, everybody is running for mayor. Nationally, our president&rsquo;s brain seems to be degrading at an alarming rate. So let&rsquo;s end the week with a piece of unabashed good news and a pair of excellent poems by Seattle poets, okay? Be good to yourself — and the moms in your life — this weekend. Spend a few hours at a bookstore.

        <div class="content">
          Yesterday, I wrote that comics and cookbooks go together as perfectly as bread and butter. I also pointed out that no publisher has put together a truly great, comprehensive comics cookbook. In comments on Facebook, though, a few readers pointed out that there are some more comics recipes out there for you to enjoy.
Chris suggested Tyler Capps&rsquo;s weekly comic strip Cooking Comically. I hadn&rsquo;t heard of this one before. Capps uses a blend of photography and comics to lay out his recipes.
