          **Wednesday June 14th: *You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me* Reading**
Sherman Alexie is Seattle’s most entertaining reader, the most famous literary figure from Seattle, and one of our finest writers. And tonight he’s launching the biggest book of his career — a memoir about his complicated relationship with his mother. This reading is sold out, but Town Hall often has standby tickets available at the door. *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave.

        <div class="content">
          Seattle is an international hub of the global and public health communities. Seattle also has one of the mightiest comics scenes in the country. In almost any other year, if you were to sketch out a Venn diagram of those two communities — medicine and comics — there would be very little overlap. But this year, Seattle is host to the eighth annual Comics &amp; Medicine Conference, an international celebration of the communication of medical issues in cartoon narrative form.

          Brooklyn Rail published a great interview with Seattle&rsquo;s own Stacey Levine:  I see novel-writing as an opportunity to ask dozens of questions. The question of self-“realization” is going to be among them, but I like to think a novel is a chance to throw dice that ask combinations of even broader questions. “What is the experience of being alone versus being ‘beside’ somebody else?” And smaller ones: “What is the best way to describe that one sensation?

          In the beginning, it was innocent. Just play. _Let’s mess with Mrs. Flowers’ mailbox!_ Fisher and Price asked me to spy on an old witch they believed lived alone in the woods. _Is her husband dead? Or does she just hate men?_ I wondered. I wondered if she would ever come out of her shack. They tried everything to catch a glimpse of her. Sometimes they fisted worms and mud inside the black hole of it, then pushed the hard red flag up in high salute.

Sponsor [Lori Tsugawa Whaley](http://loriwhaley.com), a third-generation Japanese American, was raised in a primarily Caucasian community and felt disconnected from her Japanese heritage. While exploring this ancient culture, she discovered a source of truth — the code of ethics known as *bushido*. Bushido means “the way of the warrior”; it is the set of chivalrous principles that governed the behavior of the ancient Japanese warriors known as samurai.
Lori Tsugawa Whaley brings these concepts to everyday life, showing through examples the kind of ethical and moral choices you can make when guided by principles.

          This morning, the folks at Seattle&rsquo;s own Gramma Press announced that they&rsquo;ll be releasing a new book from poet Anastacia-Reneé (who we published back when she was known as Anastacia Renée Tolbert) on July 1st. The collection, titled (v.), is described this way:
Using a reimagined alphabet, Anastacia-Reneé sets about taking on everything from love to cancer, monsters, growing up, growing into our bodies, and the ways in which even our bodies are not our own.

This weekend, the [eighth annual Comics & Medicine Conference](http://www.graphicmedicine.org/2017-seattle-conference/) will take place in Seattle. Registration is full, but the conference also hosts a number of programs at the downtown branch of the Seattle Public Library that are free and open to the public. The conference is bringing local and international cartoonists together to discuss the many ways that narrative comics about medicine can inform, entertain, and inspire the general public.

Methods Meehan Crist was skating in the wrong direction and missed the moment her mother fell, slamming her head against the ice and sending shockwaves through her brain. Crist&#8217;s essay about the slow discovery of the depth of the injury — and the gradual disintegration of her mother&#8217;s personality — travels loss, neuroscience, and the history of our understanding of the mind, the heart, and the self.

          Brendan Kiley at the Seattle Times writes about a new report from the city that offers &ldquo;30 ideas — some already in play — to shelter artists and communities of color from rapid development and skyrocketing rents.&rdquo; You can read a PDF of the report right here. If you&rsquo;re an artist or a lover of the arts who is concerned about livability in Seattle — in other words, if you&rsquo;re reading this site right now — it is your civic duty to read this report.
