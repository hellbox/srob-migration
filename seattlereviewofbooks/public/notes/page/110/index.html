Lindy West’s debut memoir, *Shrill* was published yesterday to great acclaim. I had to recuse myself from reviewing it for the *Seattle Review of Books* due to personal circumstances; I was Lindy’s coworker at *The Stranger* for three years, and she asked me to read *Shrill* before its publication. And so I know I’m biased, but I do love this book: I think *Shrill* is funny and honest and heartbreaking and empowering and meaningful.

        <div class="content">
          Our friends at Seattlish just broke the story of a class-action lawsuit filed against the owners of Emerald City Comicon for not paying their volunteers. (ECCC officially calls its volunteers &ldquo;minions,&rdquo; which is not a very good look; ECCC vendors and talent have complained to us about how &ldquo;demeaning&rdquo; that title is on multiple occasions.) Seattlish explains:
According to the suit, the volunteers are expected to work essentially as paid workers would — performing functions necessary to the operation of the convention — but aren’t required to be paid for their labor or their overtime due to their volunteer status.

Third Place Books managing partner Robert Sindelar possesses what might be the rarest talent in the United States today: He’s getting really good at opening new bookstores. Sindelar oversaw the creation and refinement of the gorgeous Ravenna branch of Third Place Books, which is an ideal neighborhood bookstore: not too big, not too small, and thriving at every hour of the day.
Sindelar’s at it again, this time in south Seattle: this Saturday, Third Place Books Seward Park is opening and, with its vaulted ceiling, copious natural light, and burnished-wood glow it’s a serious contender for the title of Seattle’s Most Beautiful Bookstore.

          It wasn’t that she wanted to be pretty.
She wanted the world to see her
as she saw herself.
She wanted to see herself.
That’s what my daughter tells me.
I watch her, high up on these rocks,
her arm extended in a welcoming gesture &mdash;
she invites the world in.
I hold my phone arm up
an echo of her greeting
and am horrified to see my face &mdash;

Wait a gosh-darn minute. That top one doesn&rsquo;t feel like a book. The weight is all wrong.

          From the AP:
South Korean author Han Kang has won the Man Booker International Prize for fiction with "*The Vegetarian*," an unsettling novel in which a woman's decision to stop eating meat has devastating consequences. Kang is the first South Korean author to be nominated for the Man Booker. The book was translated from the Korean by Deborah Smith.

        <div class="content">
          Sponsor Lisa Richesson has an incredible story to tell in her book White Lady, Black Sons, one that explains Seattle&rsquo;s racist past through her direct experience. Lisa, a white woman, had two children with a black man. One, when she was a teenager, was put up for adoption.
The first chapter of the book, which you can read on our Sponsor&rsquo;s page, goes back even earlier to the first time she became aware of race, and just what happened in her cloistered white Catholic community when she became friends with a young black girl.

        <div class="content">
          I came to Geek Love late in life — just a couple of years ago when I was 36, as I tackled edits on my own novel. I’d heard of Katherine Dunn for years, of course, but I was totally surprised by the weirdness in her work. Everything in Geek Love felt like a madwoman’s treasure hunt, complete with freaks, carnivals, flippers, Siamese twins, fetish strip clubs, and — yowzah — limb amputation.
