          Title Fight Tony Tulathimutte in the Paris Review on who gets to name a novel.
 The history of writers fighting for their book titles is extensive and bloody; so powerful is the publisher’s veto that not even Toni Morrison, fresh off her Nobel win, got to keep her preferred title for _Paradise_, which was _War_. (For her most recent book, _God Help the Child_, she favored _The Wrath of Children_.

        <div class="content">
          On Thursday, June 2nd, Seattle City of Literature, with support from Seattle’s Office of Civil Rights, will present the first of three free workshops on racial equity in the literary arts. This is important stuff; you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who argues that literature is anywhere near parity in its representation. In fact, we saw some high-profile incidents last year — the Seattle literature anthology, the ridiculous white dude who pretended to be a different race and then pretended it was a political statement — that reminded us of exactly how far we have to go.

For my thirtieth portrait for Portrait Gallery, I picked Seattle&rsquo;s own Lindy West. She has been everywhere lately: we reviewed her book, and Paul did this amazing interview with her. She was at Town Hall last night, but if you missed it, you can still catch her tonight at Third Place Books in Lake Forest Park before she&rsquo;s off to events around the country and in the UK.

          &ldquo;This is the weirdest thing that ever happened to me,&rdquo; Lindy West said from the stage at Town Hall last night after being welcomed by a beyond sold-out room — 1200 people — with thunderous applause. West began by talking a little about the writing of her memoir, Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman. &ldquo;A book, FYI, is eighty thousand words,&rdquo; she told the room. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of words.&rdquo; And it took months to write, many of which she spent &ldquo;in a bat-haunted cabin in Maine.

When we launched the Seattle Review of Books, we knew our sponsorship model was risky. It required training our readers that advertising doesn&rsquo;t have to be horrible, despite pretty much everything else you find on the internet.

        <div class="content">
          A month ago, I referred to the first issue of Heartthrob as “a very promising ghost story/heist comic.” At the time I was giving it a cursory mention as one of a fleet of new heist-themed comics. Now that the second issue of Heartthrob is out in comic shops, I can tell you that it doesn’t deserve to be shoved off into laundry list of trends. This is already shaping up to be a terrific comic book.
