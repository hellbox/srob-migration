        <div class="content">
          Before Cody Walker left Seattle to teach English in Ann Arbor, he was frequently described as a quintessential Seattle poet. Go to any open mic night and you’ll likely find some poet who doesn’t even realize he’s aping Walker’s schtick—an endearing blend of earnest and funny, formally inventive and respectful of tradition. For a time, Walker was a ringleader of the poetry scene, a funny and fun poet who was always willing to share the spotlight with up-and-coming Seattle writers.

          So billionaire Paul Allen has funded a very large and very successful art fair in Seattle. Nicole Brodeur at the Seattle Times just broke the news that next year, Allen is funding a very large music festival in Seattle.
So, uh, when is Paul Allen going to get around to funding a very large book festival in Seattle? Compared to those other two festivals, this one will be a bargain to put on.

          **Wednesday August 10: *Train to Bombay* **
In her native India, Jaina Sanga has published a novel and a book of short stories. Though Sanga writes in English, has lived in the US since 1980, and currently resides in Dallas, her books have never been published here. Elliott Bay has imported her books and is throwing one of her only US events here tonight, making this a unique moment in international literature.

        <div class="content">
          James Alan McPherson, acclaimed American writer and writing educator, died last month, at the age of 72.
McPherson is best known for his wide-ranging 1977 short story collection Elbow Room, which won the Pulitzer Prize. He had worked with and been mentored by Ralph Ellison, an author with a similar eye for the entrenched, neurotic small-mindedness of the American cultural landscape. But McPherson&rsquo;s characters, navigating between situations of generous-minded realism and stark absurdity, are conveyed with a warmth that&rsquo;s unique to him &mdash; even when he&rsquo;s skewering someone, it&rsquo;s with affection.

I’m an insomniac, it’s a lifelong thing. And lesbian. I’m sick when I say this, a little envious of a body that can fit through anything, a lifelong thing, steady hands but a little shaky otherwise, getting hurt in everyday ways, we joke about it, I’m sensitive. Growing up together it’s years of tangled up arms or conversations and no one touches me as an on my own grown-up but for hugs and comings and goings or across my hair when I’ve just cut it, I’ve grown all arms and head.

        <div class="content">
          When I was a kid, I loved George R. R. Martin&rsquo;s superhero anthology fiction series Wild Cards. It&rsquo;s hard to get superheroes right in prose, but Martin&rsquo;s dark and involved universe just felt perfect. (The comics adaptation of the books, as I recall, was terrible.) If you&rsquo;re going on vacation later this month and you like sci-fi anthologies, grab a couple Wild Cards volumes before you go.
Well, now that Game of Thrones has taken over the universe, a Wild Cards TV series is in the works.

          Sponsor Isla McKetta spent a year in Poland, and it was that experience, and having spent a previous year in Pinochet&rsquo;s Chile as a child, that made oppression a topic in the forefront of her mind. In her novel Polska, 1994 she explores that, through the eyes of Magda, who witnesses her mother&rsquo;s arrest and disapearance.
We have a long sample on our sponsor&rsquo;s page so you can experience McKetta&rsquo;s tightly wrought language and ideas.

While our August Bookstore of the Month, Secret Garden Books, does host plenty of events in its Ballard storefront, most of the events on its robust readings calendar can’t be attended by your average adult Seattleite. “What we do mostly with events is school visits,” Secret Garden’s events manager Suzanne Perry tells me. She calls the school events “one of my favorite parts” of the job, event though “we don’t publicize them and people don’t know we do them.

          A Terrifying Journey Through the World’s Most Dangerous Jungle The Darién Gap, an expanse of wilderness between Colombia and Panama, has seen countless deaths and disappearances. Snakes and guerrillas fill the jungle, but despite these perils, thousands of migrants from all over the world attempt to cross it in hopes of eventually reaching the US. Jason Motlagh faced the risks and trials of the journey leading up to and through the Darién Gap to document the experience.
