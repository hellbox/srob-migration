        <div class="content">
          Jarek Steele, the co-owner of St. Louis&rsquo;s wonderful Left Bank Books (no relation to Seattle&rsquo;s wonderful Left Bank Books), published a blog post about an anonymous letter he received in resopnse to a Black Lives Matter window display in the store:
There was no return address, and it wasn’t signed. It was a very short message on a note card telling us that we had lost a customer. In it, the person said we **stoked the flames of enmity between races and promoted division**.

          David Nakamura at the Washington Post reports the six books President Obama is taking on his 16-day summer vacation:
 Washington: A Life by Ron Chernow
 Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates
 All The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr
 The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert
 The Lowland by Jhumpa Lahiri
 All That Is by James Salter
  That&rsquo;s a pretty impressive summer reading list.

          (*Every comics fan knows that Wednesday is new comics day, the glorious time of the week when brand-new comics arrive at shops around the country.* Thursday Comics Hangover *is a weekly column reviewing some of the books I pick up at [Phoenix Comics and Games](http://phoenixseattle.com/), my friendly neighborhood comic book store.*)
First issues of comic series are tough. You have to establish a premise, introduce readers to at least one character to care about, and then give the readers a good reason to come back for the second issue.

          GoodReads just put up a blog post about the stunning success of Paula Hawkins&rsquo;s thriller The Girl on the Train. If you&rsquo;re into metrics, this will fascinate you. If you&rsquo;re a big believer in the power of reviews — as I am — it will affirm your worldview in a satisfying way. And that&rsquo;s what the internet is all about, right? Affirming your worldview in a satisfying way?
Also satisfying: the post&rsquo;s comment section, which is mostly full of people who, like me, thought The Girl on the Train was an unremarkable thriller.

          Port Townsend&rsquo;s Copper Canyon Press, which Sherman Alexie once declared at a reading was the best poetry publisher in America, broke a little book news yesterday at GalleyCat:
Copper Canyon Press will publish the English edition of a **new poetry collection by Nobel Prize-winning writer Pablo Neruda**. The Pablo Neruda Foundation announced the discovery of these 20 previously unknown pieces earlier this year. The book will be titled Then Come Back: The Lost Neruda.

Though Debbie Sarow never imagined herself as a small business owner, her days as a bookseller were punctuated with little fantasies about what she would do if she ever ran her own bookstore.
One example comes immediately to mind. “I decided early on that if I had my way, I would put the graphic novels next to the art books,” Sarow tells me. “Everybody puts the graphic novels next to the humor books,” she says, presumably because humor books are often profusely illustrated.

        <div class="content">
          Caleb Crain&rsquo;s piece for the Atlantic on Purity bears a salacious headline — &ldquo;Jonathan Franzen Strikes Again: His latest targets: web sleuths and feminists&rdquo; — but it&rsquo;s really just one of those pre-publication book reviews that kind of gives out way too much information about the book. You can expect all kinds of clickbait-y headlines in the next few weeks, now that Franzen&rsquo;s back in town.
Honestly, I haven&rsquo;t decided whether I&rsquo;m going to read Purity or not; there are so many great books by non-Franzens out there just waiting to be read, and I was underwhelmed both by Freedom and by Franzen&rsquo;s last Seattle appearance.

        <div class="content">
          For many years if you attended a reading in Seattle, you'd have a pretty good chance of running into [Kate Lebo](http://katelebo.com/) there. The author of *Pie School: Lessons in Fruit, Flour, and Butter* and *A Commonplace Book of Pie*, Lebo is a poet and an essayist who's read on pretty much every stage in Seattle. But unlike a lot of writers who only show up when they're on the bill, she's always been a full participant in Seattle's literary scene, too.

          We celebrated our distance from New York,
high-fived each other as our words
debuted in Open Books and Floating Bridge,
Elliott Bay, and the daze of The Typing Explosion.
That’s what they will call us you predicted
as we stood on the edge of Summit Avenue
near Broadway, The Seattle School, while the newfangled
streetlight wandered in and out of power.
We were younger then, with little idea
of poetry schools, just a sense of the work we revered:
