        <div class="content">
          I have written about how good the Flintstones comic is, but it has to be noted that the most recent issue, #8, is the best, most ambitious edition yet. It satirizes gender roles, economics, politics, and celebrity, and it also contains a great little story about how the ultimate goal of parenting should be to fuck the next generation up slightly less than your own.
My favorite part of the new issue is when a guest speaker named &ldquo;Thorstone Pebblen&rdquo; discusses &ldquo;a brand-new field of research called &lsquo;economics.

        <div class="content">
          You have to read Mary Ann Gwinn&rsquo;s final column in her role as the Seattle Times books editor. It&rsquo;s a grand and generous tour of the last 34 years in Seattle literary history. I&rsquo;m not going to pull a single quote here, because you should read the whole thing. (Full disclosure: I choked up a little at the shoutout to the Seattle Review of Books.)
But before we get too somber, let&rsquo;s note that Gwinn is not disappearing: she will contribute columns to the Times, she&rsquo;s writing about books for other outlets, and she&rsquo;ll continue to co-host Well Read on KCTS.

          If I had to choose one, and only one, writer to help me navigate the world for the rest of my life, my choice would probably be Rebecca Solnit. Solnit is a considerate, intelligent writer; sometimes when you read her essays you can feel your own brain changing and growing to accept new information about the world. And she’s also got the power to direct the very flow of popular culture; her essay “Men Explain Things to Me” is widely regarded as the source of the word “mansplaining.

This newspaper article, written exactly 36 years ago, marks the beginning of my immigration story. Those people in the picture are my parents and my sister. I am the one sitting, with my fists turned awkwardly in the foreground. When the photo was taken we had been in the US exactly 13 days. Before that we survived in a war zone.

          (After Soujourner Truth’s speech, Ain’t I a woman?)
There is so much turmoil in our country of late, something must be terribly wrong.
There is a man over there, who occupies the highest office in the land, who says immigrants are rapists, criminals, the worst kind of people.
I have never committed a crime, have paid taxes every year of my adult life, and have worked to earn an honest wage!

          Let me tell you about the place I come from, the ragged-road Texas
where every gas station means hot breakfast tacos wrapped in foil,
and every summer means brisket cooked so slow it falls apart,
because everything worth doing is worth doing slow
unless it’s driving, or sex,
both of which we do young and fast until someone stops us,
except for me, who starts driving late and starts dating never
