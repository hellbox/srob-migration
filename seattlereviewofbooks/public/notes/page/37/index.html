Well, you rendered [Northwest Associated Arts'](http://nwassociatedarts.org/) sponsorship useless by buying all the tickets to their Neil Gaiman event, so they kindly donated this week's sponsorship to a good cause: [Gay City](https://www.gaycity.org).
Did you know that Gay City has a 7,000 volume library centered around LGBT interest and focus? Please consider donating to Gay City to support their important mandate for supporting LGBT culture and health in our city.
Sponsors like Northwest Associated Arts make the Seattle Review of Books possible.

        <div class="content">
          In light of yesterday&rsquo;s news that Simon &amp; Schuster canceled Milo Yiannopoulos&rsquo;s book deal, Ron Hogan wrote a great Medium post explaining how book deals work. Short answer: Yiannopoulos likely made a lot of money out of this deal, free and clear. Go read the whole post.

Sunday Morning Sun&rsquo;s up
they say it&rsquo;s Sunday
come to us again
Bacon and egg smells
float over from Master&rsquo;s House
somebody&rsquo;s smoking cigars
maybe two somebodies
Cigars they come here
by big riverboats
breakfast china dishes
they come too
and ice for fancy get-togethers
Cost lots of money
Last Sunday
they traded Jubilee

        <div class="content">
          So it turns out that Simon &amp; Schuster&rsquo;s &ldquo;free speech&rdquo; defense of Yiannopoulos was total bullshit. When people complained about Yiannopoulos&rsquo;s racism and sexim, Simon &amp; Schuster was high on the free speech horse. But now that video has emerged of Yiannopoulos exercising his free speech about pedophilia, Simon &amp; Schuster runs away.
In other words, it was only when Yiannopoulos started spouting unmarketable speech that Simon &amp; Schuster got queasy.

        <div class="content">
          Tess Townsend writes at ReCode:
Two University of Washington professors are teaching a course to help students “think critically about the data and models that constitute evidence in the social and natural sciences,” according to the introduction to the course.
The 160-seat seminar, titled “Calling Bullshit in the Age of Big Data,” begins in late March and continues for roughly 10 weeks. Members of the general public can follow the course syllabus, including readings and recordings of lectures, at the course’s website.

        <div class="content">
          [Michelle Peñaloza](http://www.michellepenaloza.com/) has lived in Seattle for almost exactly four years. In that time, the poet and essayist — she’s the author of the chapbooks [*landscape/heartbreak*](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/book/9780692354841) and [*Last Night I Dreamt of Volcanoes*](http://www.organicweaponarts.com/product/volcanoes) — has become a ubiquitous Seattle literary figure, both on stage and in audiences at literary events throughout the calendar year. Peñaloza's announcement that she will be leaving town at the end of February sent a shock through the community.

          Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles good for slow consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that&#8217;s your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also [look through the archives](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-sunday-post/).
Keeping up with the Times This feels like the perfect week for Gabriel Snyder&#8217;s in-depth look at how the &#8220;failing @nytimes&#8221; is adapting to a rich but chaotic content environment.

 If you follow our Instagram account, you know that we&rsquo;re big fans of Little Free Libraries: the way no two libraries are the same, the way they all have different genres depending on the neighborhood, the way you can sometimes browse them for months without finding anything special but then without warning you&rsquo;ll find a book that will change your life.
