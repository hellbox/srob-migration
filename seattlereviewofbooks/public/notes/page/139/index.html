          From the fine folks at Publishers Weekly:
Bookstores sales rose 2.5% in 2015, marking the first time since 2007 that sales in the sector were up. According to preliminary figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau, total bookstore sales in 2015 hit **$11.17 billion, up from $10.89 billion in 2014**. To celebrate, let&rsquo;s visit a few bookstores this weekend, okay?

          Cienna Madrid is celebrating the long Presidents&rsquo; Day weekend by not offering any advice at all. Never fear: she&rsquo;ll be back next week with an all-new column. If you&rsquo;re desperately in need of a Cienna fix, may we humbly suggest you investigate the Help Desk archives? That&rsquo;s 25 weeks packed full of literary advice!

          We told you a couple weeks ago about Marley Dias, the student who, &ldquo;sick of reading about white boys and dogs,&rdquo; launched the #1000BlackGirlsBooks hashtag. Now, according to Vox, Dias&rsquo;s mission is complete: She has collected 1000 books featuring black girls as main characters, and is donating them to libraries in her school and to an elementary school in Jamaica. Here is Dias on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, discussing her project:    Here is a sentence that is full of awesome: Shoreline Community college students, inspired by a social-justice-themed science fiction anthology, are hosting a book drive benefitting Books to Prisoners.

        <div class="content">
          So this is a big deal: Hometown Heroes is a one-day, free, all-ages comics art show &ldquo;formed out of a desire to connect creators, readers, and the stories that bond them in a new way.&rdquo; It happens on April 8th from 6 to 11 pm at 1927 Events (1927 3rd Ave). I love Emerald City Comicon as much as anyone, but you can&rsquo;t really argue that ECCC gives as much attention to Seattle comics creators as it used to; the show has become a very big, very mainstream event.

Judy Blume is certainly somebody we don&rsquo;t need to say very much about, other than tomorrow is her birthday. Millions of kids learned about themselves, and their friends, neighbors, and siblings through her empathetic and big-hearted works. If she were here, we&rsquo;d say thank you Judy Blume!

          Mary Ann Gwinn at the Seattle Times offers an in-depth preview of Third Place Books&rsquo; new Seward Park store, which will open in late April.
 Seattle author Lesley Hazleton&rsquo;s upcoming book on agnosticism, Agnostic: A Spirited Manifesto, has earned two places of pride in the most recent issue of Publishers Weekly. Hazleton&rsquo;s book received a starred review praising &ldquo;her appealing voice and accessible prose,&rdquo; and it was also chosen as a most-anticipated book of the spring.

        <div class="content">
          Some of the best comics-minded thinkers — Grant Morrison, Kieron Gillen, Kelly Sue DeConnick — love to talk about comic books in musical metaphors. It’s an apt comparison; sometimes going to the comic book store and picking up a few comics is reminiscent of visiting the record store and walking out with a bag full of singles. They’re tiny bursts of art in an eminently consumable, commercial format, and they have their own aura of cool about them.

          This is not a drill:
The eighth installment of the Harry Potter series, the two-part play, "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child," will be published as a book this summer, author J.K Rowling announced on her Pottermore website Wednesday. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will be released on July 31st, which is canonically Harry Potter&rsquo;s birthday. Presumably, it will break all previous sales records for plays.

        <div class="content">
          Congratulations to Sherman Alexie, who is this year&rsquo;s Pierce County Library system selection for Pierce County Reads. The library chose five of Alexie&rsquo;s books for everyone in Pierce County to read. They are: The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven, Reservation Blues, Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, Flight, and War Dances. I wholeheartedly agree; everyone in Washington state should read all of those books.
 Seattle Arts and Lectures is hiring a Program Associate for its Writers in the Schools program.
