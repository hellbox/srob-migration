          Soaking up some wisdom from #SusanOrlean @hugohouse #crafttalks #writingstuff #seatown

Susan Orlean closed her talk at Hugo House by quoting something she said she'd hope to someday turn into a bumper sticker. "Writing is life. Approach your writing in the best way you can imagine approaching life. Ears open, eyes wide."
Kind of long for a bumper sticker, but not for a talk she delivered to a captivated crowd at Hugo House last night.

          A few weeks ago in her Help Desk column, Cienna Madrid responded to a question from Alyssa about tidying up the neighborhood Little Free Library. Today's Mail Bag is from an actual librarian. You can always read more of Cienna's columns on her archive page, and reach out to us if you'd like to comment on anything we publish.
 Dear Cienna &mdash; I greatly enjoy your column. Your advice to the person who wrote in about inappropriate stuff in the local Little Free Library and wanting to clean it out was right on, except for one aspect I disagree with: she should not tape a note to the LFL about her plans to clean it out.

        <div class="content">
          The first issue of novelist Chelsea Cain’s new Mockingbird series was published yesterday, and speaking on a strictly anecdotally basis the book seems to be garnering interest — late yesterday afternoon, Phoenix Comics was down to its last two copies. Which, considering this is a character who previously was best-known as a member of the West Coast Avengers, is some sort of a feat. The Mockingbird character — a SHIELD spy named Bobbi Morse — has recently earned some new attention thanks to Adrianne Palicki’s portrayal of her in the TV show Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD.

          “This is probably the best job in the world,” says Chris Gustafson, the school librarian at Whitman Middle School. “It’s so much fun, and what makes it so much fun is its biggest challenge.” Elementary school classes, she explains, are scheduled for librarian visits, while “no one has to come to the library in a middle school — it’s my job to make that happen,” to entice the students into visiting the library.

        <div class="content">
          We here at the Seattle Review of Books are very pleased to announce a new partnership: starting this week, you’ll be able to find our reading calendar picks and selected book reviews in the print edition of the Seattle Weekly. We’ve noticed over the last year or so that the arts writing in the Weekly, under the guidance of editor-in-chief Mark Baumgarten and culture &amp; commix editor Kelton Sears, has been getting better and better — new work from local cartoonists, the best music coverage in the city, and a focus on artists that no other media outlets in town are covering.

        <div class="content">
          Sad news: Jessa Crispin, founder of the popular book blog Bookslut, announced on Twitter that she&rsquo;s shutting down the blog after 14 years. Bookslut was one of the very first book blogs I ever read, along with the late, lamented Bookninja, and it was hugely influential for me. (I sent a terrible pitch to them when I was just starting out and, thankfully, never received a response.) If you&rsquo;ve never read Bookslut, I encourage you to go check it out; all the issues are archived, providing a kind of literary time capsule as far back as May of 2002.
