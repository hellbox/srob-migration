          You may have noticed a new style of sponsorship on the site today: event sponsorship. Our inaugural partner for this is the Seattle Antiquarian Bookfair, an annual rare books and ephemera festival now in its twenty-eighth year. Read more about the fair, and mark it in your calendars: October 10th &amp; 11th — and thanks to them for sponsoring the site.
We’ve been asked a few times — how are the sponsorships going?

        <div class="content">
          Over the last two days, we’ve seen a lot of outrage on local social media over the Seattle Public Library’s rebranding. You can see what SPL is considering through their survey, where they’re “seeking public comment on a proposed new name and logo design.” The name change would be to “Seattle Public Libraries,” and the logo design would involve either a few patterns that are apparently loosely based on the windows of the downtown branch of the Library or a series of connected dots.

        <div class="content">
          MONDAY Your week begins at University Book Store, where Fran Wilde reads from her new fantasy novel Updraft. It’s set in a world “built in towers of living bone” and stars a main character who has the “ability to control the invisible predators that roam the skies with her voice.” That sounds entirely bonkers, and is therefore worthy of our respect.
TUESDAY Elliott Bay Book Company brings Joy Williams to town for what they acknowledge is a “rare” visit.

          Looking for some Sunday inspiration? Maria Dahvana Headley, author most recently of Magnolia, wrote a seventeen tweet mini-essay on women’s agency in the arts. It’s personal, professional, gives good advice, and is about something near-and-dear to our hearts: writers being self-aware and claiming the time and space they need to create the best works they can.
The whole thread is worth your time, but here are a few highlights that caught my eye:

She starts a fake Karaoke truck, and manages to establish online credibility without too much effort.
Mark my words: reputation online is the battleground of the future. Trust is the key component.
For $5, I could get 200 Facebook fans, or 6,000 Twitter followers, or I could get @SMExpertsBiz to tweet about the truck to the account’s 26,000 Twitter fans.

        <div class="content">
          Collins died in Los Angeles today, the cause was breast cancer. It’s hard to imagine a single person selling as many books, reportedly 500 million copies of her 32 novels, as she did. The younger sister of actor Joan Collins, she made a career of the scandalous, covering romances, dalliances, deceptions, and desire. Apparently, Vanity Fair once called her “Hollywood’s own Marcel Proust”, which seems as good as a compliment as anybody could ever hope to carry.

On this page, you&rsquo;ll find dozens of ways to get involved with Seattle&rsquo;s literary community: literary magazines, open mic nights, literary news sources, book clubs, literary happy hours, places to volunteer, places to take classes. If you&rsquo;re new to town or you&rsquo;re just looking to get a little more serious about your commitment to literature, you&rsquo;ll find all sorts of ways to join the literary scene.
