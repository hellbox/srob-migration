        <div class="content">
          Nobody writes about the Northwest like Jon Raymond. From his gorgeous short stories— *Livability* is one of the finest books about the region to be published in the last two decades —to screenplays for films like *Old Joy* and *Wendy and Lucy* to novels like *Rain Dragon*, he’s perfected the art of writing about the lush vividness of Northwest nature, the peculiar mannerisms of Northwest people, and the sprawling wet-concrete grace of Northwestern cities.

          [A Yazidi refugee, stranded at the airport by Trump](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-yazidi-refugee-stranded-at-the-airport-by-trump) There are endless articles about this week&rsquo;s executive order limiting refugee entry into the United States, and you should read as many of them as you can stomach, and then keep reading. Trust credible sources, understand the legal and social issues, keep your eyes open despite your exhaustion and grief.
Donald Trump has taken or promised many scary, ugly actions in his first week in office, but this is the first with immediate and brutal human impact.

Ah, Kerry Park. As Seattle views go, it's hard to beat this one, and that's in a city with more vistas than West World. Have you ever been? It's crowded, nearly all the time (except, ironically, the day I dropped by to take these photos).

        <div class="content">
          We told you yesterday that the New York Times seems to be removing a number of categories from its popular bestseller list feature. Starting early in February, they won&rsquo;t be publishing bestseller lists for graphic novels, mass market paperbacks, and certain lists for middle readers and young adults.
 This story has developed since then.
 Alexander Lu at Comics Beat asked the New York Times why this change was happening, and the Times responded that &ldquo;the discontinued lists did not reach or resonate with many readers.

Dear Cienna,
Everybody is always complaining about post-apocalyptic fiction, but just look at where we are now? Kind of prescient, aren’t they?
Do you have any good recommendations for someone who&rsquo;s gone through the most popular YA versions of the genre?

          Whenever I visit a person&rsquo;s house, I immediately start checking out their bookshelves. Bookshelves are the best way to get a look into someone&rsquo;s interior life. Maybe that&rsquo;s why I find this tweet to be so upsetting:
