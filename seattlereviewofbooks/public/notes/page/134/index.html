        <div class="content">
          We just got an e-mail from John Marshall, the co-owner of Open Books in Wallingford. (If you&rsquo;ve never been, Open Books is one of a handful of poetry bookstores in the United States. And also, shame on you for living in Seattle and never going to Open Books.) Here it is, in its entirety:
Dear Friends of Open Books,
It is with mixed feelings that I tell you **I will retire from bookstore ownership sometime this year**.

        <div class="content">
          There once was an app called called Readmill. For a brief time, it was the best literature reading and social app. You stored and read books there, like a Kindle (although, only in the open ePub format). You could highlight sections in the book, and your friends could like, or comment on the quotes. You could sum up the book at the end. It was rather like a well-designed GoodReads mashed-up with a Kindle app that cared deeply about typography.

          GeekGirlCon announced that they&rsquo;re expanding their 2016 show to include the fourth floor of the Washington State Convention Center, which will give the sci-fi convention a lot more space for its programs and exhibitors. And the theme of this year&rsquo;s show is &ldquo;Every Geek, Everybody,&rdquo; striking an inclusive tone for the bigger-than-ever show. GeekGirlCon takes place on October 8th and 9th this year; you can buy tickets here.

        <div class="content">
          Anyone with even a passing interest in books should take a moment to acknowledge the death last month of Elizabeth Eisenstein, the first person to draw our attention to the momentous impact that printing had on human civilization. Nowadays, panel after panel of historians rank the invention of printing as mankind&rsquo;s most important invention since the wheel. But when Betty Eisenstein advanced that idea nearly thirty years ago, no one had thought of it before.

          On paper there is a woman and a heart. On
another, something is missing from a hand.
These are not metaphors. Weight becomes
a unit of measurement. Here. The point
of origin is here. Hands suspended
next to your skin is here. But that ends
here. Next to overturned boats and a drum
that can hold chemicals strong enough
to dissolve a body, but not dissolve itself.

          Hollow Earth Radio has announced the lineup for this year&rsquo;s Magma Fest, their monthlong music festival. Why is this the top news item on a book-related website? Because they&rsquo;re hosting at least two book-centric events in this year&rsquo;s Magma Fest. On March 13th, Sara Century is presenting a lecture on the history of LGBT characters in comics and Babel/Salvage is presenting the &ldquo;Glossophonic Showcase&rdquo; on March 25th, featuring readings from Kreg Hasegawa, Lauren Ireland, Sue Landers, and experimental musicians.

        <div class="content">
          Our sponsor Julie Manthey was camping at Cape Disappointment when she came up with the idea for her first novel, The Magic of Cape Disappointment. The history of Lewis &amp; Clark permeats the Columbia River outlet, and there are so many things unknown in the accounts of their history.
One fictional spark: what if Meriwether Lewis had children? What would happen if one his descendents, Kay, returned home to care for family, and discovered strange coincidences, unique characters, and, of course, a man that bears a resemblence to a mysterious character Kay had been painting?

        <div class="content">
          When Amazon bought the book-themed social media site Goodreads in 2013, Goodreads users went through three stages in quick succession. First, they were outraged, publishing angry posts to Facebook about how betrayed they felt. They hated that Goodreads sold out to the evil empire, wondered if their Goodreads data would be accessible to Amazon shoppers, and tried half-heartedly to find an alternative literary social media site.
Second, they mourned. They talked about how theyâ€™d never be able to trust Goodreads again, and wondered if everything they ever loved would eventually be absorbed into the Amazon mothership.

Her new book Pandemic examines the possibility of infectious disease destroying human civilization by examining the many times cholera has broken out over the last two centuries. Cholera has killed hundreds of millions of human beings. Which, you know, is depressing. But important!
TUESDAY Weâ€™re starting this day off by pointing out that Timothy Egan debuts his new book, Meagher, From Irish Immigrant to Hero, at Town Hall.
