We've got two open sponsorships in March we'd love to get into your hands. We've discounted them â€” $50 off for next week, March 6 - March 12, and $25 off for the week after, March 13 - March 19. [Grab 'em quick](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/)!

We're also in super-secret testing with some new sponsorship types. Besides events and books, we'd love to promote opportunities for writers (contests, call-for-entries, retreats, and anything else), and charitable giving. If you'd like to try either of those, we'd love to hear from you. [These discounted weeks](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/) might be a good low-risk way to try us out. [Send us an email](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/) if you have any questions or want to talk more.
