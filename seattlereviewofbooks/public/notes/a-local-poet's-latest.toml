Priscilla Long is a return sponsor. Her recently published book _Crossing Over_ has found a very strong reception from the local poetry scene. 

We have three poems from the <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">book on our sponsor page</a> for you to read. Our thanks to Priscilla for her sponsorship. Read through the work, and consider purchasing at a local store, like the one she recommends &mdash; Open Books.

Sponsors like Priscilla are what keep us running with the original content you see every day. We're so grateful she joined with us again to sponsor the site. Thanks to her for being part of our campaign to make <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Help us make internet advertisements 100 percent less terrible">internet advertising 100 percent less terrible.</a>
