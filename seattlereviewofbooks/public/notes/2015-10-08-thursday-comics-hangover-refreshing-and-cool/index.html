        <p>I couldn&rsquo;t make it to the comic book store last night because I was too busy celebrating at the launch party for <em>California Four O&rsquo;Clock</em>, the debut novel from <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> co-founder Martin McClellan. It was a big new comics Wednesday to miss; a ton of Marvel Comics relaunched yesterday with all-new first issues and status quos, including <em>Spider-Man</em>, <em>Iron Man</em>, and <em>Doctor Strange</em>. Of those three, the only one that I&rsquo;m at all interested in is <em>Doctor Strange</em>; writer Jason Aaron is often pretty good, and artist Chris Bachalo&rsquo;s noodly illustrations seem perfect for the baroqueness of the character as created by Steve Ditko. <em>Spider-Man</em> has been devalued in recent years by too many iterations of the same character — Marvel Comics will soon be publishing a ongoing comic book starring Spider-Men (and -Women) from across multiple dimensions, watering the brand down even further — and <em>Iron Man</em> is now written by Brian Michael Bendis, who has stretched himself way too thin in recent years.</p>

<p><p class="image-left"><img src="/webhook-uploads/1444288131828/url.jpg" alt="" /></p>And frankly, I&rsquo;m finding it hard to believe that any of these relaunches are going to be as exciting as the <em>Archie</em> relaunch. I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/09/thursday-comics-hangover-saga-split-in-two/">already written</a> about the first issue of Mark Waid and Fiona Staples&rsquo;s reimainging of Archie Andrews and his Riverdale gang. The third issue of the book is out, and it unbelievably keeps getting better as it goes along.</p>

<p>The third issue of <em>Archie</em> reintroduces the relationships between these characters in new and interesting ways, twisting the love triangle inside out. Archie is following new-to-town rich girl Veronica Lodge around like a hungry puppy, Jughead is trying to figure out what the hell is going on, and Betty is upset about the mysterious event that led to her breakup with Archie. It&rsquo;s packed with interesting characterization. Jughead is portrayed as ridiculously wise, with a keen sense of focus that grants him almost mystical properties. Veronica demonstrates great vulnerability at just the moment when we expect her to become a super-villain. Betty is so profoundly decent that the reader can&rsquo;t help but land on her side. Only Archie lacks a distinctive personality here; he may be the front man of this particular band, but he&rsquo;s doomed to only react to things happening around him. He&rsquo;s such a straight man you could use him as a ruler in a pinch.</p>

<p>The biggest potential problem with this version of <em>Archie</em> is that Fiona Staples has not signed on as an artist for the long haul. This is a visually dynamic comic that rewards re-reading. The characters&rsquo; body language is vivacious and evocative. The fashions are fun — clothing hangs on bodies realistically — and the big, moony eyes of our main characters seem full of aspiration and disappointment and, you know, life. In three short issues, <em>Archie</em> has transformed from a smart retooling of an ancient brand into the best high-school comic on the stands today. Marvel Comics should be taking notes: <em>this</em> is how you refresh an old idea.</p>
