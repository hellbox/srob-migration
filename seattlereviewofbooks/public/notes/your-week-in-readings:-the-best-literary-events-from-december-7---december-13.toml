<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday December 7th: Reading Through It: A Post-Election Book Club**</h5></p> 
Join the *Seattle Weekly* and the *Seattle Review of Books* as we try to make sense of Donald Trump’s America in a new monthly book club. Tonight, we’ll discuss J.D. Vance’s memoir *Hillbilly Elegy*. We’ll also be choosing the book for our February club based on your recommendations. *Third Place Books Seward Park, 5041 Wilson Ave S, 474-2200, http://thirdplacebooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday December 8th: *The Angel of History* Reading**</h5></p> 
Rabih Alameddine is one of the preeminent Arab-American voices in fiction today. His newest novel is about a gay Yemeni-Lebanese expatriate living in America during the AIDS epidemic and the post-9/11 security state. It’s a heartbreaking story of memory, identity, history, and culture, which makes it about as American as it gets. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *
