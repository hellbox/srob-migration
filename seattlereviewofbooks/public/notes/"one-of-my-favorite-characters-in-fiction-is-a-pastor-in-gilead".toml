If you haven't yet read [President Obama's interview with the incredible novelist Marilynne Robinson](http://www2.nybooks.com/articles/s3/2015/nov/05/president-obama-marilynne-robinson-conversation.html) in the *New York Review of Books*, please take the time to read it. I can't recall a sitting president ever doing something quite like this. It's just too delightful for words.
