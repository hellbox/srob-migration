Today is the 152nd birthday of Nellie Bly, whose real name was Elizabeth Cochran Seaman. Bly was a journalist in the early 20th century, best known for an undercover investigation into the horrid conditions of mental hospitals, and for an around-the-world trip, to realize the fictional travels of Jules Verne's _Around the World in Eighty Days_ (she did it in seventy-two). In 1922 she died, at fifty-seven, from pneumonia.
