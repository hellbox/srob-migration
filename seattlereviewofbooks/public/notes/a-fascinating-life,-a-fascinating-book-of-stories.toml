Sponsor Roy Lisker has done it all: he's a mathematician, political activist, underground journalist, prankster and provocateur, as well as playwright, poet, and writer of fiction. <a href="https://saggingmeniscus.com/catalog/lincoln-center-in-july/" title="Lincoln Center in July and Other Stories | Sagging Meniscus Press">Sagging Meniscus Press</a> has pulled together this first volume of Lisker's collected stories: "We regard the publication of these stories, all together for the first time, as an important event in American letters."

We have the start of his story "Amplitude of the Cosmos" <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">on our sponsor's page</a>, and it's wonderful work, complex, rhythmic, with a melodic rhyme and lilt, a formalist repetition that provides mood and music in the prose. It's worth your time to <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">click through</a> and familiarize yourself with Lisker's work, if you're not already a fan.
