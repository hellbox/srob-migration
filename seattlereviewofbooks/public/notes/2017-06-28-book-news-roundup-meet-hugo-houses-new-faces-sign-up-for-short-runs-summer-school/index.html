<li>Hugo House <a href="https://hugohouse.org/announcing-2017-2018-poetry-writer-residence-made-hugo-house-fellows/">announced their new Poet-In-Residence yesterday</a>. <strong>Amber Flame</strong> will be available for appointments starting on September 15th.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Flame has regularly worked as an activist and organizer for a diverse number of theatrical, cabaret, queer, and POC communities — both during her time in the Bay Area and since returning to Seattle. Her connections to a broad network of artists and teachers also extends to the growing immigrant community and incarcerated populations through her work with [The IF Project](http://www.theifproject.com/), a program funded by the Seattle Police Foundation.</blockquote>

<li><p>Yesterday, Hugo House <a href="https://hugohouse.org/announcing-2017-2018-poetry-writer-residence-made-hugo-house-fellows/">also announced their newest Made at Hugo fellows</a>, which is a program that creates a cohort of young Seattle writers and gives them access to all of the Hugo House&rsquo;s mighty educational opportunities. The Made at Hugo program is a great way to take the pulse of Seattle&rsquo;s next generation of literary talent. You&rsquo;ll be seeing more of these names in the near future: &ldquo;poet Holly DeBevoise, poet and writer Max Delsohn, writer Nia Dickens, poet Kym Littlefield, poet and artist Erin Lynch, and indigenous prose writer D.A. Navoti.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of mighty educational opportunities! <a href="http://shortrun.org/summer-school-full-schedule/#more-614">Short Run&rsquo;s summer school</a> looks like a lot of fun, with many free classes and all other classes below $50. Topics include letterpress printing, comics classes for kids, papermaking with local papercraft cartoonist Mita Mahato, and a class titled &ldquo;<strong>How to Be Self-Employed in Seattle</strong>&rdquo; that a lot of you should take.</p></li>

<li><p>Last year, some unpaid employees of Emerald City Comicon — who are unfortunately dubbed &ldquo;minions&rdquo; by ECCC leadership — sued the convention for compensation. Yesterday, lawyers announced that <a href="http://smashpages.net/2017/06/28/comics-lowdown-eccc-volunteer-suit-settled/">ECCC reached a settlement with the minions</a>.Brigid Alverson at Smash Pages writes:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Under the settlement, Eitane Emerald Corp. and the Demonakos family will pay almost $500,000 to the volunteers, with the lawyers scooping up $123,300 for their troubles, [former "minion" Jerry Michael] Brooks [who filed the suit in the first place] getting $5,000, and the 250 or so other “volunteers” will divvy up the rest according to how many hours they worked.</blockquote>

<li>This <a href="https://twitter.com/nick_kapur/status/879431974657695744">tweetstorm about BBC English</a> is a great illustration of how language evolves, and how what we think of as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; English probably didn&rsquo;t exist just a few short decades ago. A few highlights:</li>
