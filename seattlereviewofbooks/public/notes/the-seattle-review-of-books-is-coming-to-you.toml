Two housekeeping issues we'd like to share with our readers:

* If you're a Hugo House member, you can now sign up for ["The You Review of Books,"](https://hugohouse.org/store/class/the-you-review-of-books-paul-constant-and-martin-mcclellan/) a book reviewing class taught by myself and *Seattle Review of Books* co-founder Martin McClellan. We hope to teach you how to communicate with art, how to be a better reader, and how to appreciate book reviewing as an art form. If you're not a Hugo House member, you'll be able to sign up for the class starting next week. But you really ought to be a member of the Hugo House.

* Next week, Martin and I will be [reading at Phinney Books](http://www.phinneybooks.com/upcoming-events/) to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the Dock Street Salon, a very fun reading series that combines readings and informal chats in a laid-back setting. If you have any questions about this here website or our upcoming class, please drop on by. We hope to see you there.
