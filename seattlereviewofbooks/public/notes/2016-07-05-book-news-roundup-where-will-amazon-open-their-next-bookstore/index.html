      <div class="content">
        <ul>
<li><p>The fact that <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/postscript-elie-wiesel-1928-2016">Elie Wiesel passed away</a> on the same weekend that Donald Trump <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/david-duke-loved-trump-star-tweet">tweeted a barely coded anti-Semitic graphic</a> from a white supremacist group was more than just unfortunate timing: it served as a reminder that we need writers and advocates and witnesses like Wiesel in our public sphere more than ever. He will be missed.</p></li>

<li><p><em>The American Poetry Review</em> <a href="http://aprweb.org/news/2016/07/05/jane-wong-awarded-2016-stanley-kunitz-memorial-prize">just announced</a> that Seattle author Jane Wong won the Stanley Kunitz Memorial Prize for her poem &ldquo;I Put On My Fur Coat.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>If you missed <a href="http://crosscut.com/2016/07/a-writers-retreat-at-the-center-of-the-universe/">Lynn Schnaiberg&rsquo;s Crosscut profile of Elissa Washuta&rsquo;s new role as Writer-in-Residence at the Fremont Bridge</a>, you should read it now:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>What does pull her away from her books and laptop are the boats. Like the 205-foot Lady Lola “superyacht” she started following online. Oh, and the Fremont Avenue brawl for which she called 911. And the much-appreciated cellphone call she gets from the bridge operator every time the bridge is raised (a safety check to make sure she’s not on — or under — the bridge, since her tower affords access to its underbelly.)</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Seattle author Matt Ruff has had a good idea: if you have any questions about his <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/18/talking-with-matt-ruff-about-science-fictions-racist-past/">amazing new book <em>Lovecraft Country</em></a>, he&rsquo;s putting together <a href="http://www.bymattruff.com/2016/07/01/lovecraft-country-any-questions/">a Frequently Asked Questions</a> page on his site. Feel free to ask him anything, from book-club-friendly questions to specific plot points. It strikes us that very book should have a FAQ page.</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/07/03/amazon-set-to-rival-nycs-bookstores-with-hudson-yards-spot/"><em>New  York Post</em></a> — ugh, sorry for the link — reports that Amazon is planning to open its first east coast Amazon Books brick-and-mortar store in Manhattan.</p></li>

<li><p>A reminder: please <a href="http://gawker.com/notorious-fabulist-jonah-lehrer-wants-to-apologize-so-1783121303">don&rsquo;t read Jonah Lehrer&rsquo;s new book</a>. The fact that he&rsquo;s publicly failed so many times and yet is still being published by major presses is a serious indictment of the publishing industry.</p></li>

<li><p>I very much liked Ben Winters&rsquo; Last Policeman Trilogy, about a detective on an Earth that&rsquo;s facing down an apocalyptic asteroid strike. I haven&rsquo;t read his new book, <em>Underground Airlines</em>, but the below tweet from BuzzFeed&rsquo;s Saeed Jones accurately dismantles the publishing industry&rsquo;s breathless coverage of the book. Don&rsquo;t just operate under the assumption that an idea is new, or else you&rsquo;ll look like an uncultured ass, or a racist ass, or a racist uncultured ass:</p></li>
