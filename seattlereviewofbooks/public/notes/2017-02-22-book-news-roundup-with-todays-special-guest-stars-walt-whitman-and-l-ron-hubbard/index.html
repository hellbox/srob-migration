<li><p>The Seattle Public Library <a href="https://shelftalkblog.wordpress.com/2017/02/14/for-the-love-of-data-an-open-data-release/">has announced</a> that they&rsquo;ve made public a dataset which &ldquo;includes a count of checkouts by month of both physical and digital items, and spans from 2005 to the present.&rdquo; <a href="https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Checkouts-by-Title/tmmm-ytt6/data">You can find that list here</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="http://nebulas.sfwa.org/correction-sfwa-nebula-awards-ballot/">Nebula Awards ballot has been announced</a>. We couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased to announce that <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> contributor Nisi Shawl&rsquo;s novel <em>Everfair</em> is on the ballot for best novel. We&rsquo;re bummed to see that Seattle author Cat Rambo&rsquo;s short work &ldquo;Red in Tooth and Cog&rdquo; was bumped from the novelette category because it&rsquo;s a little too short to meet the word count.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.vulture.com/2017/02/long-lost-walt-whitman-novel-has-been-found-165-years-later.html">A novel by Walt Whitman has been discovered</a>. (To quibble: At 36,000 words, it&rsquo;s more of a novella than a novel.) It sounds positively Dickensian:</p></li>

<blockquote>...*Life and Adventures of Jack Engle*, is a first-person narrative following an orphan on his journey through New York, which included a full cast of colorful, diabolical money-and-power-hungry characters, as well as “virtuous Quakers” and a “sultry Spanish dancer.” Researchers believe that the work was never reprinted after it was published anonymously in the New York–area newspaper The Sunday Dispatch.</blockquote>
