* The delightfully named [Gabrielle Bluestone at Gawker](http://gawker.com/the-shameful-google-results-for-the-nine-republicans-wh-1762397833) reports that nine House Republicans voted against naming a post office after the late poet Maya Angelou. Then Bluestone turns the tables on them:

<blockquote><p>“I think people should investigate Maya Angelou a little bit, and I’ll suggest perhaps if you want to investigate a little bit further that perhaps you Google ‘Maya Angelou’ and look at other articles in places like the American Thinker or the American Spectator,” Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) said Tuesday.</p>
