        <p>Local writer Anca Szilagyi just published <a href="http://ancawrites.com/2015/08/20/affordable-housing-in-seattle/">a list of resources for people who need affordable housing options in Seattle</a>. Szilagyi says she thinks about affordable housing, in part, &ldquo;because I’m a writer with writer and artist friends.&rdquo; This is an issue we&rsquo;ve talked about before in the <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/exit-interview-talking-with-kate-lebo-about-why-she-left-seattle-for-spokane/">first installment of our Exit Interview series</a>, and we&rsquo;ll be addressing it more in the future.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an artist of any sort living in Seattle right now — or a bookseller, or a non-profit employee, or, really, anyone involved in the arts at all — rent is very likely at the top of your mind all the time. You don&rsquo;t have to suffer through this alone. Talk to your friends. Look up the resources available to you. Let&rsquo;s keep this conversation going.</p>
