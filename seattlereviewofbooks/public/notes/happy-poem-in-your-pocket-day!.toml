Today, at the ass-end of National Poetry Month, is [Poem In Your Pocket Day](https://www.poets.org/national-poetry-month/poem-your-pocket-day), which poets.org urges you to celebrate by "selecting a poem, carrying it with you, and sharing it with others throughout the day at schools, bookstores, libraries, parks, and workplaces."

Don't have a poem in your pocket? You can always print one out. [This poem is eminently pocket-sized](https://twitter.com/alice_notley/status/480654236108468225?lang=en). Also, [this one](http://www.loveblender.com/blend/wv.cgi?id=2003.08.01.20.48.8201). Open Books, which has been **all over this National Poetry Month thing this year**, is celebrating Poem in Your Pocket Day by giving away pocket poems all day to customers. They're also hosting a pocket-themed poetry reading with Seattle's Civic Poet, Claudia Castro Luna, at [El Centro De La Raza](http://www.elcentrodelaraza.org/) at 1:30 pm today.
