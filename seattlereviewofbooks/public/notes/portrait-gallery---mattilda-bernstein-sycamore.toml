Seattle writer, and [_Seattle Review of Books_ contributor](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/sitting-in-the-middle-of-a-clock/), Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore is [previewing her new reading series](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/06/01/event-of-the-week-contagious-exchanges-at-hugo-house/) tonight at Hugo House. You should definitely go.

And for your calendar next week, did you know that I'm having an art opening with paintings featured here in Portrait Gallery on Friday, June 10th? It's true! It's put on by Push/Pull Gallery, and the Seattle Review of Books, and is taking place at Essentia Mattresses Store on 1st Avenue. We'll be joined by [Lesley Hazelton](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/31/portrait-gallery-lesley-hazleton/), [Maged Zaher](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/24/portrait-gallery-maged-zaher/), and [Sarah Galvin](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/17/portrait-gallery-sarah-galvin/).
