NPR [published the news](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/14/515193632/author-philip-pullman-announces-a-follow-up-trilogy-to-his-dark-materials) this afternoon and literary Twitter demonstrated an excitement and an exuberance that I haven't seen since the days before the election:

<blockquote><p>The hugely successful fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials will be getting a "companion" trilogy, author Philip Pullman announced this evening.</p>

<p>The first book of the new series, which will collectively be called The Book of Dust, is set for publication on October 19.</p></blockquote>
