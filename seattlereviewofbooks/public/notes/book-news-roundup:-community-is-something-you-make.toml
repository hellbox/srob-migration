* Fantagraphics Books is publishing a new comics anthology, titled *Now*. And Fantagraphics associate publisher Eric Reynolds [explained to the *Comics Reporter*'s Tom Spurgeon](http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/cr_sunday_interview_bundled_extra_editor_eric_reynolds_of_fantagraphics_on/) that the idea for *Now* came straight out of Seattle:

<blockquote>The idea really coalesced after last year's Short Run festival. I went to that show with a plan to really canvas the show and see what was there. I don't get to actually shop extensively at shows very often, and I ended up dropping close to a couple of hundred bucks, buying anything that looked even remotely interesting. There was a lot of good work that I felt was probably being overlooked because of either the signal to noise ratio or even just the harsh realities of distribution. If you don't live in a region that has a show like Short Run, you're likely to never be exposed to a lot the work that's there. And I came away from that show realizing that Fantagraphics can provide a platform to get the work out there.</blockquote>

* Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor's talk at Town Hall last night was canceled, [Sara Bernard reported at the *Seattle Weekly*](http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/princeton-professor-cancels-town-hall-seattle-talk-following-deluge-of-racist-threats/). Taylor had received death threats since publicly criticizing Donald Trump at a commencement address. Funny, isn't it, how [one canceled Ann Coulter appearance](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/26/us/ann-coulter-berkeley-speech-canceled/) can inspire the mainstream media to talk endlessly about the snowflakes of the left, but Taylor's experience barely makes a dent in the popular consciousness? Anyway, maybe you should read Taylor's new book, *From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation*.

* [Megan Burbank at the *Mercury* reports](http://www.portlandmercury.com/blogtown/2017/05/31/19046795/portland-literary-community-rallies-around-micah-david-cole-fletcher) that Portland's literary community is coming together to support Micah David-Cole Fletcher, a poet who survived last Friday's white supremacist stabbing attack. Portland poets are hosting a number of benefit readings for Fletcher, including one with an appearance by Seattle-area poet Robert Lashley.

* HBO has [picked up the Julia Roberts-starring adaptation](http://www.vulture.com/2017/06/julia-roberts-series-today-will-be-different-hbo.html) of Seattle writer Maria Semple's novel *Today Will Be Different*.

* The [case against library late fees](http://bookriot.com/2017/05/30/library-late-fines-are-not-helping-anyone/).

* Only eight percent of all literary magazines [actually pay their contributors](http://www.themillions.com/2017/05/why-literary-journals-dont-pay.html).

* Speaking of depressing financial realities: want to make comics for a living? Better [marry someone who's got a steady, good-paying job](http://www.comicsbeat.com/graphic-novelist-quits-making-graphic-novels-after-trying-to-live-on-10kyear-for-three-years/)!
