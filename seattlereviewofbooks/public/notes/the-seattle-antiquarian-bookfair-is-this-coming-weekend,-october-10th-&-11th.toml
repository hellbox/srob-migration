The Seattle Antiquarian Bookfair is our sponsor again this week, and we're starting to get excited about the fair. It's this Saturday and Sunday, October 10th & 11th. Tickets are a huge bargain &mdash; only $5 for both days! &mdash; and you'll get to take in the best of what Seattle Center has to offer before or after you visit. [Check out the video on our sponsor page](/sponsorships) to get a feel for what you'll see there, and be sure to tell them you heard about it on the Seattle Review of Books (and, keep your eyes peeled for us there. We'll be checking it out).

Our partners are what let us bring you all the content you've see. If you check us to find out what we've published every day, take a look and see what our sponsors have to offer. You may be pleasantly surprised. It's all part of our campaign to make <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">online advertising something that benefits readers and publishers</a> both.
