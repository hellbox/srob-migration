We [told you back at the beginning of the month](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/08/01/mockingbird-books-to-close-at-the-end-of-august/) that Greenlake kids' store Mockingbird Books would be closing on August 27th. That means you have less than week to pay your respects and pick up some childrens' books on discount. [KOMO ran a video about](http://komonews.com/embed/news/local/customers-on-closure-of-popular-green-lake-bookstore-its-sad-to-lose-it) Mockingbird's last days.
