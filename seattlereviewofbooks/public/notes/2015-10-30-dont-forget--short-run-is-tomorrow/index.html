        <p>Tomorrow, the Short Run Comix &amp; Arts Festival will be happening <a href="http://www.shortrun.org/">at the Fisher Pavillion at Seattle Center from 11 am to 6 pm</a>. If you&rsquo;re looking for a ridiculously long list of all the exhibitors at the show, <a href="http://www.shortrun.org/exhibitors/">you can find that here</a>. But the best way to go to Short Run is to <strong>not have a plan</strong>. Bring some cash and walk around. If you see something you like, buy it. I know it&rsquo;s super-scary, but try talking to strangers.</p>

<p>If you do insist on making plans beforehand, you might be interested in the short interviews we&rsquo;ve been running with Short Run exhibitors all week long. Here they are in one handy list:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/07/meet-the-short-run-vendors-casandra-lopez-of-asus/">Casandra Lopez of <em>As/Us</em> magazine</a> will be presenting some new work, as well as back issues of her wonderful magazine.</li>
<li>Check out <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/14/meet-josh-simmons-at-short-run-bring-xanax/">Josh Simmons&rsquo;s horror comics</a>.</li>
<li>The art collective Fictilis will be <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/21/fictilis-wants-to-help-launch-conversations-at-short-run/">running a Short Run Census Bureau</a> that might be very helpful for first-time visitors to the festival.</li>
<li>Krish Raghav is the <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/28/meet-short-runs-first-dash-grant-winner-krish-raghav/">first Dash grant winner</a> in Short Run history. This is his first-ever show, and he&rsquo;s debuting a new comic travelogue of Mexico.</li>
</ul>

<p>But this is just a tiny portion of the dozens of exhibitors who will be at this festival. You owe it to yourself to show up and wander around and see what you can find. I&rsquo;ll be walking the floor tomorrow, trying to track down the next big local comics phenomenon. I hope to see you out there.</p>
