<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

<p><strong>Have you ever tried to get somebody to change by offering a book that you think might affect them? I have a friend who is drinking himself to death. He listens to books, but not people. Books have changed me, maybe one would change him. Any ideas?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Seth in Georgetown**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Seth,</p>

<p>As a teenager I received at least seven copies of *How to Make Friends and Influence People* from a bouquet of well-intentioned dickheads. I read the damn thing at least twice. It did not make me better at making friends, or even better at making eye contact with strangers. It did nothing but make me resent the fact that I was too old to be cute and too young to drink.</p>

<p>That said, I’d caution you about gifting a book with the hope of changing someone. In my view, books are not topical salves prescribed to fix personal flaws, they are the simplest form of love letter – you give them to people you love because you believe their content will resonate with them on an emotional and intellectual level. Whatever personal change occurs because of that connection is secondary.</p>

<p>Fortunately for you, I have a ton of heavy drinkers in my life and I love at least half of them. Here are three books I’ve read about addiction: [*Drinking, A Love Story*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385315548); [*The Night of the Gun*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781416541530); [*Dry*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250034403). I gave the first two as gifts to friends (I didn’t love *Dry*, to be honest, but I know quite a few people who did). The books did not change my friends’ drinking habits at all. But it did create an avenue to talk about addiction and we’ve had a few good conversations about alcoholism since then. Usually while drinking.</p>

<p>So: I recommend you read those books and see if any of them remind you of your friend. If you have the time and interest, you should also read [this fascinating article](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/04/the-irrationality-of-alcoholics-anonymous/386255/) published last year in *The Atlantic* that critically challenges the efficacy of AA.</p>

<p>More importantly, I’d like to point out that I have lots of friends now, even if most of them are only half sober. </p>

<p>Suck it, Dale Carnegie.</p>
