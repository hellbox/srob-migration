        <p>My friend on the couch trembles.<br>
She’s crying because someone in her family</p>

<p>has died/is dying/is dead. She has stopped<br>
speaking in future tense and only says, <em>Now</em>.</p>

<p>The clock speaks in abstract sentences<br>
and she says, <em>We need more wine</em>.</p>

<p>A corner of her life is being rebuilt<br>
by a construction company she hasn’t approved.</p>

<p>A corner and her driveway is being paved.<br>
With gravestones. When she cries, I pour her</p>

<p>a glass of minor relief, another glass<br>
of lessen, and still one more of forgetting, a refill</p>

<p>of liquid assistance. <em>There are too many days</em><br>
<em>to wait</em>, she says. And there are days</p>

<p>when the world’s veil is so thin, she feels God<br>
in the wind between the buildings.</p>

<p>She is almost mourning, but<br>
knows how close we all are</p>

<p>to being remembered. She is haunted<br>
by leaving, by the ones who already left,</p>

<p>all those doorways swinging open.<br>
<em>A breezeway to loss is where we are headed</em></p>

<p><em>no matter how hard we drag our feet</em>.<br>
She says she hates that she can’t stop wishing</p>

<p>for all of it to end, though sometimes in the blues<br>
of the curtain, she still sees <em>hope in hospice</em>.</p>
