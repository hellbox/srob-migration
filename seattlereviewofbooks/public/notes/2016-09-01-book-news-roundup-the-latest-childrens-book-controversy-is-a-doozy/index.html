<li>The children&rsquo;s book world is in turmoil right now over <a href="http://jewcy.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/childrens-book-german-suffering-wwii">a controversial new book for kids that focuses on German suffering during World War II</a>. Gabriela Geselowitz at Jewcy first notes the similarity to <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-idea-of-freedom-might-be-too-great-a-temptation-for-them-to-resist/">the kid&rsquo;s book from earlier this year which made light of slavery</a>, and then she writes:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Part of what is disturbing about the reception of the book is the unexplored idea of the motherâ€™s brief attempt to seat the slave laborers at the kitchen table as a great act of bravery and resistance, a sufficient antidote to the evil which is not even alluded to in the rest of the story.</blockquote>

<li><p>Seth Grahame Smith, the author of <em>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em>, is <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/seth-grahame-smith-publisher-sued-pride-prejudice/">being sued by his publisher for breach of contract</a> because he reportedly turned in a remixed public-domain work and they expected an all-new work.</p></li>

<li><p>This <a href="http://www.theouthousers.com/index.php/features/136167-die-industry-die-or-why-letting-comics-fail-is-the-real-only-way-to-save-the-industry.html">bomb-throwing story</a> at comics news and commentary site The Outhousers is certainly a little aggro, but it makes a good point: it&rsquo;s very weird that the comic book industry entirely relies on pre-orders. No other industry builds their entire business model on the idea that customers pre-order their products, sight unseen. Books can live and die before readers even get to check out the first issue. There must be a better way to run the industry, right?</p></li>
