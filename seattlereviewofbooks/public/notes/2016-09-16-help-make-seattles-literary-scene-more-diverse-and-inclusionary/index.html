        <p>In case you couldn&rsquo;t tell from our <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/09/07/public-diversity-editor-report-1-september-2016/">diversity reports</a> or our thoughts on <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/09/14/on-lionel-shriver-and-cultural-appropriation-in-fiction/">the current discussion on cultural appropriation in fiction</a>, we take issues of diversity seriously here at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>. We don&rsquo;t always get it right, but we try. And we think it&rsquo;s always important for Seattle&rsquo;s literary community to keep issues of diversity in mind.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I want you to know about the second in a series of free workshops on racial equity in the literary arts that&rsquo;s sponsored by Seattle: City of Literature. This workshop will be on &ldquo;Implicit Bias,&rdquo; it takes place on September 27th, and you can <a href="http://us8.campaign-archive1.com/?u=c553a0a55c8aedd0b0cc40040&amp;id=b2b228bb0a&amp;e=94516a4ac8">RSVP for it right here</a>.</p>

<p>In the workshop, Dr. Caprice Hollins will &ldquo;will encourage participants to challenge the impact of racial sterotypes and implicit bias&rdquo; in an effort to learn &ldquo;how these unspoken and often unconscious stereotypes create barriers to genuine relationships and influence our attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs about one another.&rdquo; Hollins has over two decades of experience talking about these matters with organizations like Seattle Public Schools.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/05/27/now-is-the-time-to-rsvp-for-a-free-workshop-on-racial-equity-and-the-literary-arts/">interviewed City of Literature&rsquo;s interim executive director</a>, Stesha Brandon, about the series of workshops a few months back. You don&rsquo;t need to have attended the last workshop in order to attend this one.</p>

<p>Every few months in Seattle&rsquo;s literary scene, someone will make a dumb statement about race, or host a panel of white dudes, or thoughtlessly encroach on someone else&rsquo;s culture. And every time this happens, the person in the spotlight will claim cluelessness. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize,&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll say. &ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve known better.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s through conversations like this that we <em>do</em> realize, that we <em>do</em> learn how to do better. If you&rsquo;re part of an organization that deals with the literary arts in Seattle, I urge you to send someone to this workshop to listen and to report back what they&rsquo;ve learned. This is how you avoid thoughtless mistakes; I&rsquo;m so grateful to City of Literature for leading the way with these talks.</p>
