        <p>This is the most perfect thing for an election year. Sponsor Entre Rios books, who makes those lovely poetry volumes that are so beautiful in the hand, is back to show off their upcoming collection of Percy Bysse Shelley&rsquo;s political poems.</p>

<p>What? Didn&rsquo;t you know that Shelley wrote political poems? They were not collected until after his death, and were often passed around hand-to-hand in activist circles. We&rsquo;ve got a sample page and sample poem <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">on our sponsors page</a>. The book will be available April 5th, so reserve a copy today.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/">take a look at our open dates</a>. We&rsquo;d love to talk to you about opportunities to sponsor us. It&rsquo;s our way of making internet advertising something to look forward to.</p>
