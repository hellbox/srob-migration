On November 5th and 6th, Third Place Books is having their [semi-annual used book sale](https://www.facebook.com/events/1066315310151796/). Every used book at all three Third Place locations will be 40 percent off. And they're trying something new this time around: if you visit and spend at least $5 at each location, you'll get a $10 gift card. It's going to be a long winter, and this is a great way to stock up your nightstand.
