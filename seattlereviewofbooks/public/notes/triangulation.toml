She squishes through fish, salmon stacked up to the door,<br>
boots tracking scales in the wheelhouse, on the galley floor,<br>
down the companionway, and in the engine room.<br>
By the end of the day, there are scales on the mast. Scales<br>
on the deck winch, on the ladder and steps. Scales in her hair,<br>
in her gloves, up her sleeves, behind her ears. Scales<br>
like freckles. Scales like glitter. Like bindis, like dragon skin.<br>
Scales in her eyes like contact lenses. Scales flaking<br>
and scales sticking like glue. Scales flashing like diamond bling,<br>
like glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling, like fairy dust,<br>
like silver dimes, like new shoes on the first day of school,<br>
like piñata candy spilled into rust-colored mud. Scales<br>
that taste like caviar, like salt, like sperm, the musty crush<br>
of ocean and the stink of lust. These confetti-cake scales,<br>
these sprinkles and bejewelers, these flat raindrops, these<br>
dollar signs, these smashing dashing scales like a pint-size<br>
helping of spice, you lucky bastard, you don’t even know,<br>
but for each of these she scrubs and scrapes and cleans away,<br>
she dreams your fingers drumming softly on her skin. In the shower,<br>
she dreams your fingers into streams on her back, into stars<br>
that see, into mist, into smoke, into fire that breathes.<br>
Your fingers are whole notes on the bass clef or willows<br>
sweeping windows in a warm breeze or cigarettes or<br>
a fast bet you win in a hailstorm of desire. Fingers<br>
that smell like diesel, like danger, like a damp, darling copy<br>
of her body. Fingers that chart her scars like ocean trenches,<br>
that flit like a seabird skims sky. Fingers that tap like a typist<br> 
but spell crave like a racecar takes curves. Fingers like buttons<br>
on a birthday suit, like the wrong wrench, like the right wrench<br>
and the screwdriver that turns everything loose. Fingers<br>
like marching, like ants, like the crumbs they hunt,<br>
and the sugar they love, like butter, like cream, like I scream<br>
into a cornfield from a car full of flesh. She dreams<br>
his fingers on fleece, on flannel, on denim, on copper,<br>
on cotton, on nipples, on knees. How can I compare? I love her<br>
the way a King’s black mouth gapes for air, the way<br>
any salmon will taste the whole ocean and still turn for home.
