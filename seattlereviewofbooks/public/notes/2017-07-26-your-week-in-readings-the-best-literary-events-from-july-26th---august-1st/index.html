<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Saturday, July 29th: <em>Fetch</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Sunday July 30th: Freeway Park Walking Tour</strong></h5></p>
Freeway Park is Seattle’s creepiest park, but it’s also kind of impressive. It was the first lid to go over a freeway in the United States. Your guides will walk you through the history of the park in a tour that will span more than five acres. Brutalism never looked so inviting.

Science on Tap is a monthly conversation about scientific topics. It’s been happening at the Ravenna Third Place for years, though it recently moved from the pub upstairs to the Vios Café. Tonight’s session has a very non-controversial title: &ldquo;Mapping the impact of racism in Seattle: Have we moved past it?&rdquo;
