Good news! [The *Seattle Weekly* now has a weekly comics column](http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/960981-129/do-you-think-a-tech-bro) in whch a local cartoonist illustrates an interview with a local band. In the first installment, the fabulous Robyn Jordan illustrates Janice Headley's interview with the band Childbirth. If you don't know Childbirth, they're a poppy punk band that wears hospital gowns onstage and sing catchy, awesome feminist songs like "I Only Fucked You As a Joke."

This is great stuff, and it manages to highlight our amazing comics scene and our amazing music scene, simultaneously. What's not to love?
