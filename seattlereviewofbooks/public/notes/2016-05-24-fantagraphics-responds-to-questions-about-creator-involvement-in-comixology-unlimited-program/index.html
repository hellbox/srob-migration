        <p>I sent an email to Eric Reynolds, the associate publisher at Seattle&rsquo;s Fantagraphics Books, to ask about how his company dealt with the so-called &ldquo;Netflix of Comics,&rdquo; <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/05/24/maybe-dont-sign-on-to-the-netflix-of-comics-just-yet-okay/">Amazon&rsquo;s Comixology Unlimited</a> program. Did they alert their creators about the program before it was announced? Do those creators have the right to withdraw from the Unlimited program if they&rsquo;re unhappy with it? Here is Reynolds&rsquo; response in full:</p>

<blockquote><p>I did not consult with individual creators, but as with all of our digital sales relationships (subscription or otherwise), I've made a point to enter into non-exclusive and non-binding contracts that allow us to remove any titles at a moment's notice from any platform, in the event that we as a company or an individual author decides they want no part of it  (thus far, it's never happened).</p>

<p>I had been approached by a few companies over the past couple of years who have been trying to get a subscription model off the ground, and to be honest, I've resisted for a variety of reasons.</p> 

<p>That said, I decided to dip our toes into Comixology's program because I think it is frankly the best positioned to gain traction in the marketplace. We'll see. We are offering a limited selection of backlist -- no frontlist. No frontlist was my primary "demand" in negotiating with Comixology, and they were completely accommodating.</p> 

<p>So, yeah, we'll see how it plays out!</p></blockquote>

<p>(A quick note for those of you who are unfamiliar with book industry terminology: &ldquo;frontlist&rdquo; basically means &ldquo;new releases,&rdquo; the kind of books you&rsquo;ll find at the front of bookstores on display tables and bestseller displays.) Soon after emailing, Reynolds sent a followup message just to clarify a point:</p>

<blockquote>I should also add: I only included titles that we already had rights to sell digitally. Obviously, if we didn't have those rights, then a conversation would need be had. That should go without saying, but just in case.</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ll let you know if Image Comics releases a statement on how they involved their creators in Comixology Unlimited.</p>
