Terry McMillan, who our own Paul Constant [called "a goddamned legend"](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/06/15/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-june-15th-june-21st/), is reading Monday at the main branch of the Seattle Public Library, in support of her new novel _I Almost Forgot About You_.
