        <p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday May 24th: Displaced: Refugee Voices in Conversation**</h5></p> 
The Northwest Immigrant and Refugee Health Coalition is assembling a panel of refugees to discuss what it’s like to become a refugee in this country, and what life in America for refugees is like right now. These are conversations that everyone should hear — a reminder that Trump’s policies have real repercussions for real people.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Friday May 26th: Lashley/Lilley</strong></h5></p>
You already know that Robert Lashley is a force of nature. He’s one of the most vibrant readers to come out of the Pacific Northwest. You might not know poet Gary Copeland Lilley, a Cave Canem fellow whose latest book is <em>The Bushman’s Medicine Show</em>. Together, the two of them are a bicoastal poetry assassin squad.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Saturday May 27th: <em>Ghosts of Seattle Past</em> at Folklife</strong></h5></p>
Hard to believe that Folklife is happening already — possibly because it’s been a rainy dismal hellscape for the last six months. But we finally made it! And why not celebrate the death of dismal winter with a special group reading by contributors to <em>Ghosts of Seattle Past</em>, the book which celebrates lost local landmarks?
<em>Seattle Center, <a href="http://www.nwfolklife.org/festival-schedule/">http://www.nwfolklife.org/festival-schedule/</a>. Free. All ages. 1:15 p.m</em></p>

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Sunday May 28th: <em>Girl on the Road</em> Reading</strong></h5></p>
Seattle’s Office of Arts &amp; Culture gives out grants to artists of all kinds. One of those grants went to local cartoonist Noel Franklin, for the completion of her memoir, <em>Girl on the Road</em>. This afternoon, Franklin presents a reading from the book, which is about friendship and loss and grief. She’ll also have printed samples of the book available for the audience.

<p><p class="noindent"><h5><strong>Monday May 29th: Lost in Translation</strong></h5></p>
Look, you’ve always wanted to read onstage, but maybe you’ve been afraid of embarrassing yourself at your favorite reading? This is your chance to participate in a once-yearly reading. Sign up 30 minutes before the reading, and participants will be selected at random. If selected, you’ll have five minutes onstage, and if you screw — you won’t — you’ll never see these people again. Go live your dream.
