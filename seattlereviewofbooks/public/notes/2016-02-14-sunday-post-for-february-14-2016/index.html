        <h5>[Samuel R. Delany Speaks](http://www.thenation.com/article/samuel-r-delany-speaks/)</h5>

<p>Wonderful interview with the one and only Samuel R. Delany, by Cecilia D&rsquo;Anastasio.</p>

<blockquote>
    When he was 11, Samuel R. Delany stayed overnight at a Harlem hospital for observation. It was 1953, and nearly a decade before Delany would publish his first science-fiction novel. He had already realized he was gay. With trepidation, he asked the doctor, a white man, how many gays existed in America. The doctor laughed. “[He] told me it was an extremely rare disease,” Delany says. “No more than one out of 5,000 men carried it.” Rest assured, the doctor added, no medical records existed confirming the existence of black homosexuals. “Simply because I was black,” Delany says, “I didn’t need to worry!”

<h5>[How Valley of the Dolls went from a reject to a 30-million best-seller](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/how-valley-of-the-dolls-went-from-a-reject-to-a-30-million-best/?src=longreads)</h5>

<p>Self promotion was Jacqui Susann&rsquo;s game, and she was so good at it, that she started a viral movement without that crutch, the internet, that we all rely on now. Martin Chilton writes it for the Telegraph.</p>

<blockquote>
    Her novel _Valley of the Dolls_ was dismissed as "painfully dull, inept, clumsy, undisciplined, rambling and thoroughly amateurish". So how did such a poor book go on to be registered in The Guinness Book of World Records in the late Sixties as the world's most popular novel? The success of _Valley of the Dolls_ – to date more than 30 million copies have been sold worldwide – is a tale of one of the most tenacious and sharp-eyed publishing campaigns of all time.

<h5>[Liquid Assets](https://www.propublica.org/article/can-wall-street-solve-the-water-crisis-in-the-west)</h5>

<p>In drought, with water as a diminishing resource, controlling a very limited resource becomes a playground for people who like to make a lot of money. Abraham Lustgarten, in a very long and detailed piece for ProPublica, looks at Wall Street&rsquo;s interest in Western water rights.</p>

<blockquote>
    Deane is not a rancher or a farmer; he’s a hedge-fund manager who had flown in from New York City the previous night. And as he appraised the property, he was less interested in its crop or cattle potential than in a different source of wealth: the water running through its streams and coursing beneath its surface. This tract would come with the rights to large amounts of water from the region’s only major river, the Humboldt. Some of those rights were issued more than 150 years ago, which means they outrank almost all others in the state. Even if drought continues to force ranches and farms elsewhere in Nevada to cut back, the Diamond S will almost certainly get its fill.
