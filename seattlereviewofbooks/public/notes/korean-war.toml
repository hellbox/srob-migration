You are the North and I am the South.<br> 
My tanks aim for you. I shoot you a thousand times.

Your missiles launch into my oceans. You raise monuments to scorn me.<br> 
You eat clams cooked in gasoline. 

I drink milk and cider. I raise skyscrapers of businessmen.<br>
You build towers of empty rooms. You refuse me from where I am most loved. 

I clean a wintermelon of its guts and seeds cling to my wet fingers.<br> 
Aren’t you the North, and I the South? 

Phantom, disease, you’re trembling. There is no patience in my country.<br> 
There is no safest place in yours. 

The heart stiffens at the sound of church bells. I wonder where you sleep now.<br>
You are the North and I am the South. 

I cannot see the sky beyond the ceiling.<br> 
I cannot forgive you for cutting me out.

 I see all my ground, and you, walking over me—before you were<br> 
the North and I was the South. 

A photographer captures a mass execution on film.<br> 
Men and women tied to posts, blindfolded—Korean spies. 

The man nearest to the camera fiddles with his blindfold<br> 
until it rests comfortably over his eyes.
