This [post at Lady Business](http://ladybusiness.dreamwidth.org/2015/09/29/gender-discrimination-in-sff-awards.html) begins:

<blockquote>This project demonstrates that SFF books by or about cis women are less likely to win awards than books by or about cis men. Trans and nonbinary authors do not win awards at all, and trans or nonbinary protagonists are extremely rare. Overall, there were more award-winning books written by cis men about cis men than there were books by women about anybody...</blockquote>

While of course the news they deliver is bad, it's heartening to see other people [taking up Nicola Griffith's charge](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/27/talking-with-nicola-griffith-about-the-importance-of-counting-womens-stories/) to count the number of womens' voices in literature. Go [read the whole thing](http://ladybusiness.dreamwidth.org/2015/09/29/gender-discrimination-in-sff-awards.html) and then spread it far and wide.
