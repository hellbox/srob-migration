<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on in the Seattle book world right now:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do you know a promising young writer? There&rsquo;s still time for them to apply to the <a href="http://www.jackstraw.org/programs/ed/youngwriters.shtml">brand-new Jack Straw Young Writers program</a>. Press materials say that &ldquo;Selected writers will take part in one-on-one mentoring sessions with professional writers, a live performance coaching session, and a studio recording session with vocal coaching.&rdquo; Any high school student in Seattle is eligible; applications are due by Friday, January 22nd.</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of Jack Straw, have we raved about the writers that curator Karen Finneyfrock chose for the <a href="http://www.jackstraw.org/programs/writers/WritersForum/#wp16">2016 Jack Straw Writers Program</a> yet? Soak this in: Anis Gisele, Ramon Isao, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/06/korean-war/">EJ Koh</a>, Robert Lashley, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/07/meet-the-short-run-vendors-casandra-lopez-of-asus/">Casandra Lopez</a>, Kirsten Sundberg Lunstrum, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/authors/corinne-manning/">Corinne Manning</a>, Ruby Hansen Murray, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/20/an-interview-with-shin-yu-pai-redmonds-new-poet-laureate/">Shin Yu Pai</a>, Alison Stagner, Shontina Vernon, and Carolyne Wright. These are going to be some kick-ass readings: the thought of Koh, Pai, and Lashley sharing a stage makes our knees go weak.</p></li>

<li><p>This is your midpoint reminder that the <a href="http://www.floatingbridgepress.org/chapbook/subguidelines/">Floating Bridge Press Chapbook Competition</a> is still accepting entries through March 1st. The writer of the winning poetry chapbook will receive $500, their chapbook will be published, and they&rsquo;ll be the featured reader at a Floating Bridge event.</p></li>

<li><p>The new issue of <em>Cirque: A Literary Journal for Alaska and the Pacific Northwest</em> is <a href="http://www.cirquejournal.com/index.php">available online</a> and in print. It features a short story by Seattle author David Fewster, &ldquo;The Poetry Slam,&rdquo; which is set in Seattle.</p></li>

<li><p>This morning, <a href="https://hugohouse.org/event/ask-the-oracle-at-hotel-sorrento/">the Hugo House announced a fascinating new series</a> that will be happening at the Sorrento: &ldquo;Ask the Oracle&rdquo; will feature writers using their own books as fortune-telling devices. Audience members will ask questions, and the writers will provide answers from the text of their books. They&rsquo;ve got a great lineup for spring, including writers like <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/21/lit-crawl-itinerary-8-local-favorites/">Stacey Levine</a>, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/27/an-interview-with-david-schmader-the-brand-new-creative-director-at-the-bureau-of-fearless-ideas/">David Schmader</a>, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/tolstoys-unhappy-family-moves-to-the-northwest/">Megan Kruse</a>, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/what-the-heart-wants/">Sarah Galvin</a>, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/25/rattail/">Anastacia Tolbert</a>, and <a href="https://hugohouse.org/classy-talk-with-kary-wayson/">Kary Wayson</a>. Sounds like a fun spin on the traditional reading. The first one is on February 8th.</p></li>
