Through Sunday, our sponsor Chatwin Books is allowing us run the introduction and a full chapter from J.G. Perkins' _The Announcers_. 

<blockquote>
For those who shared it, the American Dream was wonderful. I awakened from part of that dream early and watched, in one way or another, much of the rest of the country follow over several decades. Some are still asleep. Like many of the awakened, I found that my dream had elements of a nightmare. And while I treasure truth above all else, I envy those who are still dreaming.
