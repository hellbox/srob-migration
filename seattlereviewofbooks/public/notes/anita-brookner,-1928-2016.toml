The Booker-winning author of novels including *Hotel du Lac*, *Altered States*, and *The Rules of Engagement* [died at the age of 87](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35808651?ns_mchannel=social&ns_campaign=bbc_breaking&ns_source=twitter&ns_linkname=news_central). Brookner had the kind of career to which most novelists should aspire: long, productive, and meaningful. You could choose any one of her books at random and be assured that you're about to read a stylistically powerful, satisfying novel. That's the best kind of legacy.
