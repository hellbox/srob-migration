[We're featuring a full chapter from Kelley Eskridge's novel _Solitaire_ this week](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships). You have thorugh tomorrow to read the whole first chapter. 

_Solitaire_ is a New York Times Notable Book, a Borders Original Voices selection, and a Nebula, Endeavour, and Spectrum Award finalist. Also, very exciting: a feature based on _Solitaire_ production later this month in Australia. 

Our sponsorships are not like you see on other websites. We're fighting back against horrible internet advertising by offering you something new to read, full chapters, without any weirdness, tracking across websites, or deliberate confusion. It's our way of <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">fighting horrible internet advertising.</a> You can help us by [visiting our Sponsors page and reading the chapter](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships). See if it's to your liking, and if so, think about buying the book.
