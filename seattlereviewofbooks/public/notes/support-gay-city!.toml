<p class="noindent">Well, you rendered [Northwest Associated Arts'](http://nwassociatedarts.org/) sponsorship useless by buying all the tickets to their Neil Gaiman event, so they kindly donated this week's sponsorship to a good cause: [Gay City](https://www.gaycity.org).</p>

Did you know that Gay City has a [7,000 volume library](https://www.gaycity.org/library/) centered around LGBT interest and focus? Please consider [donating to Gay City](https://www.gaycity.org/donate/) to support their important mandate for supporting LGBT culture and health in our city. 

Sponsors like Northwest Associated Arts make the _Seattle Review of Books_ possible. Did you know you could sponsor us, as well? Get your stories, or novel, or event in front of our passionate audience. Take a glance at [our sponsorship information page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/) for dates and details.
