        <p>Our sponsor this week, Donald Kentop, became fascinated with the Triangle Factory Fire, after learning that the building where the tragedy happened still stands as the Asch Building. It&rsquo;s part of New York University, and Kentop had classes in the building when he was a student.</p>

<p>He has woven a deep history of the fire, told in verse, through the stories of survivors, victims, and the unfolding of the event itself, in his book <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships"><em>Frozen by Fire</em></a>. The book, full of images and portraits, is a rich portrait of a tragedy the shaped American life.</p>

<p>Kentop <a href="http://www.spl.org/audiences/adults/adu-calendar-of-events?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D116453669">will be appearing Sunday, November 15th</a> to read from the work, at the Seattle Public Library&rsquo;s Ballard Branch.</p>
