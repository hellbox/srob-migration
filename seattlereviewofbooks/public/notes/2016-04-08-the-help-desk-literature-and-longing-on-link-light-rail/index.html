        <p class="intro">*Every Friday, Cienna Madrid offers solutions to lifeâ€™s most vexing literary problems. Do you need a book recommendation to send your worst cousin on her birthday? Is it okay to read erotica on public transit? Cienna can help. Send your questions to* advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

<p><strong>I ride the new Link light rail from Husky Stadium to Pioneer Square (it&rsquo;s pretty great). I&rsquo;ve seen this same girl on the train nearly every day, our schedules are so close. And she&rsquo;s always reading the best books. Seriously, like this manga series I&rsquo;ve been following for years, that I thought nobody else was into.</strong></p>

<p><strong>But, I know that harassing women who want to be left alone in public isn&rsquo;t cool, and she&rsquo;s probably just going to work. Is there something I can say to her, not a <em>line</em>, but just a little opening, to see if I get any response? I mean, is it out of line to say something about our shared tastes?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">**Tremulous on the Train**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Tremulous,</p>

<p>Everyone who reads enjoys being complimented on their taste in books. Many years ago I was flipping through a copy of one of my favorite books, <em>A Confederacy of Dunces</em>, at a garage sale and a shirtless man with a chest tattoo of a swastika knifing a black panther (one of the swastika arms was an actual arm with a knife in it) said to me, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great book,&rdquo; to which I smiled and thought, &ldquo;what a nice man.&rdquo; Such is the mighty power of literature.</p>

<p>Striking up a conversation with a woman is not harassment if you follow basic social cues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wear something non-psychotic, like a shirt and pants.</p></li>

<li><p>If she&rsquo;s got headphones in, leave her alone.</p></li>

<li><p>If she&rsquo;s not making eye contact with anyone around her, leave her alone.</p></li>

<li><p>Wait until there is a natural interruption to her reading, such as when you&rsquo;re both disembarking from the train. Then it&rsquo;s fine to tap her on the shoulder and say something like, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s such a great book! Have you read TKTKTK?&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>If all goes well and you get her contact information, do not send her an Evite for a party in your pants.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
