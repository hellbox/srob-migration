**Friday May 12th: *Love and Trouble* Reading**</p>

<p class="noindent">
Bainbridge memoirist Claire Dederer debuts her much-anticipated new book. Subtitled A Midlife Reckoning, *Love and Trouble* is about what happens when Dederer finds herself in an unexpected state of sexual reawakening. The book juxtaposes Dederer’s youth and her midlife into a single narrative, tied together through eroticism. <br />
*Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m.*
