The branch in question, of course, is the The Douglass-Truth Library.</p></li>

<blockquote>It has been life-affirming to see so many writers bless us with some of their first professionally published piecesâ€Šâ€”â€Šwomen writers of color, trans writers, queer writers, disabled writersâ€Šâ€”â€Štalking about some of the most important issues of the day with actual lived experience. I have loved knowing that every piece is edited with integrity, and that every writer is paid for their labor. To be a member of the founding team of a rare platform that is fair and equitable and treats all writers with respect has given my work more purpose and satisfaction than I could have ever imagined.</blockquote>

<li><p>Seattle writer Anca Szilagyi <a href="https://ancawrites.com/2017/03/06/lanternfish-press-to-publish-my-debut-novel-dirty/">announced yesterday</a> that her debut novel, <em>Dirty</em>, will be published by Lanternfish Press &ldquo;in late 2017 or early 2018.&rdquo; She describes the book as &ldquo;a magical realist work about a teenage runaway whose father is disappeared during Argentinaâ€™s Dirty War.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Tomorrow, to celebrate International Women&rsquo;s Day, Tor.com will publish new flash fiction by a host of great sci-fi authors â€”Â including Charlie Jane Anders, Maria Dahvana Headley, Nisi Shawl, Carrie Vaughn, and many more â€”Â on the theme &ldquo;<a href="http://www.tor.com/2017/03/06/nevertheless-she-persisted-announcement/">Nevertheless, She Persisted</a>.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Jillian Kay Melchior <a href="https://heatst.com/culture-wars/ohio-bookstore-flips-male-authored-books-displaying-them-backwards/">at Heatstreet</a> writes: &ldquo;To draw attention to female authors, a Cleveland bookstore celebrated Womenâ€™s History Month by turning every male-written book in the fiction room backward on its shelf.&rdquo; <a href="https://heatst.com/culture-wars/ohio-bookstore-flips-male-authored-books-displaying-them-backwards/">Go look at the picture</a> of what the bookstore looked like, now imagine what your shelves would look like if you did the same. Better yet, actually try it on your own bookshelves. It only took Loganberry Books 2 hours to do this with their 10,000 titles.</p></li>

<li><p>Headline of the day: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.poynter.org/2017/the-new-yorkers-new-bot-will-tweet-92-years-worth-of-poetry-at-you/451314/">The New Yorkerâ€™s new bot will tweet 92 years worth of poetry at you</a>.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Print magazine sales <a href="http://www.foliomag.com/newsstand-sales-drop-another-12-4-percent-2016/">declined 12.4 percent last year</a>. It&rsquo;s not as steep a drop as the year before, but it&rsquo;s still bad news for print media.</p></li>

<li><p>Always warms our hearts to see book reviewers start out young:</p></li>
