        <p>Mara Siegler <a href="http://pagesix.com/2017/07/07/milo-yiannopoulos-files-10m-lawsuit-against-simon-schuster/">at Page Six</a> writes that professional troll and amateur hate-monger Milo Yiannopoulos is suing Simon &amp; Schuster for ten million dollars. The publisher <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/02/21/simon-schuster-finally-cancels-dangerous-by-milo-yiannopoulos/">canceled Yiannopoulos&rsquo;s book</a> after some of his pro-pedophilia comments came to light. Siegler writes:</p>

<blockquote>In the suit filed with the New York County clerk, Yiannopoulos claims the publisher caused “irreparable harm” to him and “the commercial value of his public persona, including millions of dollars in royalties and fees, as well as permanent harm to the development and exploitation of his stature as an important, sought after media figure and free speech personality.”</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be tough for Yiannopoulos to prove that his public persona, which is human garbage, can actually be damaged. But this case could end in a juicy settlement for him.</p>

<p>In any case, <strong>I have no sympathy for Simon &amp; Schuster</strong>. This is exactly what happens when you play with venomous snakes. They pretended to care about free speech, until the free speech became hugely unpopular. Hopefully, they&rsquo;ll learn from this whole disgraceful affair.</p>
