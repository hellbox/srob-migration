        <div class="content">
          Beloved Seattle-area poet Crysta Casey passed away in 2008, but her work is very much alive. Casey wrote poems about what it meant to be her: she wrote openly and with great energy about her schizophrenia, and her cancer journey. Her work was vital and personal and incredibly strong — there’s probably no greater indicator of the power of Casey’s writing than the fact that her dearest friends are still safeguarding and expanding her legacy.

        <div class="content">
          Every so often in Seattle, a writer pops into the popular consciousness. You’ll find them everywhere at once: in every Seattle-centric magazine, newspaper, and website that covers the literary scene. (Yes, and there aren’t so many of those these days, but that’s a complaint for another time.)
When these kinds of writers appear — a Robert Lashley, say, or a Sarah Galvin, to use two recent-ish examples — it must be easy for aspiring authors to fall prey to jealousy.

          Every month, Nisi Shawl presents us with news and updates from her perch overlooking the world of science-fiction, fantasy, and horror. You can also look through the [archives of the column](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-future-alternative-past).
Subbasements Some folks consign SFFH to the nether regions of literature. Never mind that the world’s earliest tales, whether duly recorded and or merely oft-repeated &mdash; Beowulf, The Story of Hong Gildong, The Blazing World, the Ramayana, and many others &mdash; can also easily be seen as fantasies, horror stories, and fictions based on then-current science.

Volume two of Françoise Mouly and Nadja Spiegelman’s comics anthology Resist! Grab Back! was sitting in the free stacks at Phoenix Comics last night. Even though it says “FREE” in big block letters on the front of the book, it still felt a little like shoplifting to walk off with it: it’s a 48-page full color anthology of anti-Trump comics by cartoonists from around the world. If you were to roll it up, it would likely be thicker than your wrist.

Thursday July 13th: The Dollhouse Reading
The first novel from Fiona Davis takes place in the Barbizon Hotel for Women, a real women’s hotel in 1950’s New York. Women who moved to New York — including Sylvia Plath and Joan Didion — would stay at the Barbizon while trying to get their careers off the ground in a chauvinistic society.

          The Seattle Review of Books doesn&rsquo;t run endorsements, but when a writer runs for office, we notice. In case you missed it, mayoral candidate Nikkita Oliver dropped some verses at last night&rsquo;s Candidate Survivor event at Neumo&rsquo;s.
so um @NikkitaOliver has no competition at @TheStranger &#39;s Candidate Survivor. None. pic.twitter.com/Hn4zrJbwxM
&mdash; heatheronormative (@heatherklus) July 12, 2017 It&rsquo;s not surprising that this happened — Oliver is a teacher and a community leader and an award-winning spoken-word poet, and Candidate Survivor is a nontraditional event co-produced by the awesome Washington Bus — but it&rsquo;s still pretty fucking cool.

          A couple weeks ago, I had the pleasure of talking to a couple dozen young sci-fi writers in the living room of a sorority house in the University District. Those writers were part of the annual intensive writing course presented by local sci-fi writing program Clarion West, and I was part of a panel to talk about book reviewing and publishing. These writers knew exactly the right questions to ask, and their enthusiasm for publishing was infectious.
