          Thomas Friedman has always felt most comfortable analyzing topics from unusually high vantage points. From this perch — his critics would say ivory tower — he is a master at scanning the current terrain of our world, diagnosing where humanity is heading, and offering a roadmap to success.
In Thank You for Being Late, Friedman returns to this tried-and-true formula, focusing his gaze on why our politics and society feel so off-kilter today.

          Maged Zaher says goodbye to Seattle at Arundel Books.

  “After 17 years in Seattle, it's become obvious that I can't hike, I can't bike, and I can't ski. So I'm getting the fuck out,” Seattle poet Maged Zaher joked at his last Seattle-area reading before moving to Atlanta early next year.

          (Every Monday in December, we&rsquo;re asking a local bookseller which books they&rsquo;d like to receive for a holiday gift. Our second bookseller is Melissa Barnes, who works at University Book Store. Melissa chose Ada Twist, Scientist, by Andrea Beaty and David Roberts.)

After reading Iggy Peck, Architect and Rosie Revere, Engineer, I was dying to read this one, because the series is wonderful for parents and kids. I think it’s got a great positive message: Even though someone tells you can’t do something, you can.

          ‘They Are Slaughtering Us Like Animals’ It&#8217;s been a week of interesting and deliberate visual storytelling: this Time Magazine cover, for example, and this selection from the National Geographic 2016 photography contest winners.
But the week&#8217;s must-see is a breathtaking photo essay by Daniel Berehulak documenting the antidrug campaign launched by Philippine president President Rodrigo Dutert in June. In just over a month, Berehulak photographed 57 men and women killed by the police and by vigilantes for real or supposed drug crimes.

Dear Cienna,
After a long string of rejections, I’m happy to report that a short story of mine has finally been accepted. Unfortunately, it was actually accepted at *two* literary magazines, neither of which allow for simultaneous submissions.
