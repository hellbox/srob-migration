Thursday September 29th: Writing for a Cause
At a time when Donald Trump can block newspapers he doesn’t like from covering his campaign, this is more relevant than ever: Journalists Muatasim Qazi, Frederica Jansz, and former Seattle PI reporter Mike Lewis will discuss censorship. Jansz and Qazi both came to US after facing censorship abroad, only to find new threats here.

          The Short Run Comix and Arts Festival has unveiled their schedule of events, and it&rsquo;s a doozy. It begins next week at Elliott Bay Book Company with the launch party for Seattle cartoonist Sarah Glidden&rsquo;s brand-new book Rolling Blackouts. I&rsquo;ll be interviewing Glidden onstage about her book, which documents Glidden&rsquo;s travels through Turkey, Syria, and Iraq with several reporters from the Seattle Globalist. I hope to see you at Elliott Bay next week, and I hope you&rsquo;ll consider attending all the Short Run events over the next two months.

          I agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that Jonathan Hickman’s series Secret Wars was a high point for Marvel Comics — it was the culmination of a time in which Marvel seemed to be doing new things with its superhero comics, exploring old concepts with fresh eyes. At roughly this time last year, Marvel Comics felt as though it was humming with possibility; as Marvel&rsquo;s films came to dominate the blockbuster box office, the comics division seemed ready to move forward into a new age.

          The first time I encountered the ravaging effects of post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD was when my husband went into surgery for a rare cancer and came out without any memory of our life. He died on the table that night, but his body remained. He had an anoxic insult, a brain injury, and he lost much of the ability to remember what happened yesterday or ten minutes ago. And surprisingly, he lost something most didn’t at first recognize was possible to lose in a cancer treatment &mdash; the long-term memories of his life.

          Wave Books has, in a relatively short span of time, become the second best poetry publisher in the Seattle area. The best, in case you’re new to town, is Port Townsend nonprofit publisher Copper Canyon Press; given that they’re probably the best poetry publisher in the country, there’s no shame here in a second-place finish.
And besides, Copper Canyon and Wave Books traffic in very different styles of poetry. Copper Canyon publishes, for lack of a better word, traditional poetry, which is to say they publish poems with the structure and the heft of generations.
