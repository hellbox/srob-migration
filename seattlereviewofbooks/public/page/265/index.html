Today is the 152nd birthday of Nellie Bly, whose real name was Elizabeth Cochran Seaman. Bly was a journalist in the early 20th century, best known for an undercover investigation into the horrid conditions of mental hospitals, and for an around-the-world trip, to realize the fictional travels of Jules Verne&rsquo;s Around the World in Eighty Days (she did it in seventy-two).

It&rsquo;s not every day (or even every year) you get to celebrate the grand opening of a new Seattle bookstore. You can (and should) confirm that you&rsquo;ll be there on the Facebook invite for the weekend.
 Save the date, part 2: on June 2nd, you&rsquo;ll get a sneak preview of a new reading series hosted and curated by Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore.

 If you’re looking for a good book, try the FCBD edition of the first issue of *Archie*, by Mark Waid and Fiona Staples. I reviewed it when it came out back in July of last year.

Last week, we interviewed new-to-Seattle author [Neal Bascomb](http://nealbascomb.com/) for [our New Hire column.]( http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/26/new-hire-neal-bascomb-found-a-community-of-writers-in-seattle/) Yesterday, Bascomb’s newest book, a non-fiction Norwegian World War II espionage thriller called [*The Winter Fortress*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780544368057), was officially published. Bascomb is hosting a [launch party at Hugo House tomorrow night](https://hugohouse.org/event/book-launch-party-neal-bascombs-winter-fortress). We talked about the pleasures and pains of research and why his book might appeal to fans of the movie *Red Dawn*.

Seattle is right now trapped in the nether realm between openly mourning the past (see editor Jaimee Garbacik’s Ghosts of Seattle Past project) and openly agitating for the future (see the conversation about how quickly we can get light rail up and running to Ballard.) Tonight, the Hugo House finds itself exactly in between those two polar Seattle extremes, as a kind of Schrödinger’s nonprofit writing center. In twelve days, the House moves to its temporary headquarters on First Hill as a two-year guest of the Frye Art Museum while the old structure is demolished to make way for a shiny new facility at the base of five stories’ worth of condos.

        <div class="content">
          Okay, so yesterday the GiveBIG website collapsed and died a very public death. Dozens, or hundreds, or thousands of Seattleites who wanted to donate money to their favorite Seattle-area nonprofits were unable to, and those nonprofits were forced to choose between either waiting out the computer problems or sending people to their own sites to donate. (The problem with the latter choice: donations directly to nonprofits wouldn&rsquo;t have access to the large amount of matching funds that are applied to donations through the GiveBIG site.

        <div class="content">
          We&rsquo;re always excited to promote GiveBIG every year, but this year it seems that the website is having serious issues. As in, it&rsquo;s impossible to donate through the GiveBIG site right now. Many nonprofits are reporting not receiving donations in over an hour, and the Seattle Foundation&rsquo;s calls for people to &ldquo;refresh&rdquo; the site don&rsquo;t seem to be working.
In short: GiveBIG this year is pretty much a clusterfuck. There will for sure be hell to pay in the coming days — this is a big day for Seattle&rsquo;s nonprofit community and this will surely affect the annual income of local organizations across the board.
