        <div class="content">
          Piecing together the Sunday Post is usually easy and a pleasure; in fact, it&#8217;s an excuse and justification for the most idle pleasure possible: endless scrolling through the world of online content, mind half alert, fingers on autopilot.
But the Internet after the inauguration of our 45th president is no place for the idle or unalert. As much as Donald Trump has dominated the media, social and otherwise, since his presidential bid began, this week has been different.

Theaters have a special place in the history of cities. It's more than memory, although I've certainly seen some notable performances at the Moore Theater over the years (odds are pretty good you have as well).

          I keep asking myself: What sequence of events, in all human history, was stranger, more bizarre, more tragically ridiculous than this?
&mdash; William Gibson (@GreatDismal) January 20, 2017 Things are getting weird. Yesterday, I noticed a certain panicked expression on the faces of commuters. People answered the question &ldquo;how are you?&rdquo; by averting their eyes and mumbling that they&rsquo;re doing okay, considering everything. You know that moment when you suddenly realize that you&rsquo;ve been clenching your jaw for the last 24 hours?

Dear Cienna,
There’s a local writer I hate. You’d know his name. He’s awful. Sometimes I have to get into the comments and tell him how much I hate his writing, and sometimes I know I go overboard.

          Marcel Duchamp’s great work, The Large Glass depicts an abstract scene. The full title: The Bride Stripped Bare by her Bachelors, Even. It’s conceptual and heady: “…nobody fully understands The Large Glass” says Duchamp’s biographer Calvin Tomkins.
Duchamp said it wasn’t a painting, but a “delay”: “a delay in glass as you would say a poem in prose or a spittoon in silver,” he said. “The Bride is basically a motor,” he said.

          Thanks to Seattle Review of Books readers Joey Pillow and @Polypodiaceae for catching our cameo appearance on tonight&rsquo;s Late Night with Seth Meyers, starting at the six minute mark in the video below:
 Seth Meyers has been a fantastic late night host during the 2016 presidential election and its aftermath, and we&rsquo;re thrilled to be a resource for the show. Too bad it had to be during a segment about how our incoming president is borderline illiterate.

**Looking for Betty MacDonald Reading**
Betty MacDonald’s 1945 memoir about life on the Olympic Peninsula, *The Egg and I*, is an underappreciated Northwest classic. Seattle-area historian Paula Becker celebrates the UW Press’s republication of three long out-of-print books by MacDonald with a reading from her book which celebrates MacDonald’s history and legacy.
