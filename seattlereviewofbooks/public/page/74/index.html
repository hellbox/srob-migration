        <div class="content">
          We&rsquo;re so used to the modern incarnation of shooting coverage that we never think about how odd it truly is. Things always begin with reports on Twitter of gunshots, followed by dribbling pieces of &ldquo;news&rdquo; — some true, many false — from eyewitnesses and local news reporters. The body count goes up and down, depending on the source. Eventually, we learn about the shooter — always a man, usually with a domestic violence incident or two in his past — and people mumble about his motive and send their respects for the dead before their attention turns elsewhere.

          Amazon grew its book business in large part due to showrooming: ask any bookseller and they&rsquo;ll tell you horror stories of customers flipping through books, looking the title up on Amazon, and buying the book on their phone just before leaving the bookstore empty-handed.
But things have changed over the years. Amazon owns and operates several brick-and-mortar bookstores in cities around the country. They just bought Whole Foods. And so naturally they&rsquo;re getting concerned about showrooming, themselves.

          No writer in Seattle is more interested in the raw physicality of words than Doug Nufer. Nufer is interested in the shape of words, the multiple meanings they carry, the sound of them when spoken aloud, the look of them when aligned on the page next to each other. The meat and bones of words — before even the meaning imbues them with a kind of soul — fascinates him.

          Henri had ‘no other teacher

Sponsor [Sagging Meniscus](https://saggingmeniscus.tumblr.com/post/157711883631/announcing-sagging-shorts) wants to make sure you've got this Thursday on your calendar: Seattle writer and poet Doug Nufer will be reading from his new book _The Me Theme_ at Gallery 1412. More details, and a link to the event, on our sponsor's page. You&rsquo;ve seen Doug&rsquo;s name plenty of times on the site. He&rsquo;s a formal constraint-based writer, making some of the most interesting, and compelling, and challenging (in the best possible way) work.

        <div class="content">
          At Literary Hub, Stacie Williams writes about what it means to be a librarian:
In 1962, British librarian Douglas John Foskett wrote a paper titled *The Creed of a Librarian: No Politics, No Religion, No Morals*, in which he argued that “the librarian ought virtually vanish as an individual person, except in so far as his personality shed light on the working of the library.” Neutrality has been enforced from the top down, with our policymaking professional organizations, down to individual librarians in their repositories, as a way of shifting the responsibility of moral judgement from librarian to patron.

Charles Johnson has been one of the most influential members of Seattle’s writing community. He’s contributed to the community in a number of ways — as a professor at the University of Washington, as a writer, as a friend to writers. Johnson recently joined the writing and literacy nonprofit [Seattle 7 Writers](http://www.seattle7writers.org/), which donates to literacy organizations and donates books to readers around the region in shelters, detention centers, food banks, and other locations where people have need of good literature.
