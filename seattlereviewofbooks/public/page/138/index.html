Sponsor Northwest Associated Arts is bringing David Sedaris to the Broadway Performance Hall for eight performances over seven days. This is astonishing on its own, but even better? Sedaris will be workshopping his new novel _Theft by Finding_ — this is your chance to see inside his creative process.
There&rsquo;s more information on our sponsor&rsquo;s page, or you can buy tickets — we suggest you grab some before all the performances are sold out, as of this writing, half the dates already are.

          A free Brooklyn-based comics newspaper called Smoke Signal — the same magazine that partially inspired Seattle&rsquo;s late, lamented Intruder comics paper — is publishing a special anti-Trump comics paper called Resist! Published in time for Inauguration Day and with a print run of over 30,000 copies, Resist! ought to make a splash as one of the first artistic protests of President Trump. Resist! is edited by Raw co-founder Françoise Mouly and Nadja Spiegelman, and it seeks to publish (mostly women-produced) comics &ldquo;on the theme of political resistance to the forces of intolerance.

          This is unprofessional for a critic, but I have to gush: I loved reading Claudia Rankine’s book Citizen: An American Lyric. I love everything about this book: I love the look of it, the feel of it, the words and the design and the passion and the craft of it. Citizen, to me, feels like the future of non-fiction books: a beautiful, book-length essay delivered in raw, vital chunks of text, interspersed with color photos and relevant pieces of art.

        <div class="content">
          Last month’s Reading Through It Book Club was a great success, a night in which nearly a hundred Seattleites gathered to discuss an America that they felt they didn’t recognize anymore. The event — a coproduction between the Seattle Weekly, the Seattle Review of Books, and Third Place Books Seward Park — didn’t provide a whole lot of answers, but it did evoke important questions of class and race and intergenerational poverty.

          On January 1st, Sherman Alexie announced in a Twitter post that he was leaving Twitter. The tweet read, in its entirety:
Hey folks, I'm leaving Twitter because its negatives increasingly outweigh its positives. Thank you for the follows. Some speculated that Alexie&rsquo;s account had been hacked, but Alexie confirmed over email with the Seattle Review of Books that he decided to leave Twitter. His Twitter account appears to have been deleted (or at least deactivated) since that January 1st posting.

          Every week for the last year and a half, we&rsquo;ve presented new poems by Seattle-area poets. It&rsquo;s been a tremendous honor — we&rsquo;ve been proud to pay poets for their work, and to meet so many of the talented individuals who call Seattle home. We hope you enjoy stopping by the site every Tuesday morning to read a new poem. But because it&rsquo;s a new year, we thought we&rsquo;d try something new for our recurring Tuesday feature.
