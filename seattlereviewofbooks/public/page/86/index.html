Last night, Open Books was packed solid with friends, peers, and fans of poet Joan Swift for a combination memorial service/reading to celebrate the life and work of a giant of Northwest poetry.

Something very strange happens when you get a bunch of book people — booksellers and librarians, say — to sit down at a bar with a bunch of people who work with movies, like projectionists and film bookers. Usually, all the book people want to talk about is movies: what’s coming out, what this movie star was like when she visited town for a special screening, what working at a movie theater is like.

        <div class="content">
          Seattle novelist Matt Ruff&rsquo;s excellent novel Lovecraft Country started its life as a pitch for a television show. Now, the Hollywood Reporter says the cycle is complete, as Lovecraft Country (the novel) is heading to HBO. And Get Out director Jordan Peele is producing it, along with J.J. Abrams&rsquo; Bad Robot production company:
The drama — described as an anthological horror series that reclaims genre storytelling from the African-American perspective — hails from Peele's Monkeypaw Productions, as well as Bad Robot and Warner Bros.

        <div class="content">
          Nobody makes writing sound more romantic, important, and magical than a writer, and that’s why writing about writers is a writer’s favorite pastime. Visit any bookstore’s how-to-write section and you’ll find volume after volume that describes writing as an art and a craft and a calling and a sacred trust. A writer can make writing sound like the most important calling in the world, and the only thing writers love to do more than publicly praise the work of another writer is to talk shit about other writers in the bar after the reading.

        <div class="content">
          We&rsquo;ve known for years that Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams is a dipshit men&rsquo;s rights activist. He compares women who want equal pay to children. He&rsquo;s said awful things about consent. He endorsed Donald Trump and praised his &ldquo;clown genius&rdquo; for a year before the election.
Adams may be a jackass, but he is not, strictly speaking, an idiot. He&rsquo;s kept his politics out of his comic strip, because he understands that people like Dilbert for its inane &ldquo;boy-oh-boy-bosses-sure-do-suck-am-I-right?

          There is 100 yards of string laid out in a straight line and every ten yards a flower sprouts from stone. The flowers are A. Red. B. Fuschia. C. Yellow. D. White. E. None of the Above. If a boy walks down this path and it is summer and he hums a song from childhood will he pick A, B, C, D or choose E?

        <div class="content">
          You simply must read this New York Times story about a community in Oregon that voted to kill its libraries.
For generations in America, small cities like this declared their optimism and civic purpose with grand libraries that rose above the clutter of daily life and commerce. But last fall, Douglas County residents voted down a ballot measure that would have added about $6 a month to the tax bill on a median-priced home and saved the libraries from a funding crisis.

Cory Doctorow &mdash; father, skull-collector, multiple award-winning author, BoingBoing blog contributor, and revolutionary advocate for humankind's unrestricted internet access &mdash; appears in Seattle on Monday, May 15, to discuss his latest science fiction novel, _Walkaway_, with friend and fellow award-winner Neal Stephenson. But SRoB columnist Nisi Shawl got him to grant a phone interview first. The (lightly edited) transcription below mercifully does not reflect the technical and recording difficulties overcome; rather it allows you to revel in Cory's deep yet fast-paced flow of thought.
