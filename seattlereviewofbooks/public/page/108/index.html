          I&rsquo;m quoted in this very good short sendoff for the APRIL Festival in this month&rsquo;s Seattle Met, by Darren Davis:  The party may be ending this year with a send-off event, but it leaves having made its mark on the local literary scene. “APRIL took readings out of bookstores and into bars, onto the street,” says Paul Constant of The *Seattle Review of Books*, who started noticing younger crowds at readings after 2012.

Michael DeForge’s new book Sticks Angelica, Folk Hero begins with all the elements of a classic comic strip. You’ve got the flawed main character, Sticks Angelica, a know-it-all chatterbox who, feeling underappreciated by society, moves to the wilderness to be alone. She fancies herself a survivalist: “I run twenty kilometres every morning. On days I don’t bathe, I rub flowers on my armpits.” And she claims to live the life of a folk hero, wrestling bears when she’s bored and devising homeopathic cures for hangnails.

Alternate Wednesday March 22nd: A Constitution for Economic Equality Reading
Law professor Ganesh Sitaraman has long advised Senator Elizabeth Warren on economic matters, making him a leading voice in the battle against economic inequality. Tonight, I’ll be in conversation with Sitaraman about his book, which could very well contain the key for Democratic victory in 2018.

        <div class="content">
          She hurt a man’s ego and there was a war and terrible carnage.
This is Sayantani Dasgupta&rsquo;s nutshell recap of the Hindu story of Draupadi, a girl made of fire, in her book of essays Fire Girl: Essays of India, America, and the In-Between. Draupadi, considered a feminist icon, didn&rsquo;t hesitate to speak her mind, so the miffed male unleashed the forces at his disposal and pretty much wrecked the world.

          UPDATE 3:39 PM: We received word that at the last minute, this edition of Lit Fix has been canceled. Apologies to all.
ORIGINAL POST 9:59 AM: When Mia Lipman moved to Seattle from San Francisco in 2011, she was delighted to find that our city had an “active, supportive literary scene.” But no matter how hard she looked, she couldn’t find her favorite kind of reading: the dive bar cabaret, combining readings with stand-up comedy and musical performances.

        <div class="content">
          Tree Swenson, the executive director at Hugo House, wants to make it clear that the Zine Archive and Publishing Project library was not sold to the Seattle Public Library. She notes that ZAPP managing director Graham Isaac amended ZAPP’s original statement to reflect that fact. Not only that, Swenson adds, but “we haven’t signed anything with the library. There’s nothing that has been signed.”
Stepping back a bit: ZAPP was founded 21 years ago in the Hugo House’s basement.
