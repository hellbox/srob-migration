Seattle&rsquo;s own best-known librarian appears Sunday, at Town Hall. Find out more about her on her website, hear her every week on KUOW, or watch her interview book people on the Seattle Channel (including our very own Paul Constant, back when he was somebody else&rsquo;s Paul Constant).

        <div class="content">
          In the back pages of the first issue of the new series Symmetry, writer Matt Hawkins admits he’s “gotten a bit sick of” dystopia’s omnipresence, and so he decided to try writing utopian fiction, instead. He read Sir Thomas More’s Utopia (“it’s boring as hell,” Hawkins tells his readers, urging them to “skim it”) and embarked on months of research, determining the four qualities of all utopias in fiction (ambition, creativity, diversity, and instruments of capital must be eliminated) and what he believes to be the four pillars of society (community, peace, harmony, and equality are required).

        <div class="content">
          For some time now, City Councilmember Nick Licata has sponsored a neat event at City Hall called the Words&rsquo; Worth Poetry Series. Selected poets would read a poem to kick off City Council meetings. It was a small gesture, but an important one: it&rsquo;s always good to remind the City Council that the arts is what makes Seattle so wonderfully livable.
Today, Seattle poet Sierra Nelson says:
City Councilmember Nick Licata is leaving City Council at the end of this term, and to celebrate his innovative Words’ Worth Poetry Series and legacy of championing the arts in Seattle, current Words’ Worth curator, poet and performer Sierra Nelson, has invited past curators and readers to return to Seattle City Hall (600 4th Ave, City Council meeting room) on Wednesday, December 9th, 2015, 2:00-2:15 p.

          Words in Air, the correspondence between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell, is one of the books I’m never entirely not reading. I pick it up all the time, and it’s always better than I remembered. There is a unique effect of these writers, their letters soothe my mind, the way the exact right word can be both calming and exciting no matter the topic. Their letters make being a person seem like a reasonable way to spend time.

          Ask a thousand booksellers what you should buy as a gift for the holidays and you’ll get a thousand different answers. There’s no single perfect gift. But Letizia, a bookseller at University Book Store, is really excited about Sandra Cisneros’s book A House of My Own, and she thinks you should be, too.
![](/webhook-uploads/1449611731764/content.jpg)
Letizia’s voice bubbles over with enthusiasm for House. It’s “a collection of essays, articles, and non-fiction stories” that Cisneros has “compiled and collected over the past 30 years.

          As Paul previously mentioned, we&rsquo;re teaching a class at Hugo House about book reviewing. We&rsquo;ve already met a few nice folks who have signed up, and we&rsquo;d love it if you were there as well.
Registration for Hugo House members was open a week ago, but now anybody can sign up. We&rsquo;re going to have a lot of fun in this class &mdash; you&rsquo;ll walk away with a deep understanding of reviewing, and with a number of finished reviews on books you feel passionately about.

        <div class="content">
          Margaret Atwood&rsquo;s first comic is called Angel Catbird, it&rsquo;s an all-ages story about a hero who gets his genes spliced with a bird and a cat, it comes out fall 2016 from Dark Horse Comics, and it&rsquo;s illustrated by the talented Johnnie Christmas, who drew the Image series Sheltered. Sounds weird. I&rsquo;m in.

        <div class="content">
          Here&rsquo;s some good news on a downright gloomy day. We just got word from the good folks at Short Run Comix and Arts Festival that the National Endowment for the Arts awarded them a grant for their 2016 festival. (It&rsquo;s been a good couple days for Seattle&rsquo;s standing in arts awards.) A quick search of the paperwork reveals that Short Run was awarded $15,000 by the NEA. Other local winners include SIFF, the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, the Seattle Opera, and, on the literary side of things, Town Hall Seattle, which also picked up $15,000.
