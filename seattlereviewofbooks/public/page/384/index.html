**Dear Cienna,**
My mother just came out as Wiccan at 62. Dead serious. What the fuck am I supposed to do about this? Is there any book in the world that can help me unfuck this pile of candles and Stevie Nicks lace?

        <div class="content">
          At a time when reality TV continues its relentless portrayal of Alaska as a source of extreme and outlandish (even ridiculous) behavior, author Heather Lende consistently reminds readers that it is actually a place populated by people, just like anywhere else. As the newspaper obituary writer for the small town of Haines, (population about 2,000), Lende has written for years about ordinary people who have quietly lived extraordinary lives. She shared some of these stories in her first book, If You Lived Here, I’d Know Your Name and then, after suffering horrific injuries when she was hit by a truck near her home, wrote a memoir of her recovery, Take Good Care of the Garden and the Dogs.

          Last night at Ignite Seattle, I officially announced the Seattle Review of Books&rsquo;s newest feature: the Resources page. On this page, you&rsquo;ll find dozens of ways to get involved with Seattle&rsquo;s literary community: literary magazines, open mic nights, literary news sources, book clubs, literary happy hours, places to volunteer, places to take classes. If you&rsquo;re new to town or you&rsquo;re just looking to get a little more serious about your commitment to literature, you&rsquo;ll find all sorts of ways to join the literary scene.

        <div class="content">
          Yesterday, Denzel Washington announced that he&rsquo;s going to produce adaptations of all ten plays in Seattle playwright August Wilson&rsquo;s Pittsburgh Cycle for HBO over the next ten years. This is a hugely ambitious project, and we look forward to Wilson staying at the top of the cultural conversation for another decade because of it.

          Everybody&rsquo;s talking about Mira Jacob&rsquo;s BuzzFeed story &ldquo;I Gave A Speech About Race To The Publishing Industry And No One Heard Me,&rdquo; and for good reason: it&rsquo;s a substantial look at one of the publishing industry&rsquo;s biggest problems. Jacob was invited to be the keynote speaker at a Publisher&rsquo;s Weekly gathering:
My last year has been intense. My book *The Sleepwalker’s Guide to Dancing* came out, I spent a few months touring internationally, and from a distance, it looked like one big party.
