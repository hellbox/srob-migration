          Our thanks to Floating Bridge Press for their sponsorship this week. They&rsquo;re showing off 2015 chapbook award winner Michael Schmeltzer, and his winning work Elegy/Elk River. The titular poem is available to read on our sponsors page, and it is an amazing piece of work. His accolades are well deserved.

          Ron Charles at the Washington Post writes that Scholastic&rsquo;s decision to recall their children&rsquo;s book A Birthday Cake for George Washington is being protested by the National Coalition Against Censorship. (If you need a primer on the swirl around Birthday Cake, you should read Lisa Gold&rsquo;s excellent review, which we ran last week.)

          MONDAY What better way to kick off your week than a brainy talk about aspirational science? Head to Town Hall Seattle for Oliver Morton, reading from his new book, The Planet Remade: How Geoengineering Could Change the World. It’s about how “an increasing number of climate scientists are advocating for more proactive human intervention in the biosphere,” which can mean anything “from cultivating photosynthetic plankton to seeding clouds with fleets of unmanned ships.

 In January 2011, days after the first uprising in Tunisia and the protests in Tahrir Square, the Guardian invited leading writers from across the Arab world to reflect on the revolutionary fervour sweeping the region. Then, they expressed great optimism for the future.
