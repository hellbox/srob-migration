          Every 16-year-old in Sweden is getting a copy of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s *We Should All be Feminists*.The book, which was adapted from a TED talk Adichie—the author of *Americanah*, *Half of a Yellow Sun*, and two other works of fiction—gave in 2012 will be distributed to the country’s teens by the Swedish Women’s Lobby and publisher Albert Bonniers. The Swedish translation was released on December 1.  What a wonderful idea.

          Escaped serial killers, wives behaving badly, psychics getting embroiled in police work, and all in our own back yard? Gregg Olsen brings it all in his second book in the Waterman/Stark series.
We&rsquo;re so pleased to have him as a sponsor this week, and you can read a full chapter from his new book Now That She&rsquo;s Gone on our sponsor page. You&rsquo;ll be glad you did.
It&rsquo;s because of sponsors like Olsen that we were able to sell-out our initial run of sponsorship slots.

          I&rsquo;ve always wondered how art collectors decide which artists to collect &mdash; not the profit driven monsters who play galleries like traders play the markets, but true fans who love art and emerging artists, who show up early and often, and buy many pieces by new talent. But it dawned me while I read Molly Crabapple&rsquo;s memoir Drawing Blood: they learn the artist&rsquo;s story. When you learn someone&rsquo;s story, you forge an empathetic lock with them.

          MONDAY Your week begins at Third Place Books in Lake Forest Park. Tonight, they’re hosting Christopher T. Bayley, author of Seattle Justice: The Rise and Fall of the Police Payoff System in Seattle. For all its political faults, one thing you’ve got to give Seattle: in comparison to east coast cities, it’s remarkably free from corruption. (Many would argue that this lack of corruption is why it’s very hard to get major infrastructure projects done in this town.

          [Jury Duty](https://medium.com/@jurornumber5/jury-duty-b354a53f126e#.6e8l66dws) A remarkable story of jury duty, told by a black man. Very honest, very raw. Very anonymous, for obvious reasons.
There are twelve of us left. The first thing the prosecutor did during voir dire was ask all the men of color whether we trusted cops. Every black man had a story: police harassment, spurious arrests, intimidation. They were all eliminated. I was asked if I had any experiences of this kind, and I said no.
