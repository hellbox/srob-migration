          For anyone who’s ever started a publication of any sort — from a magazine to a blog to a newspaper — this scene from Citizen Kane should be required viewing:
 Charles Foster Kane’s promise to his readers, his “Declaration of Principles,” is something every publisher should emulate. They shouldn’t copy Kane’s declaration (“I will provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.

In the hilarious, and well-loved Cracked! A Magic iPhone Story (four stars on Amazon!), the award-winning Southard (a Seattle denizen) shows you how the geeks of Seattle live, provides a running and often-hilarious social commentary on today’s world, and reminds you that, so long as you have friends, you are never alone.
Help support The Seattle Review of Books by reading her excerpt and ordering the novel if you like what you read.

&mdash; Jim Henley (@UOJim) July 26, 2015 Those only familiar with Watchmen through Zack Snyder’s visually slavish but emotionally hollow cinematic adaptation might not get the irony here. Rorschach was created by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons in the 1980s as an echo of the Steve Ditko character The Question. Ditko is a famous Objectivist, one who believes that heroic fiction should only follow the rules established by Ayn Rand in her fiction and essays.

          _(A collection of pieces we noted this week.)_
[Joe Gould's Teeth](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/joe-goulds-teeth) Jill Lepore writes in The New Yorker about the longest book ever written, and whether or not it actually existed.
There ought to be a “Danger” sign. Writers tumble into this story, and then they plummet. I have always supposed this to be because Gould suffered from hypergraphia. He could not stop writing. This is an illness, a mania, but seems more like something a writer might envy, which feels even rottener than envy usually does, because Gould was a toothless madman who slept in the street.

        <div class="content">
          Hugo House is hosting a one-day poetry broadside workshop Saturday August 8, run by local poet J.T. Stewart, and master typographer John D. Berry. Poets will walk away with printed broadsides of their work.
Broadsides were once the currency of the poetry underground. Learning how to design and print them is a great opportunity, especially if you&rsquo;ve never seen your work come to life on paper right before your eyes. Having this level of experience and guidance available to you is a rare opportunity.
