I&rsquo;m hard-pressed to recall a play that feels more timely than Book-It Repertory Theatre&rsquo;s adaptation of T. Geronimo Johnson&rsquo;s novel Welcome to Braggsville. This play is taking America&rsquo;s temperature at this very second, touching on the so-called political correctness culture of college campuses, America&rsquo;s institutional racism, Southern idolatry of Confederate culture, social media obsession, and much more. Though the book was published in 2015 and the play has been in the works for well over a year, this staging is an incredibly accurate portrait of America in the summer of 2017.

Dear Cienna,
A friend loaned me a book. I wasn’t really into reading it — it was kind of a self-help-y thing. I only took it from her because it was easier than refusing.

Today would have been Octavia Butler&rsquo;s 70th birthday. Butler is considered one of the most influential and important Science Fiction writers of the late 20th century. She came up through the Clarion Workshop, where there is now a scholarship in her honor to support writers of color.

          The following is an email we received from a reader named Joaquin de la Puente:
**A question for Paul Constant: I just read [your review of Josh Bayer's *Atlas* #1]( http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/06/08/thursday-comics-hangover-is-this-the-ugliest-comic-in-the-world/) and found it uninformed and irresponsible. You didn't seem to research this book or the line that it is a part of. The entire All Time Comics universe is written by Josh Bayer who is a lauded and prolific figure in underground comics.

          Yesterday, Seattle&rsquo;s outgoing Civic Poet, Claudia Castro Luna, announced the publication of her Seattle Poetic Grid. It&rsquo;s a map of the city, with site-specific poems interlaid over it. I encourage you to go check it out; there&rsquo;s lots of good stuff there, from classic seattle poems by Richard Hugo and Denise Levertov to newer poems by Julene Tripp Weaver (about University Village, of all places) and Elizabeth Austen and Lena Khalaf Tuffahha.

        <div class="content">
          Ever since Socrates asked that Homer be censored and the poets be exiled from his beloved republic, philosophy and poetry have been on less than civil terms. Hegel, for example, thought that poetry was no longer up to the task of representing the Absolute, and therefore must give way to philosophy. On the side of the poets, Keats, in his lengthy poem “Lamia,” condemns “cold philosophy” for her removal of beauty from the world.
