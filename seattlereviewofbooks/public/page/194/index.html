          Cienna Madrid is taking Labor Day weekend off. She will return next week. If you can&rsquo;t go a single Friday without a Help Desk — believe me, I know the feeling — we have a year&rsquo;s worth of columns here for you to enjoy. On a related note: we at the Seattle Review of Books hope you have a fantastic Labor Day weekend. We&rsquo;ll see you at Bumbershoot this Sunday!

          Thinking about moving to Tacoma to save on rent? Wondering if you should wear the polka dots or the stripes? Curious about whether you&rsquo;ll be alone for the rest of your life? If you have a question you&rsquo;d like to have answered on stage at Bumbershoot, you should tweet it at Hugo House with the hashtag &ldquo;#Oracle&rdquo;. Your question might be addressed by Garth Stein, Ijeoma Oluo, or Kristiana Kahakauwila; they will be divining responses from their published writings.

        <div class="content">
          You’ve seen this future before. Lucas Varela’s new comic The Longest Day of the Future is stuffed full of familiar sci-fi tropes: future humans walk around their future cities wearing sexless jumpsuits, unless they’re mad scientists in white lab coats and goggles. Aliens have giant skulls and fly around in saucers. Robots are comical figures with telescoping arms. Fleshy pink tentacles leap out at you when you least expect them. Portals enable instantaneous travel anywhere on Earth, and even into other dimensions.

          In a Paris Review interview, Cynthia Ozick, then fifty-two, confesses to her incredulous interviewer, Tom Teicholz, that she has no audience:
 &hellip;I want to be read. I know I can’t be “popular,” and I regard this as a major failing&hellip;but&hellip;.[v]ery few people read me&hellip;  Some might interpret this as writerly anxiety or false modesty because the work of few contemporary authors has as serious a readership among the literati.

          **Wednesday August 31: I Will Send Rain **
Rae Meadows’ fourth novel, I Will Send Rain, is set against the backdrop of the mid-1930s dustbowl. It’s the kind of impressive, intensely researched work that reinvigorates an author’s career. Meadows shares the stage tonight with Seattle author Martha Brockenbrough, author of The Game of Love and Death. Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, elliottbaybook.com . Free.

During all the hoopla over Paul Allen’s Upstream Music Festival coming to Pioneer Square next year, I had to wonder why Allen didn’t just invest in Bumbershoot instead. Two years ago, Bumbershoot found itself in real financial trouble, and One Reel, the non-profit organizer of the festival, had to partner with AEG Live, the (decidedly for-profit) concert promoter, to keep the festival afloat. This pairing has caused a lot of consternation from Bumbershoot fans.

          One day in the not-so-distant future, Americans will look back on the way we currently treat our prisoners with shame and regret. Over-incarceration abounds — particularly of African-American and Hispanic men — and rehabilitation is barely an afterthought. Drug crimes are still hugely over-represented (as of 2014, half of all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in prison were there due to the War on Drugs) and the race and class issues in our prison system are so glaringly obvious that to call them “subtext” would be insulting to the very concept of text.

          Just a reminder that we are very excited about the Seattle Review of Books showcase happening at Bumbershoot this Sunday at 7:30 pm. We&rsquo;ll be presenting poets EJ Koh and Robert Lashley onstage with poet, novelist, short story author, and all-around Seattle literary lion Sherman Alexie. We hope to see you there.
 Wallingford&rsquo;s wonderful Open Books closed yesterday and will remain closed for about two weeks because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;transition time,&rdquo; which means old owner John Marshall will be officially handing over ownership to Billie Swift.
