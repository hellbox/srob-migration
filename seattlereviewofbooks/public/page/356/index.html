          So, how&rsquo;s progress? If you&rsquo;re on track, and getting your nut in every day, you should be about 10,000 words today. If you&rsquo;ve cracked that milestone — congratulations! That&rsquo;s huge. If you haven&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t despair. Buckle down over the weekend and get some hours in. This is the time to make it happen. Your book can&rsquo;t be read until you&rsquo;ve written it.
Today we&rsquo;re going to cover the sine wave that is a writer&rsquo;s mood when penning a novel.

**Dear Cienna,**
I can&rsquo;t remember if my anger and frustration with Amazon began when I heard about the &ldquo;gazelle&rdquo; project, or when I heard about their total lack of philanthropic investment in our city, or what, but by the time the Hachette e-book price wars started up, my rage had reached a boiling point, and with the opening of their stupid bookstore, I am just seething.

          The Associated Press says:
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Chile's government is acknowledging that Nobel-prize winning poet Pablo Neruda might have been killed after the 1973 coup that brought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to power.
The Interior Ministry released a statement Thursday amid press reports that Neruda might not have died of cancer.
 The statement, in fact, says it&rsquo;s &ldquo;clearly possible and highly probable&rdquo; that the poet was murdered. Hopefully, at least, morbid curiosity will drive new fans to Neruda&rsquo;s work.

          If you&rsquo;re upset about Tuesday&rsquo;s election results leaning very conservative across the country, you really ought to go to Town Hall tonight. Ari Berman, who was kind enough to do an Election Day interview with us, will read from Give Us the Ballot, his compelling history of the struggle for voting rights in America. Berman will also be in conversation with Washington state Supreme Court Justice Steven Gonzalez about local results and what we can do to increase voter turnout here.

          It&rsquo;s almost time for holiday shopping. But before we get down to the arduousness of — ugh — buying books for other people, you should visit Third Place Books and Third Place Books Ravenna this weekend. On Saturday and Sunday, all used books in both locations are 40 percent off. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite book sales of the year, and a great chance to get some selfish book-buying done before it&rsquo;s time to start thinking of other people again.

          Has anyone yet written a how-to-write book for how-to-write books? If it hasn’t happened yet, we’re probably closing in on that moment in literary history. Lots of people — myself included —enjoy being hypnotized by the soothing rhythm and encouraging cadence of how-to-write guides. After a certain point, all the tips and tricks and affirming quotations blend together into a whirl of positivity, but a good writing guide stands out: Stephen King’s On Writing is one, and Anne Lamott’s Bird by Bird, and John Gardner’s The Art of Fiction, and Natalie Goldberg’s Writing Down the Bones.

          We&rsquo;re in a golden age of Brian K. Vaughan comics. I can&rsquo;t shut up about how good Saga is; he recently wrapped up The Private Eye, a beautiful sci-fi comic with Marcos Martin; his Canadian future war comic We Stand On Guard keeps getting better; and his newest series, the retro sci-fi adventure comic Paper Girls, is probably his best non-Saga comics work yet. Co-created with artist Cliff Chiang, Paper Girls tells the story of a group of newspaper delivery girls in 1988.

          Burglars stole nearly a thousand dollars from the delightful Couth Buzzard Books on Greenwood Ave over the weekend, reports Phinneywood.com. That&rsquo;s a lot of money, especially for a store that&rsquo;s still a month away from the holiday rush. On the Couth Buzzard Facebook page, owner Theo Dzielak writes:
Some of you have asked how you can help. Well, come on by and say hello, grab a great drink, some food and check out our great selection of new and used books.

        <div class="content">
          Yesterday saw an avalanche of think-pieces and first-person accounts of the launch day for Amazon Books, the online retailer&rsquo;s first physical bookstore in University Village. The most notorious of these hot takes was Megan Garber&rsquo;s piece for the Atlantic, titled &ldquo;Did Amazon Just Replace the Public Library?&rdquo; I honestly can&rsquo;t tell if Garber&rsquo;s piece is supposed to be a joke or a troll or not. It certainly reads like it&rsquo;s trying to be funny.
