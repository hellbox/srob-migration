        <div class="content">
          Oh, hey — here&rsquo;s a terrible idea:
To that end, [Barnes & Noble Chief Executive Ron] Boire is leading a push to rebrand Barnes & Noble as more than just a bookstore by expanding its offerings of toys, games, gadgets and other gifts and reshaping the nation’s largest bookstore chain into a “lifestyle brand.” You might argue that Barnes &amp; Noble won&rsquo;t be able to survive by just selling books. I would refute your argument by pointing out that Barnes &amp; Noble stores are already stuffed to the rafters with cheap plastic crap.

          Now is the time to apply for the Clarion West summer workshop. Yes, it does cost money to apply (though it costs less to apply now than it will cost later on) but Clarion West is maybe the best education organization in America for aspiring sci-fi and fantasy writers. And their mission statement is so goddamned good:
Speculative fiction — science fiction, fantasy, horror, magic realism, and slipstream — gives voice to those who explore societal and technological change, along with deeper considerations of underlying archetypes of human experience.

          Even if you made 50,000 words and finished NaNoWriMo, your novel isn&rsquo;t finished yet. You knew this already, right? You know what the haters say: that NaNoWriMo unleashes thousands of terrible novels into the world. It&rsquo;s as if some evil force were holding those poor people captive, forcing them to read every cliched phrase that comes in front of their eyeballs. It&rsquo;s as if they have no taste.
But, of course, the little secret of NaNoWriMo is that it doesn&rsquo;t unleash terrible novels into the world.

          We&rsquo;re generally in favor of awards here at the Seattle Review of Books. We don&rsquo;t put too much truck in them — awards are not the end of a certain type of literary conversation; they&rsquo;re the beginning. But (as long as they don&rsquo;t overly favor straight white men) awards are fun, and it&rsquo;s nice to publicly recognize the hard work that goes into the writing of books.
There&rsquo;s one award we don&rsquo;t much like, though.

          We&rsquo;re big fans of Seattle poet EJ Koh, and we think you should be big fans of EJ Koh, too. If you need an introduction, you should read this interview with Koh published in Hoctok. I especially like that the interview is broken up with Koh&rsquo;s poetry; it&rsquo;s surprising that more literary interview outlets don&rsquo;t liberally intersperse their interviews with actual examples of the writers&rsquo; work. Seeing an author&rsquo;s thoughts and words in such close proximity to each other provides a more immersive experience for the reader.

        <div class="content">
          Michel Houellebecq is a terrible person. He is also, if his translators have done their job correctly, an excellent writer. This isn’t a rarity — plenty of writers are awful people. But unlike many of the worst people who write, Houellebecq doesn’t try to conceal his awfulness. Instead, he revels in it.
Houellebecq has made a career out of provocation. His essay praising H.P. Lovecraft’s ahuman tendencies is probably the best critical reappraisal of Lovecraft ever written.
