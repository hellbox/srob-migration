        <div class="content">
          Our thanks to sponsor Donald Kentop. His book,Frozen by Fire, examines the 1911 Triangle Factory Fire in verse. Kentop will be appearing this Sunday, November 15th at 2:00pm, at the Ballard branch of the Seattle Public Library to read from this impressive work.
You can read two poems from the book on our sponsor page. We encourage you to support local poets and artists, and taking a moment to look on our sponsor page is one easy way to do that.

This week, Rahawa appeared, reading some of her own stories, on the Catapult podcast. You should spend some time there, so that when you read these posts on Saturdays, you&rsquo;ll hear Rahawa&rsquo;s voice when you read her tweets.

          If you&rsquo;re doing your job, and are on target, by Sunday you&rsquo;ll be at a magic place: halfway. Oh my, how good it feels to cross that 25,000 word line. Some of you have already flown past it, so know the feeling.
Some of you probably feel like you&rsquo;ll never reach it and the whole thing is hopeless. It&rsquo;s not. If you&rsquo;ve written 10,000 words this whole month, you&rsquo;re 10,000 words into a novel that didn&rsquo;t exist on Halloween.

I&rsquo;m friends with a man who claims to ironically love the writings of Tucker Max. He seems like a sweet guy, but is he secretly nursing an inner bro?

          Very sad news: we&rsquo;ve received word from her literary executor that Madeline DeFrees, a Seattle poet, passed away last night. She would have been 96 years old next week.
DeFrees was widely celebrated, including a Guggenheim Fellowship in Poetry and two Washington State Book Awards. Her most recent collections were published with Copper Canyon Press. According to her website, DeFrees &ldquo;spent 38 years as a nun with the Catholic Congregation of Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary.

          If you were watching NBC News last week you have may have noticed a segment about the Amazon bookstore opening in Seattle. In that clip, you may have seen our own Paul Constant giving his (our, really) opinion on the matter.
But we didn’t know until today (despite nice friends letting us know) that the video played on national NBC News, not just King5. Today we uncovered the video in question, and are offering it for you here, in the least timely way possible, so that you, like us, can cheer when you see our website appear on that master of all media, big television.
