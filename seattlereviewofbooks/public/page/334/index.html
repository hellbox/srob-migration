          [Men Explain Lolita To Me](http://lithub.com/men-explain-lolita-to-me/) Rebecca Solnit, after writing a piece mocking Esquire&rsquo;s infamous &ldquo;80 Books Every Man Should Read&rdquo;, got things explained to her by white men. Thankfully, she&rsquo;s wonderful at explaining things back. It was hard to find a quote from this essay to pull here, since there were many paragraphs I wanted to quote, but this one in particular I found very affecting:
 There is a common attack on art that thinks it is a defense.

          Through tomorrow you can read an excerpt from Eugene M. Babb&rsquo;s stories of the gigging life, Grit and Roses. Babb and Third Place Press are our sponsors this week, and we&rsquo;re absolutely thrilled to have them.
We really loved Babb&rsquo;s direct, lyrical prose, and think you will too. We have two pieces from the book on the sponsor page for you to read. Make sure to do so before Sunday!

          Every day, friend of the _SRoB_ Rahawa Haile tweets a short story. She gave us permission to collect them every week. She's archiving the entire project on Storify.
Since Rahawa is ending this project at the end of the year, this is the third-to-last posting of our wrap-up. Two more to go, and then we launch something new on Saturdays, starting January 10th.

Zombies, zombies everywhere. Who the hell isn’t a little sick of zombies at this point? Even people who love carnage and a little fictional gunplay ought to be getting sick of zombies by now, right?

**Dear Cienna,**
**My granddad died in the spring. He left me all of his books. The gesture meant a lot to me. He used to read to me when I was a baby, and I remember spending hours in his study when I was a kid, flipping through his books.
