          **Wednesday March 29th: The State of Arts Criticism in Seattle **
Doug McLennan, the founder of Arts Journal, talks with a panel of local critics including theater critic Misha Berson, the *Seattle Times*’s Brendan Kiley, former Seattle Weekly editor David Brewster, and, uh, me. We’ll be discussing why art criticism is being cut from local papers and why it’s currently in the hands of mostly middle aged white people. Folio: The Seattle Athenaem, 324 Marion St.

          The Artist Trust Grants for Artist Projects (also known as &ldquo;GAP grants,&rdquo; even though the &ldquo;G&rdquo; in &ldquo;GAP&rdquo; already stands for &ldquo;grants&rdquo;) opened for applications yesterday. These are &ldquo;for artist-generated projects, which can include (but are not limited to) the development, completion or presentation of new work in any discipline.&rdquo; That means if you have a project you&rsquo;ve been dreaming of doing, Artist Trust wants to give you $1500 dollars to do it.

Maybe you’ve never been to an APRIL Festival before. Maybe you’re new to town. Maybe it just didn’t sound like your thing — maybe you don’t like bars, or maybe you’re nervous about going to readings. That’s okay. I’m not going to slather you with wistful sentimentality talking about what APRIL — the name stands for Authors, Publishers, and Readers of Indepdenent Literature – has meant to the city, or what it’s meant to me, in its five years as a literary festival in Seattle.

          Neil Gaiman&rsquo;s sold-out reading at Benaroya Hall is this Sunday. Over at the San Diego Tribune, he talks about his new book, Norse Mythology, which retells Norse myths in more modern prose. Here he talks about a story in which the leader of the gods leads a crusade against foreigners:
I remember being in New York the other day and reading it in the town hall and when I got to the point where Odin says, “**We’re going to build a wall**,” the entire hall erupted.

          Don&rsquo;t forget that this Saturday, from noon to 4 pm, the APRIL Book Fair is happening at Hugo House. 27 local publishers — including the Seattle Review of Books — will have tables full of merchandise for sale. Find a full list of vendors right here.
All I&rsquo;m saying is this: if you&rsquo;re on a budget, and you&rsquo;re thinking about hitting the bars on a weeknight this week, maybe stay home and invest in some literature this weekend.

          I like a little violence
in my poetry
because I don’t trust
the sweetness
of too-ripe words, like
I don’t trust a man
who says, “you’re wonderful”
too quickly.
What would he say
if I told him the sugar
on his tongue
is only what I allow him
to taste?
I used to preen
when a lover called me
easygoing, as if
being no trouble at all
was some kind of glory,
