Tomorrow, Tatiana Gill will release her new comic Wombgenda at the Fantagraphics Bookstore &amp; Gallery as part of the Comics &amp; Medicine Conference. Over the last couple of years, Gill has become one of Seattle&rsquo;s best, and most prolific, autobiographical cartoonists, and Wombgenda collects some of her latest work — most of it related to women&rsquo;s health, but with some current events mixed in.
The three long pieces in Wombgenda address Gill&rsquo;s journey to developing a positive body image, her abortion story, and an account of getting a new IUD at Country Doctor.

It’s a cold and rainy March morning in Pioneer Square, and two men in a dark suite at Clatter &amp; Din recording studios are chasing after a ghost. In the next room over, Sherman Alexie is reading his memoir, You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me, into a very expensive microphone. He’s recording the audio version of Love, which is set to be released in June, but the ghost hunt is getting in the way.

          **Wednesday June 14th: *You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me* Reading**
Sherman Alexie is Seattle’s most entertaining reader, the most famous literary figure from Seattle, and one of our finest writers. And tonight he’s launching the biggest book of his career — a memoir about his complicated relationship with his mother. This reading is sold out, but Town Hall often has standby tickets available at the door. *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave.

        <div class="content">
          Seattle is an international hub of the global and public health communities. Seattle also has one of the mightiest comics scenes in the country. In almost any other year, if you were to sketch out a Venn diagram of those two communities — medicine and comics — there would be very little overlap. But this year, Seattle is host to the eighth annual Comics &amp; Medicine Conference, an international celebration of the communication of medical issues in cartoon narrative form.

          Okay, look: you’ve probably had a bad couple of years and I don’t want to judge your emotional pain. But unless you’re one of the dozen or so music legends who died in 2016, the odds are good that Sherman Alexie has been having a worse time than you.
Alexie’s mother Lillian, with whom he had a very complicated relationship, passed away in the summer of 2015. In the aftermath of Lillian’s funeral, something in Alexie’s heart cracked open and a flood of poems poured out.

          Brooklyn Rail published a great interview with Seattle&rsquo;s own Stacey Levine:  I see novel-writing as an opportunity to ask dozens of questions. The question of self-“realization” is going to be among them, but I like to think a novel is a chance to throw dice that ask combinations of even broader questions. “What is the experience of being alone versus being ‘beside’ somebody else?” And smaller ones: “What is the best way to describe that one sensation?

          In the beginning, it was innocent. Just play. _Let’s mess with Mrs. Flowers’ mailbox!_ Fisher and Price asked me to spy on an old witch they believed lived alone in the woods. _Is her husband dead? Or does she just hate men?_ I wondered. I wondered if she would ever come out of her shack. They tried everything to catch a glimpse of her. Sometimes they fisted worms and mud inside the black hole of it, then pushed the hard red flag up in high salute.

Sponsor [Lori Tsugawa Whaley](http://loriwhaley.com), a third-generation Japanese American, was raised in a primarily Caucasian community and felt disconnected from her Japanese heritage. While exploring this ancient culture, she discovered a source of truth — the code of ethics known as *bushido*. Bushido means “the way of the warrior”; it is the set of chivalrous principles that governed the behavior of the ancient Japanese warriors known as samurai.
Lori Tsugawa Whaley brings these concepts to everyday life, showing through examples the kind of ethical and moral choices you can make when guided by principles.
