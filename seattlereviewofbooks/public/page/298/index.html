          If you only read one group piece about a particular aspect of the publishing industry today&hellip;well, you should read the piece about the whiteness of the publishing industry that I linked to earlier today. But if you have time to read two group pieces about a particular aspect of the publishing industry today, you should definitely read this BookRiot interview with 12 translators about why they love translation.

          The Brooklyn Magazine piece about the whiteness of the New York publishing industry is a must-read, and not just because it prominently features friend of the Seattle Review of Books Rahawa Haile. Go take it all in.

          Two more to go. The 18th issue of Intruder, Seattle’s free, invitation-only comics anthology, is available around town right now, which means only issues 19 and 20 are left before the whole operation folds. Everything seems more acute when a countdown timer’s running, of course, so it’s hard to say for sure, but this issue of Intruder certainly feels more…Intruder-ier than ever before: thicker, full of a wider variety of comics, even livelier than usual.

        <div class="content">
          For Duane Wilkins, University Book Store is a family affair. His mother worked there for over 20 years, and he started shopping there, by his own estimation, somewhere between the ages of 12 and 14. “I think sometimes I work here as karmic payback for what I put booksellers through” as a customer, Wilkins jokes. He used to bombard U Book Store employees with questions — “when is the next book in this series coming out and when is this book coming out in paperback” and so on.

        <div class="content">
          Stesha Brandon has long been one of the most passionate advocates for literary events in Seattle, first in her role as events coordinator at University Book Store and then as program director at Town Hall Seattle. [Today’s announcement that she is the new interim executive director](http://seattlecityoflit.org/blog/) of [Seattle’s City of Literature organization](http://seattlecityoflit.org/) is great news. Brandon brings to the job a steady hand, a proven commitment to the community, and a keen sense of what Seattle’s literary scene needs, as well as a much-needed critical eye and a sterling record of professionalism.
