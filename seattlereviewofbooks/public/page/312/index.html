 The Seattle Weekly&rsquo;s Mark Baumgarten talks with David Brewster about his Seattle atheneum, Folio. I wrote about Folio last fall, and it&rsquo;s now open to the public. If you&rsquo;re wondering whether a paid library/coworking space is right for you, you should drop by and take a look. It&rsquo;s on Marion Street, between 3rd Ave and 4th Ave downtown.
 VIDA updated their excellent list of presses run by women this week.

University Book Store manager Pam Cady is quoted extensively in a piece by Julia Carrie Wong in the Guardian today. Cady says Amazon&rsquo;s brick-and-mortar store is having a serious effect on U Book Store&rsquo;s sales:
“Everyone’s had to adjust to Amazon online,” she says, “but having a store just down the street is a little different. We’re at ground zero. We’re in the blast.” University Book Store is less than a mile away from Amazon Books.

          We live in a dystopian future in which the publishing industry puts out way too many works of dystopian fiction. The shelves of bookstores — young adult sections most especially — are packed to bursting with futures in which teenagers are forced to do battle for the amusement of the wealthy one percent, or in which a grizzled band of people who have seen too many bad things are trying to make their way to the mythical land of California, or in which Donald Trump is on the verge of winning the Republican presidential nomination.

        <div class="content">
          Recently, I visited a comic book store with a friend. She reads all kinds of graphic novels and collected comics, but she’d never spent more than a few minutes in a comic shop. Immediately, it became clear that for people who haven’t spent their whole lives in comic shops, there’s a bit of a learning curve to browsing. She picked up a comic and turned it over, looking for an explanatory blurb, like the one you find on collected comics.

          No? I don&rsquo;t either, but that&rsquo;s okay. Joanna Rothkopf at Jezebel has written a great look back at 1991, when one of our greatest living poets decided to run for president as the only &ldquo;openly female&rdquo; candidate. This story is great for two reasons: First, it&rsquo;s a great story. And second, it caused me to fall down an Eileen Myles-themed YouTube hole.

        <div class="content">
          Deadline reports that Richard Morgan&rsquo;s sci-fi novel Altered Carbon is on track to become a Netflix series.
Altered Carbon is a cyberpunk detective thriller in the style of William Gibson about digital immortality in a world 500 years from now. It&rsquo;s a spectacular, fun novel and you should give it a try. Adaptations are a fine thing — Netflix has a pretty good track record when it comes to their programming — but a year from now, when everybody is talking about Altered Carbon, you&rsquo;re going to want to read the original.
