          You don‚Äôt often recognize the importance of a venue until it‚Äôs gone. If you‚Äôve lived in Seattle for more than five years, you can probably name a now-extinct rock club or bar that played a significant role in your life. Odds are good that you didn‚Äôt even know you‚Äôd miss those places until they closed forever.
Town Hall Seattle is only temporarily closing its doors for a top-to-bottom remodel, but it‚Äôll be out of commission for long enough that we‚Äôll acutely feel its absence.

          Mark Kurlansky‚Äôs non-fiction book about cod, titled Cod, is a critically praised bestseller that‚Äôs bordering on modern-classic status. It‚Äôs easy to forget that when Cod was released in 1997, nobody expected a book about a goddamned fish, of all things, to change the course of publishing. But Cod kicked off a craze of popular books devoted to the history of everyday objects ‚Äî¬†Kurlansky‚Äôs own Salt followed soon after Cod, and other books about screwdrivers and paper and rats tumbled down the pipeline.

          Those special snowflakes in the so-called &ldquo;men&rsquo;s rights movement&rdquo; have targeted Australian bookstore Avid Reader Bookshop for sharing a post by feminist writer Clementine Ford. In response, Avid Reader&rsquo;s social media manager has been working overtime revealing the MRAs for the ridiculous babies they are:

&mdash; Avid Reader Bookshop (@avidreader4101) June 26, 2017 A customer delivered an &ldquo;anti-troll&rdquo; sour cream and walnut cake to Avid Reader&rsquo;s booksellers, which certainly seems like it should become a tradition when the Nattering Nabobs of Nincompoopery target an innocent bookstore for basically no reason.

          When I was a girl
I wanted to live
inside of one.
A wooden, small
place to hold me.
I was in love
with its bird
face. I imagined us
married. The dream
of domesticity. Keeping
house √† la bric-a-brac
or conversation piece.
But time has told
what makes them tick.
More machinations
than magic. Dark
pastoral scenes
and a stiffness
crowns the eaves.
Clockmakers all carve
the same male game

*Love a little, die a little, and break the law. Trey Milligan did them all in one summer, and before his 14th birthday.* Sponsor Frank Murtaugh's debut novel, *Trey's Company*, was just released this month, and we've got a sneak peek to share with our readers ‚Äî [the intro and whole first chapter](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) ‚Äì perfect timing for your summer reading list. Baseball and coming of age are a common pairing; with his background in sports writing and intimate knowledge of the story's locale, Murtaugh brings something special to the mix.

          Hey, Seattle writers! Please remember to apply for the LaSalle Storyteller Award, a fantastic $10,000 award from Artist Trust that goes to &ldquo;an individual literary artist working in fiction.&rdquo; This is a lot of cash with very few strings attached, so it&rsquo;s one of the finer fiction prizes in the region. More information at Artist Trust&rsquo;s site.
 And if you&rsquo;d like to take a writing class this summer, you should know that today is the last day for early bird pricing for any of the Hugo House&rsquo;s summer class schedule.

          WSU Press just published the first book by Bellingham-based historian Candace Wellman. The full title gives you an idea of the topic: _Peace Weavers: Uniting the Salish Coast Through Cross-Cultural Marriages_. It's a book that follows the life stories of four indigenous women who married across cultural lines, making families with pioneer men.
While the fact of cross-cultural marriages was well known, the women in them were ignored, seen as appendages of the men, or cast in racial and gender stereotypes.
