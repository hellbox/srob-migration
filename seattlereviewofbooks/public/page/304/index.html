        <div class="content">
          Congratulations to Sherman Alexie, who is this year&rsquo;s Pierce County Library system selection for Pierce County Reads. The library chose five of Alexie&rsquo;s books for everyone in Pierce County to read. They are: The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven, Reservation Blues, Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, Flight, and War Dances. I wholeheartedly agree; everyone in Washington state should read all of those books.
 Seattle Arts and Lectures is hiring a Program Associate for its Writers in the Schools program.

        <div class="content">
          I love Simon Joyner’s music already — I don’t listen to it all the time, or even every year, though I always come back — but I was unsure about this collection. Lyrics are not, I think, “poems without their clothing,” as Dennis Callaci writes in his introduction to Only Love Can Bring You Peace, Joyner&rsquo;s first book. Dudes: poems are not naked songs. Not everything is purer, more vulnerable when stripped.

        <div class="content">
          Brad Craft, the used book buyer at University Book Store, says he “didn’t grow up in a bookish atmosphere” — he didn’t have access to a good library, and none of his teachers introduced him to the joys of literature. Where did he learn to love books? “Yard sales,” he says. He was especially drawn to a certain type of book: “I’ve read more gothic romance novels than most men my age,” Craft explains.

        <div class="content">
          The rule of thumb about questions in headlines — that most headline questions can be answered, simply, &ldquo;no&rdquo; — has never been more true than in this blog post, which is headlined &ldquo;Are Paid Book Reviews Worth It?&rdquo;
I didn&rsquo;t know that paid book reviews existed, but now I&rsquo;m horrified to learn that they do. Here&rsquo;s the thing: if you&rsquo;re paying for a review, the likely audience of that review is just going to be a bunch of authors who have also paid for reviews.

        <div class="content">
          Last week, Joni Balter was nice enough to ask Steve Scher and me to interview Seattle librarian-legend Nancy Pearl on her show Civic Cocktail. I asked her how she felt about recent anti-book library policies taking root in the Seattle Public Library and in libraries around the country. You can watch the show below:

          343.
Eve of the new year. Bitter cold city. I sit by the café window, bring the soup bowl to my lips. Someone in the park across the street is swinging high on a swing-set in the dark. 344.
At least one keyhole has been stuffed with tissue by a previous tenant. So there is no seeing through. 345.
A very partial morning. The things I am trying constantly to re-make, alter, edit, adjust.
