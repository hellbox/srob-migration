        <div class="content">
          Samantha Pak at the Seattle Globalist has written a great report on diversity in Seattle&rsquo;s bookstore scene. It&rsquo;s a must-read.
 Seattle cartoonist Seth Goodkind discovered that someone plagiarized his artwork in order to win a contest put on by a music festival. When confronted, the artist apologized, but Goodkind wrote a wonderful letter explaining why plagiarism and contests for &ldquo;exposure&rdquo; harm artists. It&rsquo;s publicly posted on his Facebook wall and it&rsquo;s worth your time to read the whole thing.

          **Wednesday June 29: *Know the Mother* Reading **
Desiree Cooper’s short story collection *Know the Mother* examines motherhood in all its complicated variations — mothers of unborn children, mothers of adults, unhappy mothers. Seattle author Tara Conklin’s novel *The House Girl* is a novel about a runaway slave’s legacy. These two should deliver a fascinating conversation about race and gender. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free.

        <div class="content">
          **UPDATE**: Due to illness, the event celebrating author Dorthe Nors that was originally scheduled for this week has been canceled.
Headlines used to be an art form. Newspapers once hired people specifically to condense all the drama and nuance and vitality of a news story into five or six words that could grab readers at twenty paces.
Now the headline has become the domain of the social media expert, and their goals are much more modest: to divert you, however momentarily, from your Facebook news feed.

          When we started the Seattle Review of Books we had two options for trying to fund our content: put ugly ads on every page, or try something experimental with a sponsorship program. There were three points that made this an easy choice:
 Ad rates are falling across the internet. Many sites need to place more and more ad slots just to make the same amount of money they used to.

          Here’s the deal: you are perfectly welcome to tell me that you hate poetry, as long as I’m allowed to hit you upside the head with a copy of Hannah Faith Notess’s collection The Multitude in response.
I’m asking permission to assault you with her book because Notess’s work effectively counters every single one of your arguments against poetry. You say you don’t like poetry because you think it’s too vague?

“We fucking won,” Amelia Bonow announced last night on the corner of 10th and Pike. The crowd around her burst into applause and victorious whoops. These dozens of people had gathered to celebrate the Supreme Court decision that struck down onerous abortion clinic restrictions in Texas. The 5-3 decision, which was delivered a little over twelve hours before the street party, was one of the biggest wins for a woman&rsquo;s right to choose since Roe V Wade.

          Bruise: A Study
I. The bruise begs
in purple tones
for you to think
with your tongue,
for you to listen
with your hands
to the tremulous
voice of my skin.
II. I:
pressed it into my skin, ran into the corner of the counter on my way to make dinner, opened a door in to my shin, let you too close, slammed my finger in the car door, dropped a book on my toe, pushed the baby on the swing and didn’t watch her swing back, had surgery, pinched myself over and over like a pulse, slammed my head against a wall, ignored the warning signs, fell down stairs, fell into you, fell away from you when you pushed, found myself under something heavy.
