Maxx Follis originally created the space that would become Push/Pull at Echo Echo, a collective gallery in Greenwood. She always intended for Push/Pull to be a cooperative space with artists acting as members, but her first call for members only delivered one artist — cartoonist Seth Goodkind. “So when it started out it was just the two of us trying to fill four walls of art” every month or so for a new show, she explains.

        <div class="content">
          According to ThinkProgress, Ursula K. Le Guin wrote an angry letter to the Oregonian in response to what she perceived as a pro-militia front page article.
Ammon Bundy and his bullyboys aren’t trying to free federal lands, but to hold them hostage. I can’t go to the Malheur refuge now, though as a citizen of the United States, I own it and have the freedom of it. That’s what public land is: land that belongs to the public — me, you, every law-abiding American.

          disturbed bodies
(ours)
and on the other side
a moon
possibly&hellip;
watching
 switching pens there
subtle hope
&amp; your tired body
tired
breathing hard&hellip;
to exist
 My minor violence
Toward the gazelle
Is unforgivable
Now making lists
Of the longing that will stay&hellip;
And the longing that
Will be fixed in images
Hatred splits us
But its necessity
Is like water
And love

          A sudden flurry of outraged tweets and blog posts last week led me to A Birthday Cake for George Washington, written by Ramin Ganeshram and illustrated by Vanessa Brantley-Newton, which the publisher touted as “based on real events.” Set in 1790s Philadelphia, where George Washington was serving as America’s first president, the story is about Hercules, Washington’s slave-cook, and is narrated by his young daughter Delia.
Last night, less than two weeks after releasing the book (and only hours after I read it), Scholastic withdrew it and released this statement:

        <div class="content">
          Dalya Alberge writes at The Guardian that a recently uncovered manuscript co-authored by Orson Welles reveals some truths about the friendship between Ernest Hemingway and Welles:
The manuscript, presented in a new study on Welles, reflects his disdain for a type of macho tourist frequently spotted in Spain when mass travel to the country took off in the 1960s. Intended to form the basis of of a love-triangle drama, the script features an American bullfighting aficionado, clearly inspired by Hemingway, as the lead character.
