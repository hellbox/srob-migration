          The wonderful Entre Ríos Books is back as a sponsor, with their stunning book Twelve Saints. The work combines poems about twelve saints with collages built from tintype photographs. The effect is somehow both ethereal and concrete, and aesthetically it is absolutely gorgeous. We have a sample spread on our sponsor&rsquo;s page. The book is reasonably priced, for such a beautiful work, and available at many locations in town, as well as on the Entre Ríos website.

          This weekend, G. Willow Wilson took a public stand against Marvel president Ike Perlmutter for donating $1 million to Donald Trump&rsquo;s weird pro-veteran charity thing. In her post on the controversy, Wilson made a joke about getting fired.
The next day, Wilson picked up an honor that definitely makes the case for her continued employment. Her Ms. Marvel comic won the Best Series award at the Angouleme International Comics Festival. It&rsquo;s the first Marvel comic to ever win the award.

          MONDAY Let’s start our week off with one of the last Works in Progress open mic nights at the Hugo House in its current location. Works in Progress has been going on for years now, and it will undoubtedly stick with Hugo House in their temporary location on First Hill, but there is a certain kind of magic to the Hugo House cabaret space right now, as awkward as it can be when there’s a full house.

          [Maximum Wage: Is technological progress dependent on extreme inequality?](https://howwegettonext.com/maximum-wage-3e21048fc107#.l42rwltna) I&rsquo;ve read many responses to Paul Graham&rsquo;s overly simple Economic Inequality essay. The best, I think, is this by Steven Johnson. Not only is he of tech culture, but he&rsquo;s willing to call out the things that are bad, as well as good. And he has an eye on a great truth of SF culture: it&rsquo;s not all money-grubbing venture capital bros.

        <div class="content">
          Earlier today, the comics world responded to the news that Marvel president Ike Perlmutter donated one million dollars to Donald Trump&rsquo;s veteran event. Of course, if this were a simple donation to a nonprofit veteran association it would be a nonstory, but the fact that Perlmutter donated it to Trump&rsquo;s event made the donation much more morally sticky. The money did not go, as Trump claimed, directly to veteran&rsquo;s needs; it was donated to &ldquo;The Donald Trump Foundation.
