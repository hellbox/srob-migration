The rumors are true: we at the Seattle Review of Books are incredibly excited to be presenting a show at Bumbershoot this year! When Bumbershoot asked us to program an hour on their Words and Ideas stage, we decided to ask three Seattle-area poets known for their awesome performance skills to share a stage for the first time ever. Happily, all three said yes.
EJ Koh wowed us at last year&rsquo;s Lit Crawl with her clarity, stage presence, and incisive poems.

          By the way some people write around here, you&rsquo;d think that only one person wrote around here. I also did a blurb about where I write, for Hugo House. I kept it short, but I did a much more in-depth look at my studio when I ran my Kickstarter last year.
In my studio, I write fiction, I work on the Seattle Review of Books, and I ship copies of my novel California Four O&rsquo;Clock.

          The Hugo House is doing a neat series right now called #WhereWeWrite, in which writers show off the places where they do their writing. Over the weekend, I contributed a post about the hammock where I do a lot of my writing. If you want to discuss your writing process, please share a photo and the hashtag #WhereWeWrite on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or Upsiedaisy, which is a social networking site that I just now made up but which will probably be real by the end of the day.

          Sponsor Floating Bridge Press is back to present 2015 Chapbook Award finalist Brian Cooney, and his book My Idea of Fun. As always, Floating Bridge&rsquo;s Chapbook Award brings out the best in local poetry, and in Cooney they found a poet who is direct, funny, and connected to pop culture in an expressive way.
Like always, you don&rsquo;t need to take our word for it. We have two poems on the Sponsor&rsquo;s page for you to read.

*(Once in a while, I take a new book with me to lunch and give it a half an hour or so to grab my attention. Lunch Date is my judgment on that speed-dating experience.)*
**Who’s your date today?** *All the Birds in the Sky*, the bestselling novel written by i09 editor-in-chief Charlie Jane Anders.
**Where’d you go?** [The Sunlight Café in Roosevelt]( http://sunlightcafevegetarian.com/).
**What’d you eat?** I had the large portion of the blueberry yogurt hotcakes ($9.

          Sometimes when I’m feeling saucy, I’ll ask a bookstore owner to choose a book or two to represent their store. It’s a hard question to answer: how is it possible to reflect the character, staffing, and stock of an entire bookstore with a single book? It’s a question that has broken some booksellers; they shrug, or name a dozen books, or promise to get back to me and never do.

          We reported at the beginning of this month that Open Books owner John Marshall was in the &ldquo;closing stages&rdquo; of selling his poetry bookshop to a new owner. The closing stages have finally closed, and in an email to customers last night, Marshall finally revealed the new owner&rsquo;s name:
We are exceedingly happy to announce that **the next owner of Open Books: A Poem Emporium will be Billie Swift**. She has been an avid customer for years, has a sharp and inquiring mind, and is a truly engaging soul.
