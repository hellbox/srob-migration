        <div class="content">
          We&rsquo;ve written several times about how much we love the children&rsquo;s books of Seattle author Jessixa Bagley. If you&rsquo;d like to hear Bagley discuss her life and work, she guest-starred on the All the Wonders podcast earlier this week. Make sure to check it out.
 You probably know that Fantagraphics cartoonist Matt Furie&rsquo;s cartoon character Pepe the Frog has become a symbol of the Trump-loving alt-right. Furie is by all accounts a wonderful, easygoing guy who was completely blindsided by the fact that his laid-back cartoon frog has become the rough equivalent of a swastika.

**Sunday July 9th: *Nature Poem* Reading**
Tommy Pico is a prominent Brooklyn poet, podcaster, and an editor at the terrific site Literary Hub. He’s in town with his second poetry collection, a book-length poem called *Nature Poem*. To help Pico celebrate his new arrival, Seattle poet Sarah Galvin — one of the very best readers in the city — will join him onstage and read a few poems.

        <div class="content">
          When it comes to Spider-Man, you&rsquo;re either a fan of the Ditko take on the character, or you prefer John Romita. Ditko, of course, created Spider-Man — with some assistance from Stan Lee — but Romita took over the series from Ditko and codified it into the Spider-Man we know today.
It breaks down like this: Ditko&rsquo;s art is weird and a little off-putting and gorgeous. Romita&rsquo;s lines are much cleaner and less complex and more outright heroic.

        <div class="content">
          As a news consumer in the 21st century, I try to measure every piece of political news that flows down my social media streams against two different questions:
 Does this piece paint the politicians in question as mercilessly, cartoonishly evil? As much as I detest Donald Trump, I do not believe that he does things because he wants to be evil. Nobody is the villain in their own stories, and an unrealistic portrait of Trump (and Ryan and McConnell and so on) can contribute to that dreaded “liberal bubble” that pundits warn us all about.

        <div class="content">
          We&rsquo;re throwing a short story writing contest based on our column Seattle Writing Prompts. Better yet, it&rsquo;s being judged by Matt Ruff, author of six novels. His most recent, last year&rsquo;s Lovecraft Country, is being turned into a series on HBO, produced by Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams. The grand prize is $100 and publication here in the Seattle Review of Books, and an interview to appear the same week as your story.
