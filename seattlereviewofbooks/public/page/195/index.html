          Record summer of fire
close to your home &mdash;
a trailer, parked at the confluence
of the Columbia River overflowing
with fish, and tinder dry
Methow Valley. Gone. The water tower,
school, and churches.
Your tortilla comal and family
pictures set in Michoacán, zircon
tiara from a glowing quinceañera,
torched. Smoked too, was your job
tending hilly orchards where apples
caramelized on the branch. Fire left you
stranded like the bear cub

          If you&rsquo;re at all like me, you&rsquo;ve stood in a record store and felt a sick pang in your gut as you realized that you don&rsquo;t own a CD player anymore. Somehow — I blame hypnosis — computer manufacturers tricked us into giving up physical media in exchange for a few millimeters of laptop thinness. We&rsquo;re not buying CDs anymore, we&rsquo;re downloading our audio entertainment. And that goes for audio books, too.

          The Most Exclusive Restaurant In America Though exciting at first, this basement restaurant with a supposed years-long waitlist becomes gradually less legitimate the more you try to learn about it. Journalists can’t confirm celebrity visits and numbers don’t add up. Nick Paumgarten writes about his fifteen course meal with a stubbornly self reliant and secretive chef.
 If Damon Baehrel is in some measure a fairy tale, what, exactly, isn’t true?

          In the beginning of Suite Vénitienne, Sophie Calle writes that for some unknown reason, she started choosing strangers at random on the street and following them without their knowledge. She’d take photos of them and write little notations tracking their movements. Then, her little game escalated:
At the end of January 1980, on the streets of Paris, I followed a man whom I lost sight of a few minutes later in the crowd.
