Sponsor Steve Toutonghi's debut novel _Join_ has just come out in paperback. It's the rarest of SF novels: a gripping concept delivered with compelling page-turning intensity. In the world of the novel, many people can join minds to become a single person. We've got the first full chapter on our sponsor's page, so you can see how Toutonghi deftly weaves this high-concept idea into a great story.
The story follows Chance, a person made of many other people, all living seamlessly as a single entity.

Trump the Destroyer Olivia Nuzzi published a long and detailed profile of Kellyanne Conway this week. It&#8217;s a can&#8217;t-look-away article, somewhere between trainwreck and victory march. (Side note: Like a lot of other people, I&#8217;m pretty sure I could manage to dislike Conway in person.

Oh, those blinking sentinels. I guess I could have written this about the towers on top of Queen Anne, but there's something about the way these three sisters are clustered together atop Capitol Hill, just off Madison, straddling 17th, two on the West, one to the East.

          Conservative sci-fi troll Theodore Beale, who seemed dumb a few years ago when he tried to game the Hugo Awards but now appears to have been a tiny droplet in the imbecilic wave of white male entitlement currently cresting in the culture, is back at it. Beale is currently trolling sci-fi superstar John Scalzi by publishing a book with a very similar title and cover to Scalzi&rsquo;s new novel, The Collapsing Empire.

Dear Cienna,
Not so long ago, I went to a reading. It was an author who, back in his prime, used to be a bestseller. I still think of him as a big name.

        <div class="content">
          This morning, Capitol Hill Seattle&rsquo;s Kaylee Osowski reported that the Elliott Bay Book Company&rsquo;s building has found a buyer. According to present Elliott Bay landlord Hunters Capital, the new landlord wants to keep the bookstore as a tenant. They have not yet revealed the identity of the prospective owner, but they call them &ldquo;local&rdquo; and &ldquo;family-owned.&rdquo;
We have every reason to believe those claims: Elliott Bay has a long-term lease for the space, and Hunters Capital specifically sought them out as tenants back when the store was based in Pioneer Square.

**Friday March 24th: *The Idiot* Reading**
*New Yorker* writer Elif Batuman has only one other book to her name: a non-fiction account of people who are obsessed with Russian novelists. But her debut novel, *The Idiot*—about a Harvard freshman in the mid-1990s who falls in with some questionable Eastern European types—is earning praise from all quarters.
