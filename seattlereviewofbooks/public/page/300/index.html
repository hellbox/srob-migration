          [The Secret Lives of Tumblr Teens](https://newrepublic.com/article/129002/secret-lives-tumblr-teens "The Secret Lives of Tumblr Teens | New Republic") The extraordinarily nutso piece by Elspeth Reeve that everybody was talking about this week.
 Each social media network creates a particular kind of teenage star: Those blessed with early-onset hotness are drawn to YouTube, the fashionable and seemingly wealthy post to Instagram, the most charismatic actors, dancers, and comedians thrive on Vine. On Facebook, every link you share and photo you post is a statement of your identity.

        <div class="content">
          Italian news sources are reporting that author Umberto Eco has passed away. He turned 84 years old last month. Eco is the author of two global bestsellers: Foucault&rsquo;s Pendulum, a playful conspiracy thriller; and The Name of the Rose, a murder mystery set in a Benedictine monastery. I especially enjoyed Eco&rsquo;s underrated 2004 novel The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, a deeply personal tribute to the comics and pulp literature of Eco&rsquo;s youth, as well as a rumination on memory and aging.

        <div class="content">
          Alex Balk at The Awl published a brief post against longform nonfiction storytelling. Here&rsquo;s a quote from the piece, which I think gets the point across with even more brevity: &ldquo;Are there some stories so intricate that they actually demand tens of thousands of words to tell them? Sure. Maybe six or seven a year. Everything else you read is padding or awards-bait.&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s purposefully incendiary stuff, and obviously a broad generalization.

**Dear Cienna,**
I absolutely love Tintin. I have since I was a kid, and still just fall for his outrageous antics. But oh my god, is it racist.

          The author of To Kill a Mockingbird — and, so far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the author of only To Kill a Mockingbird — has died at age 89.
Those who believe the Great American Novel is a singular experience have it wrong; there are many Great American Novels, each a timeless snapshot of a particular moment in American history. Of that tradition of Great American Novels, To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the very best, because it delivered the America that we all — Northern or Southern, black or white, woman or man — aspire to create.

Christine Marie Larsen is off for the next few weeks, no doubt hand-assembling brushes from rarified animal hairs, gathering pigment from the mineraled rocks atop the highest peaks, and making paper from the miraculous cotton rags used to clean the paintings of the old masters in the Louvre.
In her absence, you can always see her work in our archive of the Portrait Gallery. She&rsquo;ll see you all in a few weeks.
