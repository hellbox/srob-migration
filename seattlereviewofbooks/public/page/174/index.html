          Everybody in Seattle is freaking out about the promised weekend wind storm that has whipped Cliff Mass into one of his rare meteorological lathers. Seattle Review of Books readers should know that two scheduled readings with local authors this weekend have been postponed due to weather:
 Priscilla Long’s scheduled Elliott Bay Book Company event celebrating the launch of her two new books, Fire and Stone: Where Do We Come From?

          When news broke that Bob Dylan won the Nobel Prize for Literature, [we published a post questioning the wisdom]( http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/10/13/bob-dylan-wins-2016-nobel-prize-for-literature/) of giving the prize to a world-famous musician. Later that day, *Seattle Review of Books* co-founders Martin McClellan and Paul Constant had a conversation on Slack about whether music should be included in the same context as literature. That conversation turned into an exploration of what literature can (and possibly can’t) do.

          Well, it&rsquo;s been another banner week in the history of our great republic. The democratic process has never seemed so&hellip;well, uh. Yeah.
Maybe the appropriate way to close out your workweek, then, is to listen to KUOW&rsquo;s Elizabeth Austen and Marcie Sillman introduce Karen Finneyfrock&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;The Newer Colossus,&rdquo; which is written from the perspective of the Statue of Liberty. Finneyfrock&rsquo;s version of Liberty is weary. She&rsquo;s seen too many anti-immigration hypocrites, from her island.

        <div class="content">
          Jean Riley wrote a great roundup of the state of independent bookselling in Seattle for Seattle Magazine.  The past few decades have been challenging for independent bookstores, with each decade seeming to bring on a new threat: First, there were the huge chains that dominated the retail landscape. Then, there was the shift to online shopping, followed by the invention of electronic–reading devices. And now, the entry of Amazon into brick-and-mortar territory with its first store in Seattle.

        <div class="content">
          Unlike a lot of male superhero comics readers of my generation, I’ve never been a fan of the Punisher. I always preferred my superheroes to be aspirational. Murdering criminals in the street is something that only criminals do. The Punisher, to me, has always demonstrated the ugly, conservative side of superheroes, where the bad guys are an other—monstrous, irredeemable, worthy of nothing but scorn.
Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips’s new comic Kill or Be Killed is a series about a vigilante who kills criminals, but it’s not a Punisher-style glorification of the genre.

        <div class="content">
          Look, I don&rsquo;t wanna get into a fight over Bob Dylan. But Bob Dylan is inarguably world-famous. Books and countless articles have been written about Bob Dylan&rsquo;s genius. Bob Dylan has won an obscene number of awards. He&rsquo;s made a lot of money.
And I&rsquo;m just saying: Joan Didion still does not have a Nobel Prize in Literature. Or Claudia Rankine. Or Marilynne Robinson. If this was the year for an American to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, seeing one of those names in all the news reports would have made my morning a much happier one.
