          The excellent local literary magazine The James Franco Review, which has a blind submission policy intended to &ldquo;publish works of prose and poetry as if we were all James Franco, as if our work was already worthy of an editor’s attention,&rdquo; published an editorial today that all white editors — ourselves included! — should read and take to heart.

          The editors behind the excellent 33 1&frasl;3 series of books about albums have published all the information collected during their recent open submission process. It&rsquo;s a fascinating look at why the new-arrivals tables at your local bookstore are still dominated by books by and about men.
Of 605 book proposals received, 18.3 percent were written by female authors and 81.7 percent were by male authors. Not even twenty percent of submissions were from women!

          Short Run, the great small-press festival that local author Kelly Froh co-founded, is running a comics summer school every Monday night in August, with classes including how to computerize your art, screen printing, inking, watercolor, and drawing perspective. Each class is very affordable (Short Run is charging anywhere on a sliding scale from five to 20 dollars per class) and hosted by local cartooning greats including Eroyn Franklin, Robyn Jordan, and Max Clotfelter.

          So, a little news. We are shuttering PANK in December &#39;15. It has been a great decade. 1 more print issue, 2 online between now/then.
&mdash; roxane gay (@rgay) July 29, 2015 Literary Twitter — Lit-ter? — is at the moment (and rightfully) more than a little upset about the news that literary magazine PANK is going away.
Friend of SRoB Rahawa Haile puts it best:
I mean do y&#39;all know how many lit mags have black women as publishers?

        <div class="content">
          Ask any writer: the two most difficult parts of the writing process are **1)** sitting down in the seat to write and **2)** figuring out what to write about. We *can't* help you focus on your work, but we *can* try to help you find inspiration in the city around you. That's what Seattle Writing Prompts is all about. These prompts are offered free to anyone who needs them; all the *Seattle Review of Books* asks in return is that you thank us in the acknowledgements when you turn it into a book.

          Piper Daniels interviews excellent local poet Maged Zaher over at the Monarch Review about race, Seattle, and street harassment. It&rsquo;s a must-read. Zaher is more than just one of the best poets in Seattle; he&rsquo;s also one of our most fearless political voices.

          Webcomics are great, but minicomics are satisfying in a way that webcomics will never be able to duplicate. A hand-folded minicomic, especially one still warm from the photocopier, is as intimate and organic as a handwritten letter from a good friend. You can understand why cartoonists made the move from minicomics to webcomics — unlimited distribution, no paper cuts — but you can also understand why some artists still prefer working with ink and paper.

          The Man Booker Prize announced their longlist this morning. The criteria changed last year to be open to international authors writing in English; up until last year, it was solely a prize for writers from the UK commonwealth, Ireland, and Zimbabwe. The longlist is:
Bill Clegg (US) - Did You Ever Have a Family
Anne Enright (Ireland) - The Green Road
Marlon James (Jamaica) - A Brief History of Seven Killings
