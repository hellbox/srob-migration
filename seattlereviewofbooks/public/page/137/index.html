          We&rsquo;ve made a few changes with our weekly columns in 2017. You seem like our new Poet in Residence program on Tuesdays. I love the Saturday Seattle Writing Prompts that Martin has on tap.
And we&rsquo;re changing things up for Monday, too. For the last year and a half, we ran a Bookstore of the Month feature, in which we talked to booksellers, discussed bookstore histories, and talked about Seattle&rsquo;s strong bookstore culture.

In case you missed it [when it was announced in late December](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/12/20/and-the-next-seattle-reads-title-is/), the 2017 Seattle Reads book selection is *The Turner House*, by Angela Flournoy. The Seattle Reads program (which used to be known by the name "If All Seattle Read the Same Book...") delivers hundreds of copies of a chosen book to libraries all around Seattle every spring. In May of this year, Flournoy will do a number of events around Seattle, discussing *The Turner House* in a series of readings and community events.

          He Fixes the Cracked Spines of Books, Without an Understudy In room 111 of the Seattle Public Library central service center, Donald Vass works with glue, iron, paper, and wood to repair books damaged by age, overuse, and mechanical handling. With no apprentice in training, he may be the last to practice the almost medical art of book-mending on our library&#8217;s aging circulation.
And that&#8217;s a shame: not just because the craft is beautiful, but because the practice of repair reflects an attitude of compassion and care that we badly need right now.

Did you know that someone lives atop Smith Tower? Petra Franklin Lahaie holds the lease. She cleared the space after a water tower was removed, converted it into an apartment, and made her home there with her family and her massive Chihuly chandelier.

        <div class="content">
          The humble writing prompt is such a great device. When you&rsquo;re stuck, as a writer, often times the perception is that there aren&rsquo;t any ideas, and that the world is bereft of good plots.
Given the idiosyncrasies of human thinking, what&rsquo;s maybe going on is that you are stuck in your own loops. Prompts, from the brain/emotion loops of other humans, can be helpful to spark an idea. Other&rsquo;s ideas surprise you, like the punchline to a good joke, and in that surprise comes a stepping out of yourself into another possible imagination.

Dear Cienna,
I just got dumped. I need some inspiration — what’s the greatest love story you’ve ever read? One friend gave me a book of Leonard Cohen poems and I almost killed myself.

          The final paragraph of this Seattle Times story about layoffs at KOMO by Rachel Lerman really hammers home how absolutely screwed the Seattle media scene is these days:  NBC News shut down its Seattle-based Breaking News startup, and [The *Seattle Globalist*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/12/15/sarah-glidden-gets-animated-for-the-seattle-globalist/), a nonprofit news site, is working to raise money from subscribers after the University of Washington announced it would no longer fund the site. Northwest Cable News is scheduled to go dark at the end of this week.
