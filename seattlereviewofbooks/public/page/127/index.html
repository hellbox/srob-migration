Using the word-mashing logic of SeaTac, we should have named the lake to our east SeaBelle. To the North, perhaps we could make a region called SeaEver, and perhaps our ferry runs could be SeaBain, SeaVash, and SeaBrem.

        <div class="content">
          Charlie Warzel at BuzzFeed:
As Amazon positions itself as an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, inside the company, dozens of employees are voicing deep concern about another political issue: Amazon’s choice to advertise on Breitbart.com.
According to internal emails and documents obtained by BuzzFeed News, employees have begun voicing concerns about the company’s advertising relationship with the provocative far-right website. Some piled on to a complaint ticket in Amazon’s internal issue escalation system urging the company to sever its relationship with Breitbart, the site that former editor and now–Senior White House Advisor Steve Bannon once called “the platform for the alt-right.

        <div class="content">
          &ldquo;I dreamed that my passport was a book of prayers,&rdquo; Sherman Alexie writes in his new poem &ldquo;Autopsy&rdquo; at Early Bird Books. &ldquo;Autopsy&rdquo; is a deeply political poem that was born from this political moment, like Elisa Chavez&rsquo;s &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; and Claudia Castro Luna&rsquo;s &ldquo;Am I not an immigrant?,&rdquo; both of which were published right here on the Seattle Review of Books. It is incredibly heartening to see poets making something out of this despair, and to see the general public respond to these poems with such enthusiasm.

Dear Cienna,
I kind of have a crush on a writer. She’s funny and smart, and her novels are great; they make me think differently about the world.

          I have written about how good the Flintstones comic is, but it has to be noted that the most recent issue, #8, is the best, most ambitious edition yet. It satirizes gender roles, economics, politics, and celebrity, and it also contains a great little story about how the ultimate goal of parenting should be to fuck the next generation up slightly less than your own.
My favorite part of the new issue is when a guest speaker named &ldquo;Thorstone Pebblen&rdquo; discusses &ldquo;a brand-new field of research called &lsquo;economics.

        <div class="content">
          You have to read Mary Ann Gwinn&rsquo;s final column in her role as the Seattle Times books editor. It&rsquo;s a grand and generous tour of the last 34 years in Seattle literary history. I&rsquo;m not going to pull a single quote here, because you should read the whole thing. (Full disclosure: I choked up a little at the shoutout to the Seattle Review of Books.)
But before we get too somber, let&rsquo;s note that Gwinn is not disappearing: she will contribute columns to the Times, she&rsquo;s writing about books for other outlets, and she&rsquo;ll continue to co-host Well Read on KCTS.

          It’s easy to see why Rebecca Solnit’s book Hope in the Dark has become an independent bookstore bestseller in the months since Donald Trump won the election. After all, it’s a book written by one of our smartest cultural critics about finding hope in difficult political times. Readers know they can trust Solnit to not be too Pollyannaish in her conclusions about hope. She’s physically incapable of offering a bromide, or a cliché, or an unsupported premise.
