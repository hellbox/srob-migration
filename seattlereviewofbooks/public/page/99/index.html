          Like so many of the best books, I found it hidden behind a couple outdated computer programming manuals in a Goodwill. It’s a tall, slim hardcover book with a torn dustjacket. The cover is a soulful color sketch of a tiny figure standing on a roof staring out at a cloudy night sky. It says in big letters at the top, The Man, and below that, in smaller print, the author credit: Raymond Briggs.

        <div class="content">
          When I was growing up I believed that history happened elsewhere – Plymouth Rock, the Alamo, the Oregon Trail. I never thought of National City, where I lived, as having a history. Even though we learned in fourth grade that the first Californians were Indians, the implication we received was that they had vanished with the progress of “civilization.”
Several years ago, my sister sent me a book called Early National City issued by Arcadia Publishing, the “leading local history publisher in the United States.

**Wednesday April 12th: * Krazy* Reading**
George Herriman was America’s very first cartooning genius. His strip Krazy Kat depicted more than just a love triangle between a cat, a brick-throwing mouse, and a canine police officer — it laid out the cartooning language that we still see in modern comics. Michael Tisserand’s biography of Herriman finally gives the genius his due. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, elliottbaybook.

          In July of 2015 on the website Very Smart Brothas, Damon Young wrote a blog post titled “Serena Williams Drinks, Bathes In, and Makes Lemonade with White Tears.” The next day, he published a post titled “White Tears, Explained, for White People Who Don’t Get It.” It seems that his original post about Serena Williams inspiring white tears had inspired some white tears of its own. Young quoted a white reader’s response to his article: “It’s disturbing how it seems many black people resent white people, when we all bleed the same color.
