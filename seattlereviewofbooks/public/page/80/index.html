Last Tuesday, the Seattle area’s newest bookstore opened its doors. Located in Redmond Town Center, [Brick & Mortar Books](https://www.brickandmortarbooks.com/) is a general-interest new bookstore that will carry up to 30,000 titles when its shelves are full. For the next month, Brick & Mortar will be in soft-opening mode as its team of booksellers learn the ins and outs of bookselling and meet their community. On the weekend of June 23rd and 24th, the store will host its official grand opening weekend.

          The (fabulously named) Robert A. Cronkleton at the Kansas City Star wrote at the beginning of May:
Passengers at Kansas City International Airport say they recently have been asked to remove all paper products from their carry-ons while going through security screening checkpoints.
That includes all books, loose-leaf paper, Post-It notes and files. They’ve been told by screeners that the new procedures are part of a pilot program that is being rolled out nationwide.

Dear Cienna,
My husband and I are divorcing. It’s not a bad divorce, so far as these things go. Relatively amicable.
But how should we determine who gets custody of the books without having a lawyer itemize the entirety of our bookshelves?

**Tuesday June 6th: *Life’s Work* Reading**
Shout Your Abortion is presenting Dr. Willie Parker at a special Town Hall event this coming Tuesday, and attendance is required for anyone who thinks a woman’s right to choose is essential for the future of this country. At this special event to celebrate the publication of *Life’s Work*, Parker will be introduced by Seattle celebrity Lindy West, who helped Amelia Bonow get SYA off the ground, and Parker will be interviewed by staunch SYA ally Martha Plimpton, who appeared most recently as the mom in the sitcom *The Real O’Neals*.
