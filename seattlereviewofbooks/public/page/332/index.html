          The Darkness Before the Right Park MacDougald in a long piece examining a particualrly American conservatism that&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s coined, neoreactionism:
 As the twenty-first century gets darker, politics are likely to follow suit, and for all its apparent weirdness, neoreaction may be an early warning system for what a future anti-democratic right looks like. So what is neoreaction, then, exactly? For all the talk of neo-feudalism and geeks for monarchy, it’s less a single ideology than a loose constellation of far-right thought, clustered around three pillars: religious traditionalism, white nationalism, and techno-commercialism (the names are self-explanatory).

        <div class="content">
          Early in the darkness of Christmas Eve, on top of Capitol Hill, over by Volunteer Park in the old section where the mansions loom, four young women stood on an unlit porch, pressed against the door, their backs turned to a driving downpour.
In the front of the group Imani struggled with her keys, going through a few before finding the one that took purchase. A shriek cut the air, the hinges of the door complaining from uncommon use.

        <div class="content">
          One of my favorite Christmas traditions is ghost stories. A Christmas Carol comes to mind first, of course. It has its own delights, to be sure — especially in reading, as opposed to the many dramatic renditions which have rendered it more toothless and hackneyed than it deserves. The story still has some spook and humor left in it, thanks to Dickens&rsquo; steady lyrical hand. Look how he described just how despicable Scrooge is:

          “It’s a Christmas un-miracle,” Nick at Phoenix Comics announced yesterday as I stared down the empty wall of new releases. Turns out, the Grinch stole New Comics Day this week: the heavy snowfall at Snoqualmie Pass meant that the Diamond Distribution truck carrying all the new comics intended to arrive in Seattle today was stuck on the east side of the mountains. No comics store in the entire Seattle area received any new comics yesterday.

&mdash; Meytal Radzinski (@Biblibio) December 18, 2015 We already know that women don&rsquo;t win very many awards in literature. Read Radzinski&rsquo;s timeline to get a sense of how hard it is for women to even get published in English.

          &ldquo;These are dark days in the United States,&rdquo; Seattle writer Lesley Hazleton said at an event called “Love in a Time of Fear: Muslims and Christians as Good Neighbors&rdquo; in Lynnwood. Her talk is nine minutes long, and it&rsquo;s incredible. Please watch it:

        <div class="content">
          Did you know that Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, is a real dillhole? It&rsquo;s true! And the Tumblr MRA Dilbert performs a real public service by publishing Scott Adams&rsquo;s actual words in the word balloons of his characters. This is such a clever way to comment on Adams&rsquo; toxic beliefs. Contrasting them with the bland inoccuousness of his cartoons — although calling Adams&rsquo;s drawing &ldquo;cartoons&rdquo; feels like an insult to cartooning — lays all the ugliness of his ideas and work out for anyone to see.
