          Maybe I was just in a bad mood or something, but I didn&rsquo;t find much enjoyment in the comics I bought yesterday. The new issue of Godzilla in Hell is a total bust — a real downer of a serious, clunky monster comic after last issue’s greatness. The 28th issue of Astro City continues a depressing trend with that series; what began as commentary on superheroes has basically become a boring superhero anthology comic.

          The Seattle edition of Lit Crawl is finally here! It starts at 6 pm and continues through 8:45 (although the afterparty at Fred Wildlife Refuge will likely continue until the booze runs dry.) You can find a map and schedule here.
If you need help choosing what to do tonight, here are all eight of the itineraries we&rsquo;ve proposed here at the Seattle Review of Books over the last week-and-a-half:

          On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our final suggested itinerary:
Today we&rsquo;re focusing on some Lit Crawl events featuring excellent local writers you really ought to know by now.

          Johanna Sinisalo, fondly known as the queen of Finnish Weird, is coming to Seattle, and will be appearing at the Elliott Bay Book Company on October 24th, and I&rsquo;m quite excited about it. I live in Seattle. Elliott Bay is my neighborhood bookstore. I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Sinisalo&rsquo;s work for years. And I&rsquo;ve been asked to serve as a sort of host, because I translated her two most recent novels into English.

          Over 14,000 people recently took a Seattle Public Library survey about a &ldquo;branding initiative&rdquo; that would change the face of the library and cost well over a million dollars, according to SPL Communications Director Andra Addison. Advised by heavy-hitter Hornall Anderson, City Librarian Marcellus Turner is spearheading a campaign to rename the library and replace its familiar logo, all in an effort to more clearly project the image described in this &ldquo;brand statement&rdquo;:

          Our October Bookstore of the Month is a special one, because it’s a bookstore that will only exist in the world for one day. [The Short Run Comix & Arts Festival](http://www.shortrun.org/) will take place this year on October 31st at Fisher Pavilion in the Seattle Center, and for that one day, it will be the largest bookseller of independent literature, zines, and comics in the Seattle area. Every week this month, we’ll highlight a different Short Run exhibitor, to give you a better idea of the scope and breadth of the festival.

          Every October 20th a coalition of partners like the New York Times, the National Writing Project, the National Council of Teachers of English, and the Teaching Channel come together to encourage writing. They want you to hashtag: #WhyIWrite.
I even did one of my own:
#WhyIWrite Because figuring out how I feel about something requires five or so years and 80,000 or so words.
&mdash; Martin McClellan (@hellbox) October 20, 2015 The whole thing was inspired by Orwell’s famous essay, whose title inspired the hashtag.

All of the readings on this itinerary feature true, honest-to-God, not-made-up stories.
1. At Town Hall to start out the night, memoirists Sarah Hepola (Blackout) and Melissa Febos (Whip Smart) will read from their stories of sobriety and recovery.

        <div class="content">
          The title novella in Colum McCann’s new collection Thirteen Ways of Looking is a mystery, but it’s less of a whodunnit and more of a how’d-it-happen. Our protagonist, a former New York state Supreme Court judge named Peter Mendelssohn, is elderly and infirm. His wife, Eileen, has died. His son, Elliot, is a disappointment. Mendelssohn spends all morning in bed, thinking of the life he lived. He’s not overcome with regret, although he desperately hates the adult diaper that his nurse, an immigrant named Sally, makes him wear.
