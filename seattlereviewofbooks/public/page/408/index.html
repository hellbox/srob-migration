          Matthew Simmons, the local author and publisher of Instant Future, an e-novella imprint of Future Tense Press, has figured out a way to re-enact an American short story classic in Grand Theft Auto:
How to play Cheever&#39;s The Swimmer in GTA V: Take Michael to Vinewood Hills, get him a star &amp; have him escape by running from pool to pool.
&mdash; Matthew Simmons (@matthewjsimmons) August 5, 2015 I don&#39;t just make this stuff up.

        <div class="content">
          Usually, this column is about new comics I bought on Wednesday. But last night I went to a press screening for the Fantastic Four movie that opens tomorrow, and I want to talk about that for a bit instead. (If you&rsquo;re looking for a straight-up movie review, you can read my review at Prairie Dog.)
The first 102 issues of the Fantastic Four by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee are basically the template for every adventure comic book that came after: big sci-fi ideas, big discoveries, comic relief, and personal drama.

        <div class="content">
          KING 5&rsquo;s New Day NW interviewed local writers Anca Szilagyi and Erin Malone about the very worthy Jack Straw Writers Program. (I&rsquo;d embed the video here, but in my experience KING 5&rsquo;s video viewer tends to make websites shiver, roll over, and die. You&rsquo;re better off just clicking through and viewing it on their own site.) The interview also discusses Hugo House, and it promotes a Jack Straw reading that happens tonight at Elliott Bay Book Company.

          You may have noticed that we do things a little differently around here. We don&rsquo;t have ads like most websites. Instead of irrelevant, slow, bloated, and often weirdly offensive ads on the site, we have sponsorships. Instead of repeated images of that one product you looked at once that follows you around the internet like a ghost, or scammy computer fix-it ads that have nothing to do with books, we&rsquo;re offering you something that we know you love: reading.

        <div class="content">
          This New York Times obituary for the Cold War historian makes him so easy to like. Conquest was a poet and a fan of science fiction, and he once responded to liberal criticism with a historical limerick:
There was a great Marxist called Lenin
Who did two or three million men in.
That’s a lot to have done in,
But where he did one in
That grand Marxist Stalin did ten in.

(*Every four weeks, the* Seattle Review of Books *will feature one area bookseller as our Bookstore of the Month. We’ll run weekly features highlighting some of the qualities that make the store so unique — the staff, the stock, the events — as a celebration of bookselling culture. Our first Bookstore of the Month is especially near and dear to our hearts because they also agreed to serve as* Seattle Review of Books’s *mailing address, for which we are eternally grateful.

          You may have noticed that we published a wonderful poem by Kelli Russell Agodon this morning. It&rsquo;s the debut of a new SRoB feature: every Tuesday, we&rsquo;ll present a poem by a local poet.
Here&rsquo;s the way it works: we reach out to a poet and ask for a selection of poems to look over. We work with the poet to select the poem that&rsquo;s right for SRoB. We then publish the poem and pay the poet for their work.
