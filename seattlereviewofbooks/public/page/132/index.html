          We’ve been trained by popular culture to visualize serial killers in a very specific way: they’re sleek, efficient, charming hunters of humans. Sociopathic and hyper-intelligent, serial killers are always five steps ahead of everyone else. They’re willful, clever, highly manipulative loners, and they’re relentlessly driven by some lone traumatic incident in their childhood. They’re not so much human beings as puzzle-boxes to entertain and alarm us for a couple hours until they’re finally captured and the closing credits roll.

Texas representative Bill Flores, chair of the Republican Study Committee, has released a Blueprint for a Balanced Budget 2.0 (PDF) that lays out a Republican plan for austerity under the guise of fiscal responsibility. It&rsquo;s a horrifying document, one that leaves the American people on their own while sustaining enormous military expenditures that amount to, by far, the largest defense budget on earth. So what gets cut? Programs that assist the poor, regulatory committes, and healthy school lunches (&ldquo;funding for the National School Lunch Program standards should be prohibited, returning control of students’ diets to their parents.

          Velociraptors and I have faces for the movies.
We have learned how to open doors: We scrape talons

leave fading indent in the bed. He calls asking where I am.
I’m in your blind spot.
I’m watching heat radiate off you
as you stumble through the woods. I am attracted
to movement, meaning I only chase something when it runs.
Like a velociraptor, I will not text you back.

          Carolyn Reidy, the CEO at Simon &amp; Schuster, released a letter in response to the uproar that followed the news that a conservative imprint of S&amp;S was publishing a book by white nationalist Milo Yiannopoulos. The response (published below) is several weeks too late and it doesn&rsquo;t actually address the issues that many have raised about the deal.
Reidy assures readers that the book will not feature hate speech. This is, of course, beside the point.

_The Seattle Review of Books_ has donated our sponsorship slot this week to encourage our readers to donate to the [ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/secure/become-freedom-fighter-join-aclu?s_src=UNW170001C00&alt_src=UNV170001C00&ms=web_menu_join). Just the few first days of the Trump administration were enough to tell us that we're going to need as many hands on deck as possible to fight him.
That means lawsuits, and challenging him in court. That means the ACLU is going to be vital to American freedom in the years to come.

        <div class="content">
          Elisa Chavez’s poem [“Revenge”](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/01/03/revenge/) was published on her Tumblr and then was republished by Seattle author Lesley Hazleton. We [read the poem on Hazleton’s blog](http://accidentaltheologist.com/?p=6059) and got permission from both Chavez and Hazleton to publish it on the *Seattle Review of Books*, and we made Chavez our very first Poet in Residence for the month of January. Then, the poem went absolutely nuts: this month, many tens of thousands of people have come to the *Seattle Review of Books* to read and share “Revenge” with their social networks.
