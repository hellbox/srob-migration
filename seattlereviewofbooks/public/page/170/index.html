          Sponsor Ronna Wineberg generously gave us permission to run an entire short story from her book Nine Facts That Can Change Your Life for her sponsorship this week. The story, &ldquo;Bare Essentials&rdquo;, appears in full on our sponsor&rsquo;s page.
The book received great marks in Kirkus and the Village Voice, but it&rsquo;s what you think that matters most, which is why a full story is such a treat. Be sure to indulge yourself, and if you like it, click through to pick up the book.

          Michael Schaub at the L.A. Times writes:
Lucia Perillo, a poet known for her sense of humor and her writing about living with multiple sclerosis, died on Oct. 16 at the age of 58 in Olympia, Wash., her publisher Copper Canyon Press confirms. Her most recent book, “Time Will Clean the Carcass Bones,” was published in February. Perillo was a MacArthur &ldquo;Genius&rdquo; Fellowship winner, her work was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize, and she was no stranger to the Seattle literary scene.

        <div class="content">
          Time was, you just had to keep your eye on a few New York publications in order to see if there was any new writing from the top authors in the country. Now, thankfully, there are infinitely more outlets available. Case in point: earlier this month, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie published a great essay about the state of feminism on her Facebook page, and it&rsquo;s slowly been making the rounds ever since.

The Twitter feed of Chick Publications is reporting that Jack Chick, the religious cartoonist famous for his pocket-sezed &ldquo;Chick tracts&rdquo;, has died. His comics were incredibly hateful — they insisted that basically anyone who is not straight, white, and Evangelical is a failure of a human being who deserves to burn in hell — but they were also hugely influential.
An army of artoonists, ranging from Dan Clowes to Steve Ellis and Fred Van Lente, have parodied Chick tracts.

        <div class="content">
          One summer day, early in the 21st-century, I’m southbound on Bellevue’s NE 104th, approaching the NE 8th intersection, for generations the city’s main one. It takes me two traffic lights to get through, and as I wait I study the towers just to my left (“Bellevue Place”) and a range of other buildings ahead and to my right. Steel gleams in the diffused light through the usual cloud cover. I’ve ridden through here all my life, and driven it for over three decades, but I recognize nothing, only the slight downward slope as I pass through Kemperville down to Main Street.

          HTMLGiant, the popular literary blog that shut down two years ago, just started publishing again this morning, with seemingly no notice. They&rsquo;re also starting an anonymous advice column.

          As Louis Collins and I discuss his nearly half-century in the book business, it’s impossible for me to not take notice of his goofy blue sweatshirt, which reads “I TOOK THE PLUNGE! SPA HOT SPRINGS MOTEL WHITE SULFUR SPRINGS, MT.” Collins, the owner of our September Bookstore of the Month, Louis Collins Books, comes across as eminently comfortable in his own skin; he seems happy with his lot in life.
