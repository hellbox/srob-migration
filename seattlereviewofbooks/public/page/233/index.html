          This, which we found on poet Kelli Russell Agodon&rsquo;s Twitter feed, is a terrific idea: poet.tips recommends poets to you, in the by-now-ubiquitous internet recommendation format of &ldquo;If you like X, then you&rsquo;ll like Y.&rdquo; The engine stretches from classics&hellip;
 Edna St. Vincent Millay T.S. Eliot Denise Levertov  &hellip;to contemporary greats&hellip;
 Patricia Lockwood Dorothea Lasky Alice Notley Eileen Myles  &hellip;to local favorites:
 Kelli Russell Agodon Sherman Alexie Karen Finneyfrock Maged Zaher  Recommendation engines are not the be-all end-all of discovery, of course, but they can send you on some interesting tangents.

          I was a kindergartener in 1958 when the in loco parentis doctrine, which granted teachers the same rights as parents to punish children in their care, was still common practice. It allowed my mean-eyed teacher with the heavily penciled eyebrows and too-black hair to take it upon herself to line up every child in the classroom and inspect our underwear. Someone had pooped their pants and the hapless offender would not, could not, face the humiliation of such a public admission &mdash; at least not voluntarily.

          There used to be two LGBT-themed bookstores on Capitol Hill alone. Now there are none. Lots of people would say that this is a sign of progress — after all, though we may not have a Beyond the Closet or a Bailey/Coy on Capitol Hill anymore, pretty much every bookstore in town now has a huge section devoted to LGBT issues. Virtually every bookstore I can think of has at least one LGBT employee, and some have many more than one.

          Science fiction has always inspired real-world technological advances. The very first employees of NASA were inspired by the rocket-ship and ray-gun festooned pulp sci-fi of the 1930s and 1940s. Most of the greatest innovators of the last 30 years have found their inspiration in sci-fi novels. Steve Jobs, creepily, recommended 1984 to new hires at Apple. Elon Musk is very public about his love of Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and Douglas Adams.
