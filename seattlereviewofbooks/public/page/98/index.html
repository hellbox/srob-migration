*(Once in a while, I take a new book with me to lunch and give it a half an hour or so to grab my attention. Lunch Date is my judgment on that speed-dating experience.)*
**Who’s your date today?** *Listen, Liberal: Or, What Ever Happened to the Party of the People?* by Thomas Frank. (Frank will be reading at Town Hall tomorrow night.)
**Where’d you go?** The [Tigerly Ox](http://tigerlyox.com/), a newish Vietnamese lunch counter on Madison.

        <div class="content">
          When news broke last month that Joan Swift had died, the Seattle literary community erupted in outpourings of grief. A shared sensation spread quickly around Facebook that something momentous had passed with her. At 90 years old, Swift was well-loved by many generations of Seattle writers, and she provided a direct link to the history of Northwest literature. She was one of the last living writers to learn directly from Seattle poetry godfather Theodore Roethke, and she shepherded generations of writers out of anonymity and into maturity.

          Heidi MacDonald at the Beat says that Sarah Glidden&rsquo;s Rolling Blackouts has won the Penn State University Libraries&rsquo; 2017 Lynd Ward prize. MacDonald says the prize is given to &ldquo;the best graphic novel, fiction or non-fiction, published in the previous calendar year by a living U.S. or Canadian citizen or resident. It’s definitely one of the most prestigious awards for a graphic novel given out each year.&rdquo;
We&rsquo;ve been talking about Sarah Glidden for a long time here on the Seattle Review of Books.

        <div class="content">
          Alec Baldwin reads from his new memoir Nevertheless at the Paramount tonight. It&rsquo;s sold out.
If you&rsquo;re thinking about buying Baldwin&rsquo;s memoir, you should know that Baldwin is openly complaining about the job his editors did on the book. Danuta Kean at The Guardian notes:
The 59-year-old actor has attacked his publisher HarperCollins, accusing the editors of poor proofreading. In his first post on a Facebook page set up to promote his new autobiography, *Nevertheless*, he claimed the published edition “contains SEVERAL typos and errors which I was more than a little surprised to see”.

Dear Cienna,
Everyone calls comics “graphic novels,” but a lot of great comics, like *Persepolis* and *Fun Home*, are non-fiction. So “novel” isn’t right. But some comics aren’t funny at all, and so “comic” books doesn’t make sense, either.
