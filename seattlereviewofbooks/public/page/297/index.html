          The New Web Typography Surely, you can picture them: the Penguin books with the colored covers, the little medalian at the bottom with the line-drawing of the bird logo? That design and layout are the work of the great typographer and designer Jan Tschichold. His most famous book, The New Typography, was a firebrand call from a young designer &mdash; one who later came to disown some of the more radical ideas he earlier held (I wrote about Tschichold, and how he got in trouble with the Nazis, and his relationship with Penguin in this essay).

        <div class="content">
          On the same weekend that Seattle Mystery Bookshop&rsquo;s GoFundMe campaign draws to a close, Wallingford&rsquo;s delightful Wide World Travel &amp; Maps — the oldest travel bookstore in the country — has launched their own GoFundMe campaign. They&rsquo;re looking to raise $30,000, and according to Shelf Awareness, Rick Steves&rsquo; Europe has donated a compelling travel package if the store hits its goals.
As I said when Seattle Mystery Bookshop announced their campaign, if crowd-funding isn’t your thing but you like to support independent bookstores, stop by Wide World Travel &amp; Maps — they’re at 4411 Wallingford Ave N — and pick up a few books to prepare for an upcoming vacation, or a trip that you hope to one day make.

**Dear Cienna,**
**The Little Free Library closest to my house is often full of crap. I&rsquo;m talking outdated programming books and collections of VHS tapes and other things that stay in the LFL for weeks and weeks because no one wants them.

          In 2008, the Seattle International Film Festival hosted the film Battle in Seattle as its opening night gala presentation. Battle, a fictionalized account of the 1999 World Trade Organization protests, had the pedigree of a successful film: it starred Charlize Theron, Outkast’s Andre 3000, Woody Harrelson, Ray Liotta, and Channing Tatum, and it was scored by Massive Attack. At the opening night screening, the room clearly wanted to be on the film&rsquo;s side; Seattle desperately loves to see itself legitimized through adaptation, even if nine times out of ten it’s portrayed onscreen by Vancouver.
