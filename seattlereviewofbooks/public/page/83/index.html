          Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles good for slow consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also look through the archives.
The Beleaguered Tenants of ‘Kushnerville’ Withholding maintenance as a power play, hardcore debt collection, and public shaming for late rent — sounds like a classic slumlord. Or, maybe, Jared Kushner.

          Seattle&rsquo;s Office of Arts &amp; Culture is accepting applications for its CityArtist Projects grant, which provides funds for artists seeking to complete a project. The grant changes disciplines every year, and literary artists are up for consideration this year. You have 55 days left to apply, so get to it.
 Ted Closson&rsquo;s cartoon at The Nib titled &ldquo;A GoFundMe Campaign Is Not Health Insurance&rdquo; is required reading. It seems that every day I see another writer or musician or artist in medical distress whose lives depend on the outcome of a GoFundMe campaign.

          Writer Chris Offutt reports on Twitter:
Yes, it&#39;s true. Denis Johnson died yesterday morning. He was at home, peaceful.
&mdash; Chris Offutt (@Chris_Offutt) May 26, 2017 Based on the high number of mourning authors on my Twitter feed right now, it&rsquo;s fair to characterize Johnson as a writer&rsquo;s writer — one of the greats, a talent so advanced that it mystifies peers.
Jesus&rsquo; Son has to be one of the best short story collections of the 20th century, and The Name of the World is a magnificent short novel about grief and loss and people-shaped holes in lives.

You already know that Robert Lashley is a force of nature. He’s one of the most vibrant readers to come out of the Pacific Northwest. You might not know poet Gary Copeland Lilley, a Cave Canem fellow whose latest book is *The Bushman’s Medicine Show*.

          Every month, Daneet Steffens uncovers the latest goings on in mystery, suspense, and crime fiction. See previous columns on the [Criminal Fiction archive page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/criminal-fiction).
With its friendly staff, shedloads of books, and cool author signings, the Seattle Mystery Bookshop is one of the loveliest jewels in the city’s literary crown. Keep an eye on their event calendar , which showcases the best of mystery writers, local, regional, national and international. On the radar for summer: Cara Black, creator of the astute Parisian PI Aimee Leduc, drops in at noon on Wednesday, June 14, and on July 5, the excellent Jill Dawson, over from England, signs The Crime Writer, her canny fictional melding of Patricia Highsmith, a sleepy Suffolk village, and a spot of murder.

It&rsquo;s a kind of nerdception: Rise of the Dungeon Master is a biography of Gary Gygax, inventor of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, told in comic book form. Writer David Kushner and artist Koren Shadmi do excellent work transforming what could be an incredibly dry subject — Gygax&rsquo;s slow construction of Dungeons &amp; Dragons from pieces of miniatures-based military reenactment games — into a breezy biographical story. Rise is a book that shouldn&rsquo;t work, for several important reasons.

          Not only has William Gibson proven to be the living sci-fi novelist who is best at predicting the future, he is also an absolute joy to follow on Twitter. And when Gibson is not retweeting current events that sound like he invented them 25 years ago, he is complaining that the future is moving too damn fast:
Ridiculous contemporary shit that makes my job harder. Thanks, Singapore https://t.co/OAFfUeLIAk
