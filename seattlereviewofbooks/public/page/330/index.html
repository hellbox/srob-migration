 But the discussion reflects a broader truth: We live in an age in which machine intelligence has become a part of daily life. Computers fly planes and soon will drive cars. Computer algorithms anticipate our needs and decide which advertisements to show us.

          Every day, friend of the SRoB Rahawa Haile tweets a short story. She gave us permission to collect them every week. She's archiving the entire project on Storify. This is the last wrap-up, since the project is now over. We'd like to offer Rahawa a hearty congratulations on a big project nicely executed. We'll miss seeing the stories every day, but still have many to comb through, and even some to read again.

        <div class="content">
          After Thanksgiving, New Years Day is my favorite holiday. Unlike the gifts of Christmas or the costumes of Halloween, New Year’s Day brings with it no obligations. You’re just supposed to relax, and not work, and think about the year that just ended and the year that just began. If you’re hungover, maybe the day is about regret. If you’ve made a series of resolutions, maybe it’s about hope. But it’s a day that is profoundly uninterested in itself.

        <div class="content">
          Seattle cartoonist Tom Van Deusen’s newest book, EAT EAT EAT, is the latest entry in a long comics tradition: a humorous book about a feckless loser who doesn’t possess the self-awareness to realize that he is a feckless loser. It’s a somewhat proud (if self-loathing) lineage, stretching to Chris Ware and Ivan Brunetti from R. Crumb and Dan Clowes and on and on and on.
&lt; EAT EAT EAT is the story of a feckless loser named Tom Van Deusen (the indicia informs us that the book “is a work of pure fiction.

          Even the most complimentary reviews of Star Wars: The Force Awakens mention that the movie is for all intents and purposes a remake of Star Wars: A New Hope. Critics who loved the film tended to refer to the fact that it’s a remake as an aside; critics who disliked the film based their entire reviews around it. This is not automatically a strike against Force so much as a reality of moviemaking today.

          A quick reminder: you can still sign up for the 6-week book reviewing class that Martin McClellan and I are teaching at Hugo House. We intend to discuss the purpose of book reviews, what it takes to make a book review into something more than just a GoodReads blurb or a boring plot synopsis, and the many different forms a book review can take. We&rsquo;re also going to get into some very important ideas: why responding to art is necessary, how to become a better reader, and why books are so important.

          Galleycat says:
Adolf Hitler’s anti-Semitic manifesto *Mein Kampf* has been banned from Germany for 70 years, but will return to German bookstores next month. So many factors are at play here — atrocity, history, copyright, the free exchange of ideas — that really all we can do is wait and watch what happens. Will German bookstores carry Mein Kampf? Will people buy it? What happens when the most hateful, reviled, and influential book in the history of a nation becomes readily available again?
