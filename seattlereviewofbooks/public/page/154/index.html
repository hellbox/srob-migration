          Cienna Madrid is taking the day off to relax, and recharge, and maybe do some karaoke. Her column will return next week. As always, if you have any writing, reading, or bookstore etiquette questions, please send them to her at advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.
And in the meantime, I have some advice for you. I&rsquo;m not a professional advice-giver like Cienna, but here&rsquo;s my best shot:
 If you&rsquo;re working on your NaNoWriMo novel this weekend and you&rsquo;re having trouble getting through the home stretch, give your protagonist amnesia.

          Once, over drinks, a friend leaned in so close I could smell the clove cigarettes on her breath, and then she told me the truth. “Living in Seattle,” she said, “is like being madly in love with a beautiful woman who’s sick all the time.”
This was probably fifteen years ago, but it’s one of those moments that juts into the gears of your mind and blows the whole mechanism to pieces.

          We got an email from Secret Garden Bookshop&rsquo;s Suzanne Perry explaining the Ballard bookshop&rsquo;s Christmas gift program, and it sounds like a damn good cause:
Through the holiday season, 120 green angels displayed around our shop represent children's names, ages, and their heart's desire in the form of a new book. They've been collected by our friend [Michele Bacon](http://www.michelebacon.com), who, for the third year running, has worked in close association with three local schools: Whitman Middle School, Salmon Bay, and BF Day.

          Every month, Daneet Steffens uncovers the latest goings on in mystery, suspense, and crime fiction. See previous columns on the [Criminal Fiction archive page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/criminal-fiction)
Over the past couple of weeks, it’s been a real pleasure to while away several hours in the podcast-presence of Two Crime Writers and a Microphone. UK crime fiction scribes Steve Cavanagh and Luca Veste deliver silly laughs &mdash; how about those ducks? &mdash; as well as more practical pearls of wisdom, chatting about publishing news (and some non-publishing news, too), hosting book reviewers, and interviewing fellow crime fiction writers like Ian Rankin, Stuart Neville &mdash; who contributes the podcast’s twangy-groovy interstitial music &mdash; CL Taylor, Craig Robertson, Mark Billingham, and Ruth Ware.

For decades, American retail employees called the day after Thanksgiving “Black Friday,” but they did so in the stockrooms and break rooms of their stores, away from customers. Managers used the term because Thanksgiving weekend sales are what typically drive a store’s yearly profits into the black. Ground-level employees called the day “Black Friday” because it was so brutal it could kill you.
At some point, “Black Friday entered the popular vernacular as the name of an official shopping holiday, and that was when holiday shopping started to get really out of hand; without “Black Friday” as a popular concept, you don’t get Target employees who have to leave their family’s Thanksgiving dinners early so they can open the store for a bunch of ungrateful yahoos who will happily murder their neighbors to get their hands on a deeply discounted flat screen TV.
