          On Facebook, the founder of Seattle-area feminist magazine Stackedd, Ma’chell Duma Lavassar, made an exciting announcement: with the help of the good folks at Shunpike, Stackedd has become a nonprofit:
Beginning in January we will become an organization focused on what we do best &mdash; promoting women and non-binary folks in the fields of Art and Media. The Magazine will publish online bi-weekly and in print three times a year. In addition, we'll be teaching workshops, presenting forums and continuing and expanding our youth programs.

        <div class="content">
          There’s been a lot of talk about the balcony railing lately. Is it up to code? Does it have a soul? What secrets does it hold? Does it have reality? Does it have anyone to blame but itself? What are we to do with it? Why does it have to appear at all? Personally, I don’t really care. It’s not our balcony. But as an external feature of the building we are to share in its fate and responsibility.

          Sponsor Barbara E Geary is here to introduce you to her book I Can Speak Medical!, a light and fun introduction to medical terms and speak. Geary was a professional registered nurse, and taught an Introduction to Medical Vocabulary class. She brings that expertise to her great book.
You can read her introduction on our sponsor&rsquo;s page. You&rsquo;ll find the book a great resource &mdash; yes, for people entering the medical profession, but also for the layperson who may be encountering the world of medical language and wanting to understand more.

          Colson Whitehead never writes the same book twice. This is possibly why, despite the fact that he’s been the most consistently excellent novelist to be published by a mainstream New York house over the last two decades, he hasn’t been able to build the audience that he deserves. In these times of fractured fandoms and increasingly algorithm-centric recommendations, people who enjoy Whitehead’s personal, semiautobiographical novel might not even bother to try his zombie novel, and fans of his zombie novel might not think his gigantic examination of the American myth of John Henry is for them.

          On my second visit to Lion Heart Book Store, I overheard David entertaining a small audience with a story involving a large caterpillar on an expensive rug. Like with many customers, he remembered me and greeted me by name. Lion Heart Book Store is full of stories, but not only from David’s life and the books that surround him. Visitors seem eager to share their own stories: they tell him about their book collections, their jobs, their favorite novels, their pipe dreams.

          Hello Sunday Post readers! Thanks to our intern Rebecca Garcia Moreno for handling your picks of Sunday reads over the Summer. She did a great job. Back now to your regularly scheduled recommenations&hellip;.
Framed: she was the pta mom everyone knew. who would want to harm her? Christopher Goffard&rsquo;s absolutely bonkers, and incredible, six-part story from the LA Times, reproduced here in full, about people who do shitty things.
 They were outside Plaza Vista School in Irvine, where she had watched her daughter go from kindergarten to fifth grade, where any minute now the girl would be getting out of class to look for her.
