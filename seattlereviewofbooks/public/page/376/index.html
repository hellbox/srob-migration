          1. David Sedaris will be reading at Benaroya Hall on Sunday, November 15th, 2015. I&rsquo;ll be introducing him, as I&rsquo;ve done at every one of his annual Benaroya Hall appearances for the better part of a decade. The best part of introducing David Sedaris is that when you&rsquo;re done introducing him, you get to watch David Sedaris read. He&rsquo;s simply one of the funniest, best readers in the world. Tickets for this performance are very nearly sold out.

        <div class="content">
          On her blog, cartoonist Julia Wertz describes her interactions with a male fan that are pretty much textbook harassment. He ordered a book of Wertz&rsquo;s cartoons and included the instruction &ldquo;I’d be enchanted if you rubbed your vagina on it.” Wertz refunded his money and refused the order, which then made the fan mad. He insisted that he wasn&rsquo;t harassing her — after all, he says, he framed the instruction as something that he almost wrote in an e-mail to her, it wasn&rsquo;t a real instruction.

          You are the North and I am the South.
My tanks aim for you. I shoot you a thousand times.
Your missiles launch into my oceans. You raise monuments to scorn me.
You eat clams cooked in gasoline.
I drink milk and cider. I raise skyscrapers of businessmen.
You build towers of empty rooms. You refuse me from where I am most loved.
I clean a wintermelon of its guts and seeds cling to my wet fingers.

        <div class="content">
          Dee Lockett at Vulture says:
Ten years after Edward Cullen and Bella Swan made vampires virtually inescapable, Stephenie Meyer is back to turn your tweens once again. In celebration of the first book's anniversary, Meyer has rewritten *Twilight* with the genders of the saga's star-crossed lovers reversed. Meet Beau and Edythe, main characters of the newly feminist reading of the series now dubbed *Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined*, out today. In this version, Bella is Beau, a teen boy who moves to Forks, Washington, and finds himself enamored with the vampire Edythe, the female version of Edward.

          This has already appeared on the Seattle Review of Books, but it&rsquo;s making the rounds again.

          1. Saturday, October 3rd was 24-Hour Comics day, in which cartoonists write and draw a full comic book in a single day. Local cartoonist Henry Chamberlain just posted his 24-hour comic, which stars the Fremont Troll, at the Comics Grinder.
2. Over at Okey Panky, Isaac Cates contributes a handful of comic strips based on a comics game of his own invention: select two comics panels from a deck of previously-created panels.

          MONDAY Your week begins with a weird, wonderful mashup of fiction and poetry at University Book Store, where poet Dennis Milam Bensie reads from his book Flit.The description for the event begins “Used twenty-one times in The Catcher in the Rye, the word &ldquo;flit&rdquo; was introduced by J.D. Salinger as a term for a homosexual man in 1951.” This book mashes up Salinger’s classic and 40 other works of fiction that use homophobic slurs to create a new narrative.

          [Writing Better Trans Characters](http://www.strangehorizons.com/2015/20150928/1morgan-a.shtml) Cheryl Morgan offers guidance on writing trans characters on Strange Horizons. Her audience here is SF writers, but nothing in her advice should be limited to that genre. Any writer could benefit from this read.
 I reject the idea that trans characters should only be written by trans people because cis folk are bound to get it wrong. While there are some really fine trans writers, there simply aren't enough of us in the world to do what is needed.
