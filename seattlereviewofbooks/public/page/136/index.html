        <div class="content">
          Janet I. Tu of the Seattle Times reports that the Bellevue branch of University Book Store will be closing in the middle of next month.
About 20 employees will be affected. They are eligible to apply for positions at University Book Store’s six other locations. Those stores, including ones in Seattle’s University District, Mill Creek and Tacoma, will remain open. Tu quotes University Book Store CEO Louise Little as saying the space, which UBS owns, is “larger than we need,&rdquo; and that UBS &ldquo;is looking for a smaller space on the Eastside.

Wednesday January 11th: Cat Rambo and Margaret Chiavetta
Two Seattle-based fantasy authors debut new work at Seattle’s best sci-fi bookstore. If you’ve been involved in our sci-fi community, you likely know Rambo’s name. Her newest book, Neither Here Nor There, is a collection of fantasy stories. You can see a tiny version of the nifty flip-cover format of the book right above this calendar entry. Chiavetta’s Sir Duffy’s Promise is the first in a new middle-reader fantasy series University Book Store, 4326 University Way N.

          “Provocative” has become a dirty word. As Donald Trump lurches toward the presidency and white nationalist Milo Yiannopoulos scores a $250,000 book deal, provocation has become synonymous with trolling, and trolling has gone mainstream. When Seattle authors Lindy West and Sherman Alexie very visibly quit Twitter last week, they demonstrated an exhaustion with provocation. We’ve had it with devil’s advocates and thought experiments that are intended to do nothing but get a reaction out of us.

          When a young man named Gary Groth established a magazine to address comics as a serious literary art form, he encountered one small problem: at the time — in the mid-1970s — there were no comics worthy of his criticism. So Groth decided to publish the books that he wanted to write about in his magazine. That was the beginning of Fantagraphics Books, the self-described “publisher of the world’s greatest cartoonists.

          I hope you&rsquo;ll keep a couple of events in mind as we approach President Trump&rsquo;s inauguration. At Town Hall on Sunday, January 15th, Washington writers celebrate Martin Luther King Jr&rsquo;s birthday and celebrate free speech with an event called &ldquo;Writers Resist.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll read their own work and the work of great Americans like Susan B. Anthony, Malcolm X, Susan Sontag, and Thomas Paine. Some of the authors reading include:

Snooze-button darling,
I’ve been up all night:
scrubbing the pans till they star-shine,
making the mirror a gleaming lake.
When I come to you
you don’t wake.
Atalanta and Hippomenes
I have a meat-eater’s heart,

You’re ribs slick with smearing sauce,
midnight ice cream
too tempting not to eat &mdash;
you sugared cheat.
You thump between my teeth.

          On Saturday, Heidi Groover at The Stranger reported that Seattle Times book section editor Mary Ann Gwinn was accepting a buyout and leaving the paper. Gwinn is one of nearly two dozen reporters who are being laid off or bought out.
There will be plenty of time to reflect on Gwinn&rsquo;s career in the weeks ahead; she confirmed that she&rsquo;ll sit for an interview with the Seattle Review of Books to discuss her nearly two decades as books editor at the Times.
