        <div class="content">
          KUOW has the news that our state&rsquo;s poet laureate for the next two years will be Tod Marshall, a professor at Spokane&rsquo;s Gonzaga University. You can find an audio sample of Marshall&rsquo;s work on KUOW&rsquo;s site. You can also find more samples of Marshall&rsquo;s work at the ever-indispensible Poetry Foundation. &ldquo;Describe Turner to MLK&rdquo; combines a harrowing eye injury with race and history in a way that I&rsquo;m not sure is entirely successful, but it is certainly ambitious.

          Paul Tobin and Alberto J. Alburquerque’s comic Mystery Girl, now on its second issue, is an absolute delight so far. Here’s the little blurb at the beginning of each book that explains the premise:
Trine Hampstead knows everything. No mystery is too small or too weird for London’s premier sidewalk detective — and she truly knows it all, from your most personal secrets to the details of the deepest, most incredible conspiracies.

        <div class="content">
          A couple months ago, the APRIL Festival announced a writing contest, with the winner receiving $100, the publication of their piece right here on the Seattle Review of Books, and a reading slot in the 2016 festival.
Today, APRIL announced that the winner of their contest is Jessica Mooney, who you can follow on Twitter right now. SRoB cofounder Martin McClellan and I chose the winning entry, and it took a lot of deliberation.

          Brian Tashman at Right Wing Watch says:
In a meeting with *The Des Moines Register*’s editorial board today, Ben Carson defended his proposal to crack down on political bias on college campuses by saying that the Department of Education should have the power to **secretly monitor classrooms and libraries** to root out and uncover potential bias. I&rsquo;ll just come out and say this: if you believe the government should be spying on libraries and classrooms and other places where books and reading are sacrosanct, you are an enemy of America.

          Since our launch week, we've been wrapping up Rahawa Haile's Short Story of the Day project every Saturday. Now that the project is ended, she was nice enough to sit down with us and talk about it. Look for a new thing for us, coming this Saturday.
You’ve been working on this a year now.
-ish, yeah.
When did you start, exactly?
I started January 1st.  So you did start January 1st, so it’s *almost* a full year.

          This, from the Office of Arts and Culture, is pretty damn cool:
The Seattle Office of Arts & Culture,(ARTS) in partnership with Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) seeks a practicing, published poet, fiction, or creative non-fiction writer for a unique project-based **artist residency in the northwest tower of the Fremont Bridge**. The selected writer will undertake an in-depth exploration of the bridge and write a piece in response to the experience.
