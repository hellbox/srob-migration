        <div class="content">
          Let’s lay it out as simply as possible: Marian Engel’s Bear is a novel about a woman who has an erotic relationship with a bear. As you can imagine, this is the sort of premise that probably makes book cover artists lick their lips with anticipation.
![](/webhook-uploads/1452487751509/PaperbackCoverofBearbyMarianEngel.jpg)
To the left of this paragraph, you’ll see the 1976 book cover for the paperback release of Bear. It is, as promotional materials for a newer edition of the book claim, “Heavy Metal-inspired,&rdquo; which is to say that it is lurid and shocking and fun, and also aimed directly at the adolescent male gaze.

          You are not a machine, but a mechanic
tooling out from under skin. And in
my head, you might take flight, alight
with chandeliers of sand. A man said
one is the loneliest number, but this
doesn’t square. I swore I’d shaken
you out, but my hair parted, and there
you were. Part of me, do you smart
with the sting of the repressed? I’m blessed,
but some day you’ll depart, a fingerwave

          Saturday, Spokane author Jess Walter quietly dropped a bomb on Twitter. He was asked about the podcast that he and Sherman Alexie started, A Tiny Sense of Accomplishment, which has not released any new episodes since October of 2015:
Thank you @di3hard ... Not sure about the podcast. Had to get back to our day jobs.

        <div class="content">
          A singular talent, a life-saving artist who constructed a brilliant career, and a passionate reader: to call David Bowie one-in-a-million would be to seriously devalue his uniqueness. Maybe he was one-in-a-species, but he made us all feel like we could be better people. There&rsquo;s not a single dud on his top-100 book list, which was found and shared this morning by Lincoln Michel at Electric Literature. Also, the Seattle Public Library has put together a list of Bowie-related books for you.

        <div class="content">
          MONDAY Your week of civic activism, Black Lives Matter, and a heavy dose of poetry begins at the Fremont branch of the Seattle Public Library with Floating Bridge Press&rsquo;s quarterly reading series An Evening of Poetry. This is Elizabeth Austen’s last Seattle-area appearance in her capacity as Washington’s poet laureate. (Read about our new poet laureate here.) Go and show her some love for all the hard work she’s put in as the public face of poetry.
