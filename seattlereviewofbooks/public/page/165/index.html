          It’s an overwhelming year. We’re all overwhelmed by the presidential election, we’ve been overwhelmed by the continual cycle of cool celebrities dying and the swarm of overwrought tributes to said deceased cool celebrities that flood our social media feeds, and Seattle’s incredible growth — and attendant anxieties — has been impossibly overwhelming all year long. In fact, everything has been overwhelming for so long that we’ve forgotten what it is to feel whelmed.

        <div class="content">
          On November 5th and 6th, Third Place Books is having their semi-annual used book sale. Every used book at all three Third Place locations will be 40 percent off. And they&rsquo;re trying something new this time around: if you visit and spend at least $5 at each location, you&rsquo;ll get a $10 gift card. It&rsquo;s going to be a long winter, and this is a great way to stock up your nightstand.

          I am so sick and tired of Donald Trump. I know this is not a unique opinion, or an especially interesting one, but it is an opinion that I want to shout in a very public place, or paint on a giant wall somewhere, with “sick” and “tired” both underlined three times for emphasis. It’s an imperative, a biological urge, like being hungry or needing to use a bathroom. My body is rejecting Donald Trump the way it would cast out a foreign organ.

          On Mars, water once flowed. Where
did it go? Some froze, but scientists
suspect a cosmic cue ball &mdash; a comet
etc. &mdash; knocked Mars so hard
the planet escaped
its own atmosphere, just
left it there, jumped its own skin
like an anime cat
leaving his pajamas spread-eagle
in space. And now, goddammit,
David Bowie is dead.
I worshipped him like a flower
twists its dewy face to the brightest,

          Sponsor University of Washington Press has given us permission to run an excerpt from Ernestine Hayes&rsquo; The Tao of Raven. Make sure you visit our sponsor&rsquo;s page to read it.
Hayes, a native Alaskan living in Juneau, wrote about returning to Alaska in her first book, Blonde Indian. This book, part memoir, part cultural exploration, tunrs Hayes&rsquo; unique voice to other stories, like completing college in her fifties and becoming a professor and writer.

          This is a neat idea: Alexander Chee is taking over the Hugo House&rsquo;s Instagram feed this week to provide teasers of the story he&rsquo;ll be reading at the House&rsquo;s Literary Series event this Friday.

          (Photo of Ebo Barton by Adam Rubinstein of [Stopped Down Studio](http://www.stoppeddown.studio/).) Earlier this month, Seattle poet [Ebo Barton](https://www.facebook.com/pg/ebobartonpoetry/about/?entry_point=page_nav_about_item&tab=page_info) took fifth place at the Individual World Poetry Slam in Flagstaff Arizona. We talked with them over email about the championship and the state of poetry in Seattle right now.
**Could you tell our readers what the process of getting to the Individual World Poetry Slam was like? How did you wind up delivering spoken word to an audience of people in Flagstaf?
