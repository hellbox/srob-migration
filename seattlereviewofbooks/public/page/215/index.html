          Hooray for Dr. Carla D. Hayden! As of yesterday, she&rsquo;s officially the 20th Librarian of Congress and, as Shelf Awareness notes, she&rsquo;s &ldquo;the first woman, and the first African American, to serve as chief executive of the Library of Congress.&rdquo;
 This Vulture profile of Helen DeWitt is definitely worth your time. And if you haven&rsquo;t read her long-out-of-print novel The Last Samurai, it&rsquo;s available again in finer bookstores everywhere.

          KUOW reporter Marcie Sillman filed a piece this morning about a new book conservation program at the University of Washington:
More than 10,000 items flow through the center every year; everything from fragile maps that need protective casings to books with torn bindings. Most of the binding work is outsourced to commercial binderies, but in-house conservators tend to the rare books, pamphlets and other delicate materials. If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered about the preservation of books, this is very much worth your time.

          The thing about writing a Superman story, I remarked a few months ago after watching the dreadful Batman V Superman movie, is that the conflict should be based in exploring the concept of morality. All the superheroic trappings — the laser eyes, the flight, the strength — are basically just window-dressing. This is why Superman is a character who easily splinters into many different personalities: when the character famously died in the 1990s, he “returned” as four distinct characters, each with their own variation on the Superman theme, and each with their own spin on what it means to be a moral person.

          Jason Weisberger writes about a San Francisco Little Free Library that was targeted by some vandals. This is, of course, outrageous and I&rsquo;m glad they keep putting the Library back up.
However, I have noticed that we&rsquo;ve seen a flood of Little Free Libraries in Seattle over the last year and a half, and I must say that the quality of books in those libraries has markedly decreased, with a lot of magazines, hopelessly battered paperbacks and dated technical books popping up all around town.

          **Wednesday July 13: *HEX* Reading**
Dutch author Thomas Olde Heuvelt’s horror novel *HEX* was a worldwide bestseller before it was even translated into English. Now it should become a bestseller in America, too; it’s got all the elements of a good horror yarn, including a witch’s curse, imperiled teens, a plague of suicides, and the fate of the known universe. *University Book Store, 4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/.

          Here’s a poem called “Red Lineage:”
My name is Vulnerable Red.
My mother's name is Staunch Red.
My father's name is Red-Eye Red.
I come from a people known for flagrance
& survival.

Remember me.
 Here is another poem called “Red Lineage:”
 “Red Lineage” is a poem told in variations, and written by many poets. In some of the poems, the mother’s name is Sea Red or Bad to the Bone Red and the father’s name is Mountain Red or Murder Red.

          “Life moves fast — books should too,” promises a promotional website for mega-bestselling author James Patterson’s new line of branded mini-novels. BookShots are Patterson’s take on the genre novella, a slick package intended to appeal to Twitter-friendly attention spans. BookShots.com promises that each of the thrillers and romances under the BookShot umbrella will be “Under 150 pages. Under $5. Impossible to put down,” and in case the breathless copy doesn’t get the point across, the site features a 30-second ad featuring a Patrick Bateman-looking young man being chased through the streets of a big city as he reads a BookShot:
