          It’s early in the year, time for taking on ambitious, resolution-worthy reading projects, and what better project than The Dying Grass, the latest novel from William T. Vollmann?
Vollmann, our young nation’s own Tolstoy.
Russia can keep Count Lev Nikolaevich and his high society, literary friends, peasant pedagogy, and pacifist moralism. Oh look, there’s Leo dressing up as a muzhik again.
Here in the modern-day U.S.A., we’ve got William Tanner Vollmann.

          In 2008, the Seattle International Film Festival hosted the film Battle in Seattle as its opening night gala presentation. Battle, a fictionalized account of the 1999 World Trade Organization protests, had the pedigree of a successful film: it starred Charlize Theron, Outkast’s Andre 3000, Woody Harrelson, Ray Liotta, and Channing Tatum, and it was scored by Massive Attack. At the opening night screening, the room clearly wanted to be on the film&rsquo;s side; Seattle desperately loves to see itself legitimized through adaptation, even if nine times out of ten it’s portrayed onscreen by Vancouver.

          You probably haven’t read The Scarlet Letter since you were in high school. That’s understandable. Most people recall The Scarlet Letter as an arduous reading experience. This is because The Scarlet Letter is not a book that should be given to teenagers. Its themes — of responsibility to the community, of the simultaneous importance and uselessness of personal reputation, of id and ego — are way too sincere and nuanced for any hormone-addled teenager to understand.

          "The hard part was sorting it all out. The hard part was taking a good look at everyone else and the way they looked at the world, which was a lot different than the way _I_ was looking the world." - Kate Bornstein, *Gender Outlaw*.  "What if we're not trapped in the wrong body, but trapped in the wrong society?" - Juliet Jacques There's an old Benny Hill sketch where his randy simple-minded character is walking down the street, behind a blonde with luxurious long hair.

        <div class="content">
          Matt Ruff had me a few pages into his new novel, Lovecraft Country, where one of its black characters ponders my own great childhood shame this way: “Tom Swift &hellip; which Earl had loved when he was young … embarrassed him now, both for the books’ depiction of Negroes and for the fact that as a boy he hadn’t noticed it &hellip;.” Because Ruff’s book has the mid-1950s as its setting, Earl almost certainly refers to the original series of Swift novels, which predate WWI and even have a white character use the expression “nigger in the woodpile.

          I love Simon Joyner’s music already — I don’t listen to it all the time, or even every year, though I always come back — but I was unsure about this collection. Lyrics are not, I think, “poems without their clothing,” as Dennis Callaci writes in his introduction to Only Love Can Bring You Peace, Joyner&rsquo;s first book. Dudes: poems are not naked songs. Not everything is purer, more vulnerable when stripped.

          It&rsquo;s gauche, I know, for a reviewer to ask a favor of his readers. In 2016, a book critic should be happy to be read at all. But I’m going to ask something of you, regardless — and hopefully you’ll get something out of this, too, besides the glow of internal warmth that comes from knowing that you indulged the whims of a tired old book reviewer. My request is this: print this review out.

          In 1860, Mrs. Elizabeth Packard had a conversation with a traveling sewing machine salesman. Her husband, a Calvinist minister named Theophilus Packard, was on her mind. Elizabeth had recently caused quite a ruckus when she stood up in the middle of one of her husband&rsquo;s sermons, and announced that she was crossing the street to the Presbyterian church, whose religious views aligned better with hers.
&ldquo;She found fault that Mr. Packard would not discuss their points of difference in religion in an open manly way instead of going around and denouncing her as crazy to her friends and to the church,&rdquo; the salesman later testified.

          If you hold a copy of Tom Hart’s new graphic novel Rosalie Lightning away from you by the spine, here is what you’ll see:
![](/webhook-uploads/1453965563321/RosalieLightning.jpg)
The pages are stratified in asymmetrical bands of black and white — thick stretches of white broken up by occasional, quick bursts of black, with one dense stand of black pages. You see this kind of striation in black-and-white comics collections all the time, but in Rosalie Lightning, it looks more portentous.

          In The Argonauts, Maggie Nelson seeks to clear things up by muddling them, by sweeping a careful hand through our delicate Manichean constructs of what’s gay, trans, queer, female, and more. In a mixture of memoir and critical meditation, Nelson recounts her relationship with her partner Harry Dodge, her efforts to become pregnant, and the birth of her son, Iggy, using the quotidian tools of family-building to pick apart our words and notions.
