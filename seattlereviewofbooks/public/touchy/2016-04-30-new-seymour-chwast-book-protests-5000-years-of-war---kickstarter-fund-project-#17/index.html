<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">_[New Seymour Chwast Book Protests 5,000 Years of War](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1204158310/new-seymour-chwast-book-protests-5000-years-of-war)_. We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[ Designers &amp; Books](http://www.designersandbooks.com).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>Design icon Seymour Chwast has used his art to battle war since 1957. His new antiwar book features 70 pages of original illustrations.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">They aren't kidding when they call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Chwast" title="Seymour Chwast - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Seymour Chwast</a> a design icon. He's a founder of the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_Pin_Studios" title="Push Pin Studios - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Push Pin Studios</a>, and designer of many recognizable things in American life. The Happy Meal box, for example. 
</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s used his illustration over the years to tell many stories, maybe most importantly, his anti-war message. In 1957 he published a book called <em><a href="http://www.seymourchwastarchive.com/collection/a-book-of-battles/?c=book" title="A Book Of Battles | Seymour Chwast Archive">A Book of Battles</a></em> (good luck finding one today, the go for upwards of $4500 when they come around). This new volume is a new book, with a collection of line drawings done especially for it, collected with words to form his message &mdash; showing the brutality and idiocy of war.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">Well, first, if you're a designer or a design appreciator, this will be a must-have, for the content itself. Second, it's being brought to life by an incredible team, such as editor Steven Heller. Designers &amp; Books previously released another Kickstarter for a book reproducing an extremely rare book by <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1204158310/ladislav-sutnar-visual-design-in-action-facsimile?ref=users" title="Ladislav Sutnar: Visual Design in Action - Facsimile Edition by Designers &amp; Books &amp;mdash; 
Kickstarter">Ladislav Sutnar</a> that turned out marvelously. They know what they're doing.</p>

<p>And there are some great rewards, with many pieces from Chwast&rsquo;s long history working on design. Trust me. Even if you don&rsquo;t know his name, you&rsquo;ve seen his work.</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">They're going for a big ask: $94k. They've well on their way to $28k of that so far, with 40 days left to go. Let's hope they make it. This is a book that deserves to be in the world.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
