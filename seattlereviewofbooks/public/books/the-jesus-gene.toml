Raised in a Brooklyn ghetto by parents Jack knows aren't really his, nothing has prepared him for the beautiful ghost that suddenly appears in his taxi, claiming she's there to keep him safe from the demon that's hunting him - a real live demon who will stop at nothing to make sure Jack - and the bloodline he carries - is completely obliterated from the face of the earth...."
