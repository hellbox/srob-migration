In a provincial town that feels desperately too small, this coming-of-age story revisits oppression and loss behind the grim Iron Curtain, and the many secrets surrouding Magda\'s family. Why did men from the Polish secret police interrupt her brother\'s birthday thirteen years ago?\n\nIs truth always desirable?'
