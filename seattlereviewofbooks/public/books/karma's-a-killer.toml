description = 'When Seattle yoga teacher Kate Davidson agrees to teach doga (yoga for dogs) at a fundraiser for a local animal rescue, she believes the only damage will be to her reputation. But a few downward-facing dogs are the least of Kate\'s problems when an animal rights protest at the event leads to a suspicious fire and a drowning. The police arrest a woman claiming to be Kate\'s estranged mother and charge her with murder. To prove her innocence, Kate, boyfriend Michael, and German shepherd sidekick Bella dive deeply into the worlds of animal activism, organizational politics, and the dangerous obsessions that drive them. All while discovering that when it comes to murder, there\'s no place like hOMe. Praise: "Tracy\'s Weber\'s Karma\'s a Killer delivers on all fronts--a likably feisty protagonist, a great supporting cast, a puzzler of a mystery and, best of all, lots of heart."--LAURA DiSILVERIO, NATIONAL BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF THE READAHOLICS BOOK CLUB MYSTERIES, TWO-TIME LEFTY FINALIST FOR BEST HUMOROUS MYSTERY, AND COLORADO BOOK AWARD FINALIST'
