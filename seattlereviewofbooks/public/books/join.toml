description = 'What if you could live multiple lives simultaneously, have constant, perfect companionship, and never die? That\xe2\x80\x99s the promise of Join, a revolutionary technology that allows small groups of minds to unite, forming a single consciousness that experiences the world through multiple bodies. But as two best friends discover, the light of that miracle may be blinding the world to its horrors.\n\nChance and Leap are jolted out of their professional routines by a terrifying stranger\xe2\x80\x94a remorseless killer who freely manipulates the networks that regulate life in the post-Join world. Their quest for answers\xe2\x80\x94and survival\xe2\x80\x94brings them from the networks and spire communities they\xe2\x80\x99ve known to the scarred heart of an environmentally ravaged North American continent and an underground community of the \xe2\x80\x9cferals\xe2\x80\x9d left behind by the rush of technology.\n\nIn the storytelling tradition of classic speculative fiction from writers like David Mitchell and Michael Chabon, Join offers a pulse-pounding story that poses the largest possible questions: How long can human life be sustained on our planet in the face of environmental catastrophe? What does it mean to be human, and what happens when humanity takes the next step in its evolution? If the individual mind becomes obsolete, what have we lost and gained, and what is still worth fighting for?'
