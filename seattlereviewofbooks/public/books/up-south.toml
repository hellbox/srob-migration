description = 'In Up South, his second book of poems, Robert Lashley has gone deeper into the rituals, folklore, and ceremonies of Black Tacoma. This is a book about cities within cities, where the present has roots in decades of history, and the evidence of things unseen still guides people\xe2\x80\x99s actions. In different forms, voices, and modes of rhetoric, Lashley paints complicated, moving pictures of environments, and people trying to survive in them.'
