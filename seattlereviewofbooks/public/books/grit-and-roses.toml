description = "A musician's life is never easy. Touring; getting paying gigs (as opposed to being stiffed by the owner), the disorientation and loneliness of the road, the hustle to create something more permanent than a great show, that mythical Recording Contract; the drugs, the booze, the liasions.In stories reminiscent of Raymond Carver, Eugene Babb takes the reader into the heart of a life lived trying to create, to entertain, a life striving to find meaning in a stranger's smile and a cool drink, a back country sunset or the neon beacon in the distant dark."
