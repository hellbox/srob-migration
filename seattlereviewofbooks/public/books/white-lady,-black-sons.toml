description = '\xe2\x80\x9cGive me my baby. Now! Please, let me see him.\xe2\x80\x9d The nurse reluctantly handed the infant to the mother. She held her baby for just a moment, kissed his forehead and whispered \xe2\x80\x9cSomeday I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you again,\xe2\x80\x9d before the nurse whisked him away. It was 1969 and when eighteen year old Lisa discovered she was pregnant, she knew she was in trouble. She was white. The father was black.

White Lady, Black Sons: a memoir of adoption, abuse and awakening is debut author Lisa Richesson\xe2\x80\x99s riveting memoir of loss, sorrow and survival while she never gave up hope of being reunited with the son she\xe2\x80\x99d given up.
