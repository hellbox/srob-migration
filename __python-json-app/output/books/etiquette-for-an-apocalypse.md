description = "It's the 2020 apocalypse and Sophie Cohen, former social worker turned neighborly drug dealer, must keep her family alive amid those pesky end of the world issues: starvation, earthquakes, plagues, gang violence and alas more starvation. She investigates a serial killing and takes down the sinister emerging power structure while learning to use a pizza box solar oven, bond with her chickens and blast tin cans from the perimeter fence with a Ruger 9MM. In order to accomplish all this she must find a way to love her mother, accept her daughter's adulthood and reignite her moribund marriage. She might discover that a decentralized, consensus driven life -- without fossil fuels, iPhones and chocolate eclairs -- isn't the end of the world after all."
