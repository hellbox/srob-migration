description = "Exploring the luminous world of both well-known and obscure patron saints, this collaborative volume by artist Nia Michaels and poet Knox Gardner reimagines the iconography of prayer cards common in Catholic tradition. Reverent towards the past but unflinching in the dark recesses of our modernity, Twelve Saints invites meditation on the contradictions of holiness and of singular lives."
