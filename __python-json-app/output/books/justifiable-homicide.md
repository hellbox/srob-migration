description = "The $500 billion a year illegal drug trafficking business has a secret relationship with seemingly legitimate bankers and mainstream financial markets which is exposed by a story in the press that reverberates on front pages around the world.\n\nThe question that even legitimate investigators seem not to be asking is: \"Where's the Money?\"\n\nUnlikely partners Jon Reynolds, PhD (computer-encryption wunderkind who has a personal, vested interest in the outcome), and Katie Ruiz, a talented investigative reporter with a checkered past, devise a dangerous and clandestine plan to expose the business and the players in it \u2014 as well as to reveal to the general public the staggering proportions of the scheme. Implementing it means Jon and Katie will face cartels, violence, corruption, and an inept DEA \u2014 in addition to their own fears and demons.\n\nThis is a story grounded in real facts that exist in the real world \u2014 our world. It is also a telling statement about the impact that ordinary citizens can have on world events \u2014 an unlikely \"Power of One\" tale."
