description = "\"Written with great talent, momentum and ingenuity.\"\u2014Amos Oz\n\n\"One of the most intriguing writers in Israeli literature today.\"\u2014Haaretz\n\n\n\"A richly textured panorama of German and Russian life\u2026This ample novel lives most memorably through Baram's vignettes of people, dwellings, cities, landscapes and the like that seem to lie, at times, at the periphery of its central concerns.\"\u2014Sydney Morning Herald\n\n\n\"A groundbreaker\u2026Riveting reading.\"\u2014Qantas Magazine\n\n\n\u2018Astonishingly powerful\u2026[Good People is a] compelling, important story.\u2019\u2014The Listener, NZ\n\n\n\"The tale of ordinary, middle-class lives sucked into a moral maelstrom. It is compulsive and profoundly disturbing.\"\u2014Sunday Star Times\n\nIt's late 1938. Thomas Heiselberg has built a career in Berlin as a market researcher for an American advertising company.\n\nIn Leningrad, twenty-two-year-old Sasha Weissberg has grown up eavesdropping on the intellectual conversations in her parents' literary salon.\n\nThey each have grand plans for their lives. Neither of them thinks about politics too much, but after catastrophe strikes they will have no choice.\n\nThomas puts his research skills to work elaborating Nazi propaganda. Sasha persuades herself that working as a literary editor of confessions for Stalin's secret police is the only way to save her family.\n\nWhen destiny brings them together, they will have to face the consequences of the decisions they have made.\n\nGood People is a tour de force that has been showered with praise in many countries.\n\nNir Baram was born into a political family in Jerusalem in 1976. He has worked as a journalist and an editor, and as an advocate for equal rights for Palestinians. He began publishing fiction when he was twenty-two, and is the author of five novels in Hebrew. Several have been translated into more than ten languages and received critical acclaim around the world. In 2010 he received the Prime Minister's Award for Hebrew Literature.\n"
