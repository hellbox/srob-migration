description = "Love a little, die a little, and break the law. Trey Milligan did them all in one summer, and before his 14th birthday. Trey lives in Southern California with his parents and younger sister, but is spending the summer after 7th grade with his widowed grandmother in a small Tennessee town. The South becomes home to Trey, but also represents the freedom every child associates with the summer months. Three of Trey\u2019s friends \u2014 Wendy, Devon, and Larry \u2014 come to personify love, death, and the criminal element, challenges every child must, at some point, confront. Together, the trio builds an unasked-for bridge to adulthood for Trey. The warmth and comforts of a \u201csummer at Grandma\u2019s\u201d becomes a life-changing season of internal growth. None of the transformative events of this fateful summer, though, prepare Trey for the horror almost literally next door . . . the monster in hiding, and far too close to the girl he comes to love. A coming of age tale set in the summer of 1982, the story reflects the transition of a young man forced \u2014 over three months \u2014 to grow up in ways that typically require several years. Trey\u2019s grandmother, sister, and an older second-cousin help shape him through the most memorable summer of his life. But it\u2019s three friends \u2014 Trey\u2019s company \u2014 who forever change his life."
