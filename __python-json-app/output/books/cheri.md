description = "Two volumes of Colette's most beloved works, with a new Introduction by Judith Thurman. Ch\u00e9ri, together with The Last of Ch\u00e9ri, is a classic story of a love affair between a very young man and a charming older woman. The amour between Fred Peloux, the beautiful gigolo known as Ch\u00e9ri, and the courtesan L\u00e9a de Lonval tenderly depicts the devotion that stems from desire, and is an honest account of the most human preoccupations of youth and middle age. With compassionate insight Colette paints a full-length double portrait using an impressionistic style all her own."
