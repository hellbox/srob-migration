* We first [told you about this seven months ago](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/07/20/tacoma-is-very-close-to-finally-honoring-dune-author-frank-herbert-with-a-park/), and now it's [officially a reality](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article199941624.html): Tacoma has named a new park after the life and works of sci-fi author Frank Herbert. "Dune Peninsula at Point Defiance Park" is an 11-acre park featuring "Frank Herbert Trail." Tacoma Metro Parks commissioner Erik Hanberg told the *News Tribune* that Herbert's “experiences in Tacoma shaped his appreciation for the delicate balance of nature, so it feels right to attach his name to a park that reclaims toxic land.” The park is set to open by late summer or fall. We'll let you know when it opens, and we'll take a field trip down to check it out.

* Susan Fried at [the South Seattle Emerald writes about](https://southseattleemerald.com/2018/02/12/local-somali-community-bands-together-to-create-childrens-book/) how the Somali community in south Seattle got together with Seattle Public Libraries, Seattle Public Schools, and the Seattle Housing Authority to create a children's book that celebrates Somali culture and language. The book will soon be available in libraries and schools around the nation.
