If you're interested in creative uses of the comics format, or in innovative literary fiction, this week's sponsor sample is a must-see. Kevin Marshall's *Not Really an Emotion* walks the border between reality and dream, transforming the familiar comic book conventions (panels, speech bubbles) into something strange and new. The storyline of *Not Really an Emotion* is appropriately dreamlike: a young woman, meditating, hears music she can't forget, and seeks to recreate it through means both natural and fantastic. We can't do it justice here; spend just a few minutes with it [on our sponsorship page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships), and you'll be hooked.
