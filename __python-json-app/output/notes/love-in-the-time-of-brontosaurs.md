<p class="noindent">We're immensely grateful to this week's sponsor, Howard Robertson, for sharing an excerpt from his recent novel *Love in the Cretaceous* â€” which turns everything you learned from *Jurassic Park* on its head. In Robertson's Oregon, one hundred years from now, dinosaurs roam the earth, while humans are busy cutting off their own exit. Robertson, a notable local poet and fiction writer, throws his readers into the soup with love, loss, and extinction (and a very sinister cameo); the thrills in this one are metaphysical as well as primordial, as you'll see when you dip in. 

Sponsors like Howard W. Robertson make the _Seattle Review of Books_ possible. Did you know you could sponsor us, as well? Get your stories, or novel, or event in front of our passionate audience.
