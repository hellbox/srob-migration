Those special snowflakes in the so-called "men's rights movement" have targeted Australian bookstore [Avid Reader Bookshop](http://avidreader.com.au/events) for sharing a post by feminist writer Clementine Ford. In response, Avid Reader's social media manager has been [working overtime revealing the MRAs for the ridiculous babies they are](http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/bookshop-hits-out-with-humour-after-clementine-ford-post-uproar-20170627-gwz9hr.html):

A customer delivered an "anti-troll" sour cream and walnut cake to Avid Reader's booksellers, which certainly seems like it should become a tradition when the Nattering Nabobs of Nincompoopery target an innocent bookstore for basically no reason. Unfortunately, this seems like it might become a semi-regular occurence.
