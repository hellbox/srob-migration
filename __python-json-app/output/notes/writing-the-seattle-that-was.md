Seattle writer and editor Jaimee Garbacik has [put out a call for writers and artists](http://www.seattleghosts.com/2015/08/01/call-for-submissions/) to contribute to The Ghosts of Seattle Past, an "interactive art installation" about remembering the disappearing landmarks of Seattle:

<blockquote>Share your memories of our lost spaces, whether from last week or the last century. Send your photographs, drawings, and memorabilia. Write just a few lines or submit a long-form essay celebrating a place you held dear. Use the medium that tells your story best.</blockquote>

Submissions will close on August 31st. The exhibit will debut at the [Short Run Small Press Festival](http://www.shortrun.org/), which happens this year on October 31 at Seattle Center. (**Full disclosure**: I'm contributing an essay to this project, but I'm not getting paid for it. I just think it's a neat idea and I like to support neat ideas.)
