<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 
<p class="noindent"><strong>Everyone calls comics “graphic novels,” but a lot of great comics, like *Persepolis* and *Fun Home*, are non-fiction. So “novel” isn’t right. But some comics aren’t funny at all, and so “comic” books doesn’t make sense, either.</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>A couple of bookstores in town call their comics sections “graphica,” which seems really pretentious. Is there a better name for these books? Am I worrying about nothing?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Mark, Wedgwood</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>P.S. Sorry for the inanity of the question. I’m aware that the world is sitting on the precipice of Armageddon and a madman is in the White House, but I’d like to think we can walk and chew gum at the same time, metaphorically speaking.</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Mark,</p>

<p class="noindent">Life is full of irritating incongruities like the one you describe – tinfoil is really aluminum, jellyfish are angrily neither, and pro-life politicians who would defund Planned Parenthood are really smarmy fuck-weasels who despise half their constituency.</p>

Sometimes I wish I was poisonous, you know?

But personally, I like the word "graphica," which, as you point out, is more inclusive than "graphic novel" or "comic book." It reminds me of "novella," an approachable word that means, "I know you're a very busy person but I am a creature of few words and I would love to entertain you while you are taking a shit." Metaphorically speaking.

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>

<p class="noindent">P.S. Have you read [*The Impostor's Daughter*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316033060)? I highly recommend it. I also highly recommend hissing as a form of communication and using Dentine Ice as a martini garnish.</p>
