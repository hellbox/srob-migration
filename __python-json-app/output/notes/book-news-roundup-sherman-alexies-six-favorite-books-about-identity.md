* Sherman Alexie published [a list of his six favorite books about identity at *The Week*](http://theweek.com/articles/625353/sherman-alexies-6-favorite-books-about-identity). The books, which include Seattle author Sonya Lea, should absolutely be added to your very long list of books to check out the next time you're at the book store. You can also hear a great interview with Alexie about his new kids' book [on KUOW's site](http://kuow.org/post/sherman-alexie-his-new-kids-book-and-angst-being-jr).

* As part of their big 40th (!!) anniversary celebration, Fantagraphics announced that they're publishing their own institutional biography, and it sounds incredible.

<blockquote>The highlight of the anniversary celebrations will be the long awaited release of [*We Told You So: Comics As Art*](http://www.fantagraphics.com/wetoldyouso/), an irreverent, 600-page oral history of Fantagraphics edited by Tom Spurgeon with Michael Dean, as told through interviews with virtually every key player in the company’s history – as well as a few of its adversaries – and copiously illustrated with hundreds of photos, comics, drawings, and rare ephemera from the Fantagraphics vaults.</blockquote>
