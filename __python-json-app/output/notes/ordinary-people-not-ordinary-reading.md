<p class="noindent">Sponsor <a href="http://nicoledieker.com" title="Nicole Dieker">Nicole Dieker</a> is a wonder. You may have seen her reading around town, or seen her work as editor of <a href="https://thebillfold.com/@NicoleDieker" title="Nicole Dieker – The Billfold">The Billfold</a>, or writing on <a href="https://kinja.com/nicoledieker" title="Nicole Dieker">Lifehacker</a>, <a href="https://thewritelife.com/author/nicoledieker/" title="Nicole Dieker, Author at The Write Life">the Write Life</a>, and <a href="http://community.sparknotes.com/blog/contributor/ndieker" title="SparkLife: Posts by ndieker">Spark Notes</a>.</p>

She's also just published her debut novel, _The Biographies of Ordinary People_, and she's allowed us to run the full first chapter on our <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">Sponsor's page</a> for you to check out. We think you're gonna love it. The story is an episodic, ensemble narrative — think _Little Women_, or _A Tree Grows in Brooklyn_.
