The [*Brooklyn Magazine* piece about the whiteness of the New York publishing industry](http://www.bkmag.com/2016/02/24/you-will-be-tokenized-speaking-out-about-the-state-of-diversity-in-publishing/) is a must-read, and not just because it prominently features friend of the *Seattle Review of Books* Rahawa Haile. Go [take it all in](http://www.bkmag.com/2016/02/24/you-will-be-tokenized-speaking-out-about-the-state-of-diversity-in-publishing/).
