As we've mentioned, tonight is the very last Cheap Wine & Poetry event at the Hugo House. This is our pick for the best event of the evening; CW&P is a consistently great event, and this is its last time on the Hugo House stage before the House is demolished later this year. Further, the future of CW&P — and the answer to the question of whether CW&P even *has* a future — has not yet been announced. It's a milestone! 

But I wanted to tell you about two other great events happening tonight, because it is an unusually jam-packed Thursday night in literary Seattle.

* At Elliott Bay Book Company, Danielle Dutton, Tara Atkinson, and Jane Wong will read at 7 pm. Atkinson is a co-founder of the APRIL Festival and she writes excellent short fiction. Wong is one of Seattle's best poets. We've published [two of her poems](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/13/spoiled/) here at [the *Seattle Review of Books*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/29/apology-in-the-age-of-construction/). And Dutton is the publisher of Dorothy, an indpendent press that publishes great women writers. She's also the author of *Margaret the First*, a novel about a writer in 17th century England, when women were basically not allowed to be writers. This looks like it'll be a spectacular evening.

* And at [Third Place Books Ravenna](http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/poetry-april-natasha-moni-erin-malone-and-michael-schmeltzer), three Seattle poets are reading: Natasha Moni, author of *The Cardiologist's Daughter*; Erin Malone, author of *Hover*; and Michael Schmeltzer, author of *Elegy/Elk River* and *Blood Song*. (Malone [published a great poem titled "Time Capsule"](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/17/time-capsule/) here at the *Seattle Review of Books* a few months ago.) This is a high-quality lineup of wonderful Seattle poets celebrating National Poetry Month in one of our most charming neighborhood bookstores. What's not to love?

Every week, I go through all the upcoming events to find one literary event per evening to recommend to readers of the *Seattle Review of Books*. Most nights, I have to decide between at least two cool-looking events. Tonight, there were three. Which one are you going to? Choose wisely.
