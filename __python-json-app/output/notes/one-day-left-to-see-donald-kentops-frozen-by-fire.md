Our thanks to sponsor Donald Kentop. His book,[ _Frozen by Fire_](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships "The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships"), examines the 1911 Triangle Factory Fire in verse. Kentop will be appearing this Sunday, November 15th at 2:00pm, at the Ballard branch of the Seattle Public Library to read from this impressive work. 

You can read [two poems from the book on our sponsor page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships "The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships"). We encourage you to support local poets and artists, and taking a moment to look on our sponsor page is one easy way to do that. If you like what you see, consider purchasing the book or going to Kentop's reading. 

And if you're interested in reaching an eganged audience (like yourself), who love books and want to support local works, you may be [interested in our Sponsorship program](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/ "The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books"). We have one week left in our initial block, and once that's gone we're 100% sold out. Support the work we do with news, with publishing (and paying!) local poets, as well as our book reviews. It's our part of our campaign to make internet advertising 100 less terrible.
