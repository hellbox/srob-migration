The University of Washington Press is our sponsor this week, and they're here to show Kathleen Alcalá's new book _the Deepest Roots_. Our [sponsor's page has more details](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships), and the most beautiful book trailer we've ever seen. 

Alcalá's exploration of food, land, and family, focusing on her home on Bainbridge Island, is an exploration of the things it takes to create a home and sustain it over generations.

It's thanks to sponsors like the University of Washington Press, and readers like you, that we're able to keep the pixels lit up here at the _Seattle Review of Books_. We've <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">just released our next block of sponsorship opportunities</a>. Check them out on the sponsorship page, and grab your date before they're gone.
