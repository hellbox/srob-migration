* The Eisner Awards were announced at San Diego Comic Con this weekend. The *Seattle Review of Books* has praised some of the big winners at the show, including [*Paper Girls*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/05/thursday-comics-hangover-the-weird-dawn-light-of-paper-girls/) and [*Nimona*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/drawn-this-way/). Seattle-area Eisner winners include Fantagraphics Books, which won for its wonderful archival reprinting of [*The Eternaut*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-sky-is-falling/); Matthew Inman of The Oatmeal; and translator [Zack Davisson](https://hyakumonogatari.com/about/), who worked on *Showa, 1953–1989: A History of Japan*.

* [Here's another sign](http://the-digital-reader.com/2016/07/25/new-survey-shows-used-and-rented-textbooks-still-trump-e-textbooks/) that ebook adoption has stalled: the "largest proportion of students, 67 percent, buys used textbooks, 55 percent rent, 25 percent buy new and 25 percent download e-books."

* Bookstore chain [Hastings is going away this fall](https://teleread.org/2016/07/22/hastings-set-to-liquidate-close-all-126-remaining-stores/):

<blockquote>After filing for bankruptcy in June, Hastings has been unable to find a buyer who would be willing to keep it in business, so it’s time to liquidate. Hastings is expected to close all 126 of its stores by the end of October.</blockquote>
