Our sincerest thanks to Janine A. Southard for sponsoring _The Seattle Review of Books_ this week. Sponsorships are very important to us. Why? [Because internet advertising is horrible and we're trying to do something about it](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/).

So, instead, we offer a full chapter from Southard's hilarious, and well-loved *Cracked! A Magic iPhone Story* (four stars on Amazon!) book. The award-winning Southard (a Seattle denizen) shows you how the geeks of Seattle live, provides a running and often-hilarious social commentary on todayâ€™s world, and reminds you that, so long as you have friends, you are never alone.

Help support The *Seattle Review of Books* by [reading her excerpt](/sponsorships/) and ordering the novel if you like what you read.

Thanks to Janine for her support, and thank you for taking a look.
