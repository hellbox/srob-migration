I try not to give Birth Movies Death any web traffic these days due to [the noxious way the site's owner protected former BMD editor Devin Faraci in the wake of sexual assault accusations](http://www.thedailybeast.com/how-a-sexual-assault-accusation-against-a-feminist-film-blogger-shook-up-the-indie-film-world). But it's impossible for me to separate my viewing of *Kingsman: The Golden Circle* from [a 2015 essay on the original *Kingsman* film by Film Crit Hulk](http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/07/17/film-crit-hulk-smash-kingsman-and-the-maybe-genius-of-non-winking-satire). 

I found the first *Kingsman* movie to be boorish and awkward in its handling of James Bond satire, though I did appreciate the way the film addressed the inherent classism of the Bond mythos. Hulk's essay didn't necessarily convince me to reappraise *Kingsman* as a brilliant work of art, but he did argue that the filmmaker, Matthew Vaughn, knew exactly what he was doing with the film: that Vaughn was producing, essentially, the world's only honest blockbuster movie — one that embraced the political discomfort of Bond movies.

*Kingsman*, of course, is adapted from a comic book series written by Mark Millar, an amoral dolt who has lowest-common-denominatored his way to great success. (I [wrote about Millar in this space](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/08/24/thursday-comics-hangover-dumbforgiven/) not so long ago.) Vaughn has taken the basics of Millar's premise — what if a poor kid became the next James Bond? — and made all the class issues entirely overt. Young Eggsy (a charismatic Taron Edgerton) is a chav who gets recruited by a Bond-like agent (Colin Firth, clearly having a lot of fun) to join a secret organization of spies who defend England from outsize global villains.

Despite a few missteps, (Samuel L. Jackson offers maybe his worst performance since Frank Miller's *Spirit* adaptation) even the most skeptical viewers had to admit that *Kingsman* was entertaining as hell, a skosh of R-rated blockbuster ultraviolence to while away time in the multiplex.

*The Golden Circle* will likely not invite a high level of investigation from writers like Film Crit Hulk. It is, to put it bluntly, a bad movie. It's boring and it's weighed down with exposition and the attempts at humor don't land successfully. If the first film was a sly investigation of class, the second film can't even convincingly sell itself as an investigation of how awful sequels usually are.

Of course, parts of *The Golden Circle* work really well: Vaughn's action sequences are buttery-smooth and boundlessly fun to watch. Julianne Moore, as the breathlessly chipper drug-dealing villain, is fantastic. Her character's plans to change the world are more interesting than your standard movie bad-guy dreck. Edgerton and Firth maintain their excellent rapport from the first film.

But most of *The Golden Circle* is self-serious and overblown. Channing Tatum shows up for about ten minutes of screentime, total. Some of the action sequences feel weirdly weightless. Other scenes fail to keep the plot moving forward. I have a hard time picturing any serious claim that *The Golden Circle* is another showcase of Vaughn's sly satirical skills. The class elements of the first film have basically disappeared, and the Bond nods feel less playful and more obligatory.

*The Golden Circle* is one of those rare sequels that actively diminishes the film that came before it. It's a film that's just as dumb as the comic that inspired it.
