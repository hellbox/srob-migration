<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1508703645203/Fly%20to%20the%20Assemblies_150.jpeg)</p>

<p class="noindent">We're excited to bring you an excerpt from _Fly to the Assemblies!: Seattle and the Rise of the Resistance_, courtesy of sponsor Third Place Press this week. _Fly to the Assemblies_ is a new anthology of writing from Seattle's top thinkers &mdash; journalists, activists, and others &mdash; that speaks to what the city is already doing in this time of political crisis and what we need to do next. As editor, Marcus Harrison Green has brought together a stunning group of voices to engage you on the page &mdash; or in person at the Nov. 2 launch event.</p>

Third Place Press chose "On fear and anger and fighting back,” by Reagan Jackson, to share with _Seattle Review of Books_ readers. You know Jackson's writing from _Crosscut_, _The Seattle Globalist_, and elsewhere; this piece is a suckerpunch of truth and fury. Read the essay, and an eloquent note about the book's publication from Third Place's Vladimir Verano, on [our sponsor page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/).
