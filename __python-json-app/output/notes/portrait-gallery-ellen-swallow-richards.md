Today is the birthday of [Ellen Swallow Richards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Swallow_Richards "Ellen Swallow Richards - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"). She was an American chemist and author, the founder of the Home Economics movement, the first American woman to earn a degree in chemistry, the first woman admitted to MIT, and the first woman to teach at MIT. 

She was a feminist (some say the first eco-feminist), and was an environmental scientist who studied air quality, groundwater, soil, and food. She authored books about science for use in the home, particularly about nutrition and sanitation, bringing a scientific rigor to what once was the realm of hand-me-down tales. 

You can see [all of her books on Archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Richards%2C+Ellen+Henrietta+%28Swallow%29%2C+1842-1911%22 "Internet Archive Search: creator:"Richards, Ellen Henrietta (Swallow), 1842-1911""), but, you the one you might find most interesting is [_The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning: A Manual for Housekeepers_](https://archive.org/details/chemistrycooking00richiala "The chemistry of cooking and cleaning; a manual for housekeepers : Richards, Ellen Henrietta (Swallow), 1842-1911 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive").
