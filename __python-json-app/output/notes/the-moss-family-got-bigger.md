The introductory letter in [the brand-new 5th issue of the online literary magazine *Moss*](http://www.mosslit.com/vol02/issue05.html) begins, "our team has grown substantially since our last release," welcoming "five new contributing editors." It's not readily apparent when reading the issue, which feels like the issues that have come before, but that's what you want in a staff expansion: unless your publication is suffering an existential crisis, editorial shifts are generally best felt only subtly. 

So the format of this issue of *Moss* is very familiar: an interview with Portland writer Mitchell S. Jackson about regionalism and gentrification, fiction from Leyna Krow and Sonya Chung, non-fiction from Tiffany Midge and Leah Sottile â€” the latter of whom contributed a moving meditation on love and death. All for the impossibly low price of free. [Go spend some time with the new issue](http://www.mosslit.com/vol02/issue05.html).
