Originally from El Salvador, Claudia Castro Luna is Seattle's first Civic Poet, a new position that runs for two years. She was selected from among 21 applicants and holds an MA in urban planning, an MFA in poetry, and a teaching degree. She teaches and writes in Seattle, also dedicating herself to gardening and raising chickens with her family. She'll be reading [this Saturday](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/08/03/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-august-3rd-august-9th/), August 6 at the Good Arts Building in Pioneer Square.
