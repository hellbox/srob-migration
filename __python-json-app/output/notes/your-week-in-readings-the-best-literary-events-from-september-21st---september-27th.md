<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday September 24th: *Vow of Celibacy* Reading**</h5></p> 
Standup comedian Erin Judge’s new coming-of-age novel is about a bisexual aspiring fashion designer with body image issues who takes a vow of celibacy in hopes of figuring out out why her life is such a mess. Judge will be joined by some other comedians, making this less of a reading and more of a mini-standup comedy festival.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday September 25th: *LOSER: The Real Seattle Music Story* Reading**</h5></p> 
Once upon a time, young people were flocking to Seattle to take part in its music scene.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday September 26th: *Here I Am* Reading**</h5></p> 
A decade ago, Jonathan Safran Foer came to Seattle for a triumphant reading to celebrate his second novel, *Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close*. Tonight he returns with his third novel, and reviews have been…less than kind. (There’s a scene where a husband makes his wife orgasm by staring at her vagina.) It’s time for some good old-fashioned literary rubbernecking.

Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*
