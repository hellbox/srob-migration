We here at the *Seattle Review of Books* are incredibly excited for Link Light Rail to open to Capitol Hill and the University District. (Fun fact: light rail opens on the exact same weekend as the [APRIL Festival's big book fair at the Hugo House](http://www.aprilfestival.com/2016-festival/)! That's your Sunday, March 20th all sorted for you.) And this video from Sound Transit profiling Seattle cartoonist Ellen Forney is only getting us more excited about launch-day, especially because it's got plenty of footage of the installation of Forney's beautiful illustrations of giant hands in the Capitol Hill station.
