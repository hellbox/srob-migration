* Seattle poet (and the current [poet in residence here at the *Seattle Review of Books*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/daemond-arrindell/)) Daemond Arrindell is the curator for the 2018 Jack Straw Writers program. That means Arrindell will choose the writers who take part in the program, and he'll take a leadership role as the writers learn how to share their work as spoken word and in recordings. Jack Straw is taking applications for the program through November 1st. [You can apply right here](http://www.jackstraw.org/programs/asp/2018_apps.shtml).

* [*Electric Literature* reports on](https://electricliterature.com/indie-bookstore-demonstrates-how-to-deal-with-the-alt-right-f929b9d34e1b) what one indie bookstore did when some fascists came in and tried to use their store as a marketing campaign for an alt-right douchebag's book.

* Headline of the week: "[I Bought a Book About the Internet From 1994 and None of the Links Worked](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/paabgg/i-bought-a-book-about-the-internet-from-1994-and-none-of-the-links-worked)." We think of the internet as lasting forever, but the truth is that this is a very fluid medium.

* A Texas assistant principal was forced out of his job after self-publishing a children's book. It sounds [truly awful](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/08/15/an-assistant-principal-wrote-a-childrens-book-about-alt-right-mascot-pepe-the-frog-it-cost-his-job/?tid=sm_tw&utm_term=.2b9f96733887#comments) — and by "it," I mean the book, not the fact that the guy lost his job:

<blockquote><p>The book features allusions that may go over some children’s heads. The setting is a farm called Wishington. The antagonist is a bearded alligator named “Alkah.” Astute readers will recognize Covfefe cliff. But perhaps the most inflammatory aspect is the smiling cartoon frog, which NBC News has called a “popular white nationalist symbol.” “Pede,” the name of the cartoon centipede that also graces the book’s cover, is also a term members of a Donald Trump-themed Reddit board use to refer to each other.</p>

<p>Spoiler alerts ahead, but Pepe and his centipede sidekick Pede start the book ecstatic that the old farmer has left after eight years of oppression. But Alkah and his minions have entrenched themselves in a pond that very much resembles a swamp — and are threatening to spread throughout all of Wishington Farm. Pepe and Pede have one weapon to vanguish the gator: buds from the honesty tree.</p></blockquote>
