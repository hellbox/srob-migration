<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday July 20: *Remembering Healing Celebrating* **</h5></p> 
Five Seattle-area poets — Priscilla Long, Jack Remick, Holly Hughes, John Wright, and Bethany Reid — read new work about “the past, lost poets, extinct birds, lost loves, and extending and expanding the meanings of elegy.” One of the top three best uses of poetry is remembering. (The other two? Sex and jokes.)

 * Third Place Books Ravenna, 6504 20th Ave NE, 525-2347 http://thirdplacebooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday July 21: *You'll Grow Out Of It* Reading**</h5></p>
*Inside Amy Schumer* head writer Jessi Klein’s memoir addresses what it means to be a woman in the 21st century. Tonight, beloved Seattle author Lindy West will join Klein in a far-reaching conversation about femininity, the idea of being a tomboy, and whether or not it’s biologically  possible for men to be funny.

 *University Book Store,  4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, http://bookstore.washington.edu. $27.50. All ages. 8 p.m. * 


<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday July 22: *Welcome to Night Vale* **</h5></p>
The horror/comedy podcast *Welcome to Night Vale* gets credit for being hilarious and inventive, but it’s also an impressive serial writing achievement: installment by installment, and in tonight’s live show, *Welcome to Night Vale* is building a mythology on the backs of American horror legends like Poe and Lovecraft. 
 *Benaroya Hall,  200 University St., 215-4747, http://seattlesymphony.org. $27.50. All ages. 8 p.m. * 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday July 23: Rainier BAAMFest**</h5></p>
Today’s Rainier Beach Arts and Music Fest features visual arts, crafts, dance, and music. But because I’m a book guy, let’s focus on the literary offerings, including spoken word, graphic novel-making workshops, Coast Salish storytelling, and a performance by Seattle-area spoken word dynamo Reagan Jackson. 
 *Rainier Beach Community Center and Pool,  8825 Rainier Ave S., 386-1925, http://facebook.com/BAAMFest. Free. All ages. 11 a.m. *


<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday July 24: *Alice & Lucy Will Work for Bunk Beds* Reading
**</h5></p>
You know who loves going to readings? Kids. This is because kids are better than adults, who waste all their time binge-watching *Law & Order* and reading hot takes about *Pokémon Go*. Seattle author Jaime Temairik debuts her new kids’ book with a reading and a literal cake walk at her neighborhood bookstore.

*Secret Garden Books, 2214 NW Market St., 789-5006, http://secretgardenbooks.com, free, all ages, 1 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday July 25: *The Heavenly Table* Reading**</h5></p>

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday July 26: Clarion West Presents Geoff Ryman**</h5></p>
Geoff Ryman is probably one of the most underappreciated living legends of sci-fi. Perhaps best-known for his multi-tiered Oz-centric fantasia *Was*, Ryman also created a hyperlinked online novel called *253* that was decades ahead of its time. This should be a rare peek inside the mind of a singular genius. Seattle
