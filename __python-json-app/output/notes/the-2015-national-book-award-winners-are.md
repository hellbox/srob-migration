If you didn't [watch the livestream](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/19/national-book-awards-ceremony-live-stream/), here's who won the National Book Awards this year:

**YOUNG PEOPLEâ€™S LITERATURE**
Neal Shusterman, *Challenger Deep*

**POETRY**
Robin Coste Lewis, *Voyage of the Sable Venus*


**FICTION**
Adam Johnson, *Fortune Smiles*


**NONFICTION**
Ta-Nehisi Coates, [*Between the World and Me*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-seattle-of-your-nightmares/)

Of course people have opinions about which books should have won. A lot of folks were pulling for Noelle Stevenson to win the young adult award with her comic *Nimona*, for instance. And the favorite to win the fiction award was Hanya Yanagihara's *A Little Life*. If you have any dobut about Yanagihara's genius, you should [attend her reading at University Book Store this Friday](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=11&evyear=2015&eventid=2015091409485100&pre=20151110&pst=20151126), where she'll be interviewed by Shelf Awareness's David Wheeler. The reading is free.
