Sometimes we hear about events too late to get them in the readings calendar for the week, but we still think they're worthy events that you should know about. Here are two:

1. Tomorrow from 3 to 6 pm, it's [Trivia for a Cause](https://www.facebook.com/events/1296943443718242/) at Green Bean Coffeehouse in Greenwood. This event is a fundraiser for [the Eastside Mosque](http://www.eastsidemosque.com/), which was [damaged in an arson fire back in January](http://komonews.com/news/local/fire-burns-eastside-mosque-one-arrested). There will be readings from Seattle poet [Samar Abulhassan](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/02/in-response-to-cd-wrights-questionnaire-in-january/), eight rounds of trivia, and a set from comedian Wilfred Padua. Admission is $20. If you can't attend because you're busy doing [Independent Bookstore Day](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/04/26/literary-event-of-the-week-seattle-independent-bookstore-day/), you can [donate directly to the mosque here](http://www.eastsidemosque.com/).
2. On Tuesday May 2nd, [Town Hall Seattle is hosting a reading for the poetry anthology *Raising Lilly Ledbetter*](https://townhallseattle.org/event/raising-lilly-ledbetter/), which celebrates women at work. I [reviewed this anthology back when it was first released in 2015](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-ballad-of-rosie-the-riveter/), but now that we have a Grabber-in-Chief who surrounds himself in the workplace with aggrieved white men, it's even more relevant. If you're looking for a bit of empowerment through art, this is the reading for you.
