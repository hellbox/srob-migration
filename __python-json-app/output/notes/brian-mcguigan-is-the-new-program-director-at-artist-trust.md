This e-mail from Artist Trust is great news:

<blockquote>Artist Trust is pleased to announce that Brian McGuigan has been hired as its Program Director.

McGuigan has worked in programs and marketing for over a decade at Hugo House and ArtsWest. He is the co-founder and curator of the popular reading series, Cheap Wine & Poetry and Cheap Beer & Prose; the director of Lit Crawl Seattle; and an ambassador for On the Boards. In 2010, *The Stranger* shortlisted him for their Genius Award in Literature, and in 2011, *City Arts* named him one of Seattle’s ‘Power 50 Culture Makers.’ When he's not working in the arts, Brian's a writer himself. His essays have appeared in Gawker, Salon, *The Stranger*, The Rumpus, *ParentMap*, and elsewhere, and he has received support from 4Culture, Artist Trust, and the Office of Arts & Culture.</blockquote>

Artist Trust helps all kinds of Seattle artists in every discipline with financial support and increased visibility. But speaking selfishly, *SRoB* is thrilled that such a **dedicated book guy** is taking over the programming. McGuigan knows every writer in town, and he's a passionate advocate for talent, both as a programmer and as a reader. 

What's more, he's **a spectacular programmer**; anyone who's attended the packed-to-the-gills Cheap Wine & Poetry and Cheap Beer and Prose readings series at the Hugo House knows McGuigan's a great events curator, and he brought energy, spontaneity, and passion back to the Hugo House's stage after a few rough years of misdirection. He knows how to throw a party, is what we're trying to say, and we can't wait to see what he does with this new role.
