**MONDAY** Your week of civic activism, Black Lives Matter, and a heavy dose of poetry begins at the [Fremont branch of the Seattle Public Library](http://www.spl.org/locations/fremont-branch/fre-events-at-this-branch?trumbaEmbed=eventid%3D117489919%26view%3Devent%26-childview%3D) with Floating Bridge Press's quarterly reading series An Evening of Poetry. This is **Elizabeth Austen**’s last Seattle-area appearance in her capacity as Washington’s poet laureate. ([Read about our new poet laureate here](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/07/spokane-poet-tod-marshall-is-washingtons-new-poet-laureate/).) Go and show her some love for all the hard work she’s put in as the public face of poetry. Other readers include **Angela Belcaster and Von Thompson**. 

**TUESDAY** We have a real rarity tonight: I can’t decide between the two top readings, so I’m going to tell you about them both. First up, [**Sara Brickman** features at the Round at Fremont Abbey](https://www.facebook.com/events/459990450852749/). Brickman, a Seattle poet who headed east for graduate school, is making a rare local appearance with other poets, a cellist, and “live painters.” Brickman is a lively reader, and it’ll be good to catch up with her recent work.

Also tonight, **Nick Licata** debuts his new book *Becoming a Citizen Activist* at [Couth Buzzard Books](https://www.facebook.com/events/752408068197906/). I [reviewed this one last week](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/how-nick-licata-won-seattle-politics/). Licata just left Seattle’s city council last week, and now he’s re-entering life as a private citizen. Be gentle with him.


**WEDNESDAY** [Elliott Bay Book Company](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/emily-johnston-drew-dillhunt-jeff-encke) hosts a launch party for Seattle poet **Emily Johnston**’s debut collection, *Her Animals*. She’ll be joined by **Drew Dillhunt**, the associate editor at *Her Animals*’s publisher, Hummingbird Press. Seems like a good way to introduce yourself to a Seattle-area small publisher and support Seattle poetry in one evening.

**THURSDAY** It’s time again for [Margin Shift](https://www.facebook.com/events/1008442805911637/), the Seattle poetry collective's reading series. Tonight’s readers are **Eddie Kim** from Seoul, Seattle poet **Samar Abulhassan**, and, up from LA, **Cathy Linh Che**. You won’t find a more geographically diverse bill in Seattle this week, and Margin Shift always puts on a good show.


**FRIDAY** Tonight’s best event is a talk titled “Black Lives Matter in Hip-Hop” at [Town Hall Seattle](https://townhallseattle.org/event/black-lives-matter-in-hip-hop/). A panel of local musicians, including **Wyking Garrett, Jace Ecaj, Nikkita Oliver, Suntonio Bandanaz, and Renaissance the Poet**, will talk about gentrification in hip-hop and the local Black Lives Matter movement. This one is important.

His newest book, *Finding Them Gone: Visiting China’s Poets of the Past*, is a photo-filled travelogue from Pine’s monthlong trip to China, during which he tried to learn more about the history of Chinese poetry.

**SUNDAY** [University Book Store](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=01&evyear=2016&eventid=2015110516084300&pre=20160108&pst=20160124) closes out our week with  “**Cindy Safronoff**'s comparative biography of late 19th century feminist activists Mary Baker Eddy and Victoria Claflin Woodhull." Eddy believed in marriage as an institution. Woodhull was a proponent of free love. They often disagreed. Passionately. The book is titled *Crossing Swords: Mary Baker Eddy vs. Victoria Claflin Woodhull and the Battle for the Soul of Marriage*, and it sounds totally fascinating.
