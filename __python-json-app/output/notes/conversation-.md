The rain pinched the glass<br>
of the windowpane.

The rain’s tiny pelts nagged at the glass<br
like the conversation<br>
she was avoiding having.

The avoidance made her feel<br>
removed from herself<br>
while at the same time even more<br>
introspective.

The room in which she sat<br>
was well lit, so outside<br>
looked like asphalt<br>
on a playground’s court.

She could see the orange ball,<br>
bouncing lower, lower, lower &mdash;&mdash;
until it stopped.

The ball, its visibility, then disappearance,<br>
reminded her<br>
that her words, too, dissolved like this. 

Or were her words, against the dark,<br>
a bright, bright blue?
