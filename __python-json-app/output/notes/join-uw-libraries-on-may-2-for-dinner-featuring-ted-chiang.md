<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1521520494674/Ted%20Chiang_150.jpg)</p>Every year the University of Washington Libraries host Literary Voices, a dinner to support the Libraries and this year, to provide scholarships for its student staff — a lovely idea and one from which we all benefit. Each year the keynote address is stunning; this year, the featured guest is Ted Chiang. Chiang's writing brought a kind of imagination back to hard science fiction that a lot of readers had stopped expecting, and he's applied the same lens, terrifyingly, to [the giants of tech](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tedchiang/the-real-danger-to-civilization-isnt-ai-its-runaway?utm_term=.bu1EgJaa5B#.oeA21VOOAr). It's sure to be a fascinating speech.

But wait: as excited as we think you should be about seeing Chiang, your hosts for dinner deserve equal attention. Every table at the event is shepherded through the meal by a notable Seattle writer or Pacific Northwest writer: Claudia Castro Luna, Ross McMeekin, Ijeoma Oluo, and more. You can see the full list [on our sponsorship page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/). Get your tickets now; they'll go fast.
