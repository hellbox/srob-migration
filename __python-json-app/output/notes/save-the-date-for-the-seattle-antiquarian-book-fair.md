<p class="noindent">This week's sponsor is the fabulous [Seattle Antiquarian Book Fair](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/), an annual event in which "the best bookstore in America" opens for two short days, puts the wonders of the world at your fingertips, and then vanishes â€” leaving nothing but a trace of bookdust.</p>

This year's event is October 14th and 15th, at the Seattle Center's Exhibition Hall. Just $5 gets you entry on both days, with access to more than a hundred exhibitors from the United States, Canada, England, and Spain, sharing rarities, collectibles, and ephemera. You won't want to miss it.

Sponsors like the Seattle Antiquarian Book Fair make the _Seattle Review of Books_ possible. Did you know we sold out our last sponsorship run? We're booked solid through the end of January, but if you have a book, event, or project you'd like to get in front of our readers, [reach out and let us know](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/). We'll be happy to crack open our calendars and reserve you ahead of the pack.
