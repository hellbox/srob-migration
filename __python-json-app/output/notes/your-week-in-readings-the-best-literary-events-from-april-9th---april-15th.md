<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday, April 9: *Make Trouble* Reading **</h5></p>
Cecile Richards is president of both the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Her book *Make Trouble* is about her life - protesting the Vietnam War as a child, growing up as the daughter of fabulous Texas governor Ann Richards, and fighting regressive anti-woman forces in her role at Planned Parenthood. Tonight, she'll be in conversation with Lindy West, who is having a big week — West is also interviewing author Samantha Irby at University Temple on Wednesday, April 11th, and she's headlining at Benaroya Hall on Sunday, an event that is our sponsorship this week.
*University Temple,  1415 NE 43rd St,634-3400, http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/, 7 pm, $27.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday, April 10: *Lawn Boy* Reading**</h5></p>
You'll be hearing more about Jonathan Evison's new novel *Lawn Boy* around here in short order. It's a book about a poor young man who barely makes a living as a landscaper on Bainbridge Island. Tonight is Evison's Seattle debut of the book, which is always a special event.
*University Book Store,  4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/, 7 pm, free.* 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday, April 11: *Parts Per Million* Reading**</h5></p>

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday, April 12:  *Chemistry* Reading**</h5></p>
Weike Wang's *Chemistry* was one of the most critically praised novels of last year. Finally, the coming-of-age novel is coming out in paperback. Wang will be discussing the book's success and its themes of race, success, and indecision with Seattle author Kristen Millares Young.
*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com, 7 pm, free.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday, April 13: Jasmine Gervais**</h5></p>
Seattle-area painter, sculptor, and passionate feminist rights activist Jasmine Gervais examines ideas of sexuality and society in her work. Among other works she's created, she has made these funny and oddly touching tableaus of people in the midst of what appear to be half-clothed, drunken hookups. The advertising copy for this event invites you to come see and discuss her work in "an anti-gravity, gloriously inclusive environment." 
*Greenwood Space Travel Supply Co., 8414 Greenwood Ave N, https://www.greenwoodspacetravelsupply.com/, 6 pm, free. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday, April 14: Grief and Release: Poetry as Elegy**</h5></p>
Hugo House's craft talk series continues with poet Ada Limón, who will celebrate National Poetry Month with a discussion about poetry and grief. Limón has a new book of poetry out this summer, and it seems quite possible that she might debut some of that work here at this reading tonight. 
*Frye Art Museum. 704 Terry Ave., 622-9250, http://fryemuseum.org, 7 pm, $15.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday, April 15: Examining Our Earth Through Poems**</h5></p>
April is National Poetry Month. April is also the month in which Earth Day happens. This event at Open Books combines those two worthy pursuits by asking poets to discuss "what environmentalism looks like and how it intersects with other injustices faced today." Seattle's Youth Poet Laureate Lily Baumgart hosts a reading and discussion about sustaining our planet featuring local talents Aisha Al-Amin, Quenton Baker, Namaka Auwee-Dekker, and Sierra Nelson.
*Open Books, 2414 N. 45th St, 633-0811, http://openpoetrybooks.com, 5 pm, free.*
