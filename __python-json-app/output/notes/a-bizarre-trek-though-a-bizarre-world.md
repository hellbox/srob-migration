<p class="noindent">Our sponsor this week is Conon Parks, and if you're a fan of weird adventures, twisted druggy paths through Seattle's political and social undergrounds, and reliving what the WTO protests were like through those filters, then you're going to love his novel _Empty Bottle of Smoke_</p>

<p>Read an excerpt from the first chapter on our <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">sponsorâ€™s page</a>, and pick up a copy in person at Third Place Books, Left Bank Books, or Village Books in Bellingham. Or, click through to pick one up online from Third Place Books.</p>
