Said the prayer to the dream<br>
I don't believe you want to hear me

Said the dream to paper<br>
I don't believe you want to hold me

Said the paper to the wind<br>
I don't believe you want to help me

Said the wind to the man<br>
I don't believe you see me

The man felt the wind whisper in his ear and swatted the dream <br>
that sounded like a prayer that was held by the paper

In one breath, the wind became an answer<br>
no one ever asked the question to

In one dream, the wind forgot its voice, in another dream the paper<br>
was torn before it learned how to say its own name

In the first dream, the prayer learned what walking through<br>
blackness feels like &mdash; it is the opposite of abandonment

In the last dream, all the names are written on the paper<br>
in the form of a prayer that sounds<br>
like the wind and feels like the breath<br>
of a flower across your cheek
