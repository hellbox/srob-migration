Normally, in this space, you'd find a [Seattle Writing Prompt](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/seattle-writing-prompts). Today we're pre-empting to bring you this reminder to enter our short story contest.

<p>So, writers, take note: <strong>August 15 is the deadline for our short story contest.</strong> Tidy up your commas, tighten up your characters, and hit &#8220;send&#8221; by midnight Tuesday. We can&#8217;t wait to see what you&#8217;ve made.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll pay $100 to publish the winning story — and run an interview with the author by co-founder Paul Constant the same week. Get your story in front of our readers, and get to tell your story to our readers. It's great exposure, and we're paying you to get it!</p>

<h5>Really, a writing contest, on a book review site?</h5>

<p>Yes. Seattle is home to fantastic writers, established and emerging, and we want to see your name on the site.</p>

<p>Every Saturday, we run <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/seattle-writing-prompts">the Seattle Writing Prompts</a>: a column that explores a part of Seattle and offers prompts based on the city&#8217;s history, or mis-history. Rain City&#8217;s home to a million stories, and many of them are yours.</p>

<p>This is our first-ever story contest, and we don't <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/18/love-canal/">publish fiction</a> [very often](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/christmas-ghost-story/). Our judge is local writer <a href="http://www.bymattruff.com/">Matt Ruff</a>, author of <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/caught-after-dark-in-lovecraft-country/"><em>Lovecraft Country</em></a> — just listed as one of the finalists for the Washington State Book Awards.</p>

<h5>How it works</h5>

1. Look through our <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/seattle-writing-prompts">Seattle Writing Prompts</a> archive and take inspiration from one of the prompts.

2. Write a short story whose concept was sparked by the prompt. You don’t need to follow it exactly, but it would be nice to see where you began. Format is open — flash fiction and comics score just as high as longform. Surprise us.

3. Submit your story, and let us know what prompt inspired it, by August 15, 2017. We’ll do an initial pass, then send them on to Matt Ruff. We’ll announce his pick here in early September.

4. Send to [submissions@seattlereviewofbooks.com](mailto:submissions@seattlereviewofbooks.com), with the subject line “Seattle Writing Prompts Contest Entry.”

<h5>About our judge</h5>

<p>Matt Ruff is the author of six novels; the most, recent, <em>Lovecraft Country</em> is a WSBA finalist and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/05/16/jordan-peele-signs-on-to-produce-matt-ruffs-lovecraft-country-as-a-tv-series/">set to become a series on HBO</a>, produced by Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams. Matt&#8217;s novel <em>Set This House in Order</em> was a Washington State Book Award winner in 2004.</p>

<h5>Fine print</h5>

<p>You’re selling us, essentially, first serial rights to your story. <strong>You retain full copyright to your work.</strong> There is no minimum or limit on word count, but we are looking for short stories instead of prose poems. You can be the arbiter of what that means to you. We consider comics short stories. We pay on publication. Interview will require you to meet with someone from the site for about 30 minutes, but that can be on Skype if you can’t do it in person. You do not need to live in Seattle to enter this contest, but we retain the right to weight stories with strong Seattle connections more heavily.</p>
