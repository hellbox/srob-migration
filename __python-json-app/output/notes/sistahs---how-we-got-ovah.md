<p class="intro">"_If Black English isn't a language,<br>
then tell me what it is._"<br>
&mdash; James Baldwin (1934 - 1989)</p>

<h5>Sunday Morning</h5>

Sun's up<br>
they say it's Sunday<br>
come to us again

Bacon and egg smells<br>
float over from Master's House<br>
somebody's smoking cigars<br>
maybe two somebodies

Cigars they come here<br>
by big riverboats<br>
breakfast china dishes<br>
they come too<br>
and ice for fancy get-togethers

Cost lots of money

Last Sunday<br>
they traded Jubilee<br>
my grownup cousin<br>
and Vashti my little sister<br>
to pay for all the cigars<br>
and all the breakfast china<br>
but not for all the ice

They said too much<br>
had melted on the way

_(for Octavia Butler)_

<h5>Fingers</h5>

I want to see fingers/ fingers flying across piano<br>
keys/ fingers strolling over black notes &amp; blue<br>
notes &amp; sharp notes &amp; flat notes &amp; get up in<br>
the morning notes/ fingers/ I want to see<br>
BB King fingers hitting Lucille's guitar strings

UM ain't that some stuff/ Nina Simone Queen<br>
of Soul fingers backing up The King of Love/<br>
Martin Luther King fingers &amp; hands pounding<br>
on America's pulpit/ yesterday &amp; now I Have<br> 
A Dream fingers/ fingers/ my great grandfather's <br>
CC Rider fingers taking the Bible to Black folks<br>
using their fingers to read/ my grandfather's<br>
chef fingers shaping fancy pastry &amp; roasting<br>
duck &amp; making people lick their fingers

UM ain't that some stuff/ fingers/ my mother's<br>
fingers/ my father's fingers/ all theses fingers<br>
pushing me into circles of light/ my fingers/<br>
this poem

<h5>Mirror Woman</h5>

<p class="noindent">_Mirror, mirror on the wall,<br>
who is the fairest of them all?_<br>
&mdash; Brothers Grimm, "Snow White"</p>

Let me tell you something.<br>
I'm a woman of African descent<br>
and that isn't just something.<br>
You hear me.<br>
It is some thing.<br>
Yes! I am a woman of African descent.

In a public library restroom<br>
caught a sistah standing behind me<br>
staring in the mirror at me.<br>
"Are you mixed?" she says<br>
at the back of my head.

I say to the mirror "What!"<br>
as in &mdash; What's wrong with you, Sistah!<br>
"Are you mixed?" she says<br>
one more time<br>
giving me the once-over<br>
as though she'd paid admission<br>
and was entitled.

Now I shake my hands dry.<br>
I say to the sistah in the mirror,<br>
"What!" as in<br>
What manners did yo Mama<br>
not teach you.

She blinks hard like I'm some<br>
kind of puzzle. "Mixed," she says,<br>
"You know, as in mixed!"<br>
"No No No!" I say.

"I am not mixed. I am nobody's<br>
mixed anything!" I hear my voice<br>
rising . "I am a woman of African<br> 
descent. Just like you!"

"Passing," she says interrupting.<br>
"Do you ever think of passing?"<br>
"Why?" I say without thinking. "Why would<br>
a woman of African descent want to pass?"

"Easier," she says. "Life would be easier,"<br>
she says. "Easier for what?" I almost say.<br>
"The Price of the ticket," I say. "That's<br>
what James Baldwin would say."

"Who's he?" she says.<br>
"Pass. You could do it." 

I want to hug her. Yes. Maybe I<br>
even want to give her my skin.

I move away<br>
leaving her free to talk with that<br>
other woman in the mirror.

<h5>Say My Name</h5>

Say my name please.<br>
Please say my name. Look at me when you say<br>
my name. My name. You put it in a bag and<br>
tied it with wires at the top where the paper, the<br>
parchment was peeling in little threads. Threads<br>
like my mother used when she hemmed my<br>
dress. Gauze. Gauze. Strips of gauze covered<br>
with mericrome and witchhazel and in the <br>
medicine cabinet with all those little bottles &mdash;<br>
amber, blue-cobalt blue &mdash; where she put my<br>
name before she closed the door, the mirror.

Wiped it clean.<br>
I wrote my name in the steam on the mirror. She<br>
wiped it clean, took my name away, this mirror<br>
woman who polished what was left of the<br>
light, the long could-be-singing nights with my<br>
name. Here in the twilight of the sighs and long<br>
meter hymns and someone breathing long and<br>
low and heavy in the dark of my name. I hear it<br>
low and sweet so sweet and hear, yes, the carry-<br>
me-back-words of my name riding in a boat<br>
with the gold leaf of its name Muerte &mdash; Muerte.

And on its sides,<br>
this ship with its polished wooden sides, this<br>
wooden carved maiden leading it in its name,<br>
this wooden carving with its long green hair,<br>
green sea waves... carry-me-back-waves/ carry<br> 
me back... Its rough lips wooden and pouting<br>
and half open, taking in the blue-green ocean<br>
waves and the foam, lips parted/ bared to the<br>
blue wind as if to say my name, to sing it into<br>
the blue-black wind.

Amazing Grace.<br>
And who was that woman! Say it. Spit it Out.<br>
Weave if from long colored banners from soft &mdash;<br>
as spring wool, from cotton, yes cotton. Cotton<br>
mouth. Poison. sssssssssssss. Please. Please say<br>
my name. Please.

Look at me.
