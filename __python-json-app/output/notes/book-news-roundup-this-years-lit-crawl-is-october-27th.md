* Lit Crawl Seattle [announced the date](https://www.facebook.com/LitCrawlSeattle/posts/1130578770309500) for this year's crawl: **October 27, 2016**. Save the date. (And if you didn't attend last year's Lit Crawl, [here's our roundup](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/23/started-from-the-bottom-now-were-here/) to give you an idea of what you missed.)

* The MFA in Creative Writing program at Whidbey Island's Northwest Institute of Literary Arts is in serious financial trouble. [Here's a letter from a student outlining the problem](https://www.facebook.com/bonny.becker.77/posts/10153572401133937) — "We are devastated to learn that, in the middle of our semester, we have no idea if we will continue," she writes — and [here's where you can donate to help](http://www.nila.edu/www/donate-to-nila/).

* Amazon has announced that they're opening a second Amazon Books physical location, [this time in San Diego](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-to-open-second-brick-and-mortar-bookstore-in-san-diego-2016-03-07?mod=MethodeStories). In case you haven't read my review of the first Amazon Books, [here's a taste of what San Diego is in for](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/09/the-algorithm-method/).

* This is something that anti-e-book commentators have been warning for years, and it [appears to be coming true in Great Britain](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/04/barnes_and_noble_pulls_out_of_blighty/?mt=1457362930924). Barnes & Noble's Nook e-book business is shutting down over there, and Nook users just received a warning that they're working "to ensure that you have **continued access to the vast majority of your purchased NOOK Books** at no new cost to you." Note that "vast majority," there. When you "buy" an e-book, you're really just licensing it; it's not like buying a physical book, it's like purchasing software. If the deal changes — if an e-book supplier goes under, for instance — you might not have access to your books anymore. Sounds like some British e-book buyers are about to learn that the hard way. 

* Harper Lee's will has [been sealed](http://www.mhpbooks.com/harper-lees-will-is-now-as-mysterious-as-her-second-novel/). Someone is going to write an amazing biography of Harper Lee at some point, and they're going to report on what really happened in the last years of her life. I hope that book comes out before I die.

* Brandon Hicks's ["Profiles of Cartoonists" at The Rumpus](http://therumpus.net/2016/03/145833/) is a very funny, if unfortunately typo-ridden, overview of the sad state of professional cartooning today.
