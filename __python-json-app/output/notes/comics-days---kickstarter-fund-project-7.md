<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">_[Comics days](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/comicsdays/comics-days?ref=discovery)_. We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Kristina Vilciauskaite Shephard](http://comicsdays.weebly.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>Comics days in Vilnius is the first international comics festival in Lithuania that will be held on 14 - 16 of April 2016.

</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	Independant comics festivals are the best. It's important for creators to have a place to gather and share their art, and talk to like-minded people to learn and make community. Think about how [vibrant our own Short Run Comix and Arts Festival is](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/short-run-for-the-long-haul/). 
</p>

So here are some folks trying to stage an international comics festival in Lithuania, called Comics Days, and it will be the first of its kind over there. That's a project we can get behind.

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">I'm guessing most of you reading this aren't in Lithuania, or aren't planning to visit for the festival. So, this raises the important question: _what's in it for me_?</p>

Art and comics! Look at their rewards. For as little as $5 you can get a sticker pack. There are posters, comics, and even original art. And the branded gear is beautiful, as are the posters. I know a few of you reading this salivate at the idea of some rare, cool foreign art in your collections. Here's your opportunity to snag some. 

Not to mention you're helping creators overseas get their community going. That's worth a few bucks.

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">21 days to go, and they've only raised about 18% of their $4,500 goal. So, they need the help. Pitch a bit in, let your friends know &mdash; those emails that a friend just backed a project on Kickstarter are pretty powerful. Let's see if we can't give them a little bit of a boost.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
