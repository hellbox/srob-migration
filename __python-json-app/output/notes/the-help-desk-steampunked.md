<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

<p class="noindent">**Can you explain steampunk to me? I have no idea what the hell is going on there.**</p>

<p class="noindent">**Danielle, Capitol Hill**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Danielle,</p>

<p class="noindent">Admittedly, I've never read a steampunk book. I do know the genre incorporates the more playful totems of the 19-century industrial revolution, such as goggles and gears and steam-powered gadgets, while ignoring the less romantic aspects of the era, like child slavery and cholera outbreaks.</p>

I like speculative fiction – _American Gods_ is fantastic and _Neuromancer_ is an all-time favorite – but I have a hard time getting enthused about books that play off nostalgia for bygone eras, and here's why: the 19th century sucked for most people – especially immigrants, women and children. Did you know, Danielle, that U.S. women weren't legally allowed to have bank accounts or take out lines of credit on their own, without a male co-signer, until the 1960s? Did you know that it was "recommended" that children work no more than 12 hours a day during the Industrial Revolution? Those are the kinds of enraging facts I think about when somebody mentions how cool Victorian bustles and top hats and pocket watches are. (This is also why I'm terrible at chit chat and a turd to bring to parties.)

But, again, I've never read steampunk because of my own personal bitchy biases. Like you, I don't get the appeal. But I'm willing to learn. Steampunk lovers, please send me recommendations for your favorite books. I promise to read them and report back.

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
