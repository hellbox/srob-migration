I'm taking part in a pair of upcoming events that you should know about:

* This Saturday, February 3rd, I'll be on a panel at [Literary Career Day](http://www.spl.org/calendar-of-events?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D126388054) at the downtown branch of the Seattle Public Library. This is a free event intended to offer information and encouragement to young people aged 16 - 24 who are interested in pursuing careers in the literary arts. It runs from 11 am to 4 pm, and [you can register here](https://onereel.org/literarycareerday). A description, from SPL's website:

<blockquote>This event will start with Keynote Speakers, followed by lunch—free for all attendees—and a Table Fair featuring opportunities from local arts organizations. After lunch, attend the Breakout Session that's relevant to your interests. We'll finish off the afternoon with a Networking Party, featuring a live DJ, to help you get the most out of your Career Day!</blockquote>

* I'm [interviewing Fran Lebowitz at Benaroya Hall on Sunday, February 18th](https://www.seattlesymphony.org/concerttickets/calendar/2017-2018/live-at-bh/benaroyahall/fran-lebowitz). Lebowitz possesses a remarkable wit — she's a natural heir to Dorothy Parker, Oscar Wilde, and other historical wiseasses. It's intimidating as hell to share a stage with her, and I'll certainly feel better if you're there to back me up. You should [read this interview from the last time Lebowitz came to town](https://www.thestranger.com/seattle/she-is-not-amused/Content?oid=12813434) that was conducted by my friend Bethany Jean Clement to get an idea of what I'm up against. This is terrifying for me, which means it should be fun, at the very least, to watch me squirm. Hell, I can guarantee that it will be entertaining to watch me get my clock cleaned by one of the funniest people alive.
