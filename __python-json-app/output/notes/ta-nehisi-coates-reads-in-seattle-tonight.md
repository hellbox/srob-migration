As I noted in my [Week in Readings](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/26/your-week-in-readings-the-best-events-from-october-26th-to-november-1st/) post on Monday, Ta-Nehisi Coates reads from his new book, *Between the World and Me*, tonight as part of the 2015-2016  Seattle Arts & Lectures season. The reading is **long since sold out**; if you don't have tickets already, you are out of luck.

But allow me to take this opportunity to tell you something: if you haven't yet read Coates's book *Between the World and Me*, you are missing out on **the most important book of the year**. I [wrote a review of the book](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-seattle-of-your-nightmares/) when it was released this summer. My review incorporated some then-current events, particularly the Black Lives Matter protesters who interrupted a Bernie Sanders rally in Westlake Park and in so doing kicked off a racist firestorm. 

I was wrestling at the time — still am, really — with the hypocrisy of Seattle's progressive self-perception. This is a racist city, and it refuses to recognize that it is a racist city. Seattle really needs to listen to what Coates has to say tonight. And if you think you don't need to read Coates's book, you probably do. Please [read my review](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-seattle-of-your-nightmares/), and then read the book.
