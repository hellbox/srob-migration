This morning, Donald Trump's White House filed a cease-and-desist order against Henry Holt, the publishers of *Fire and Fury*, an upcoming book by Michael Wolff about the interior workings of the Trump administration. The book, which was scheduled to be published on Tuesday, has already [made headlines](http://time.com/5087774/michael-wolff-book-cease-desist-letter-steve-bannon/) after several [gossipy excerpts](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/01/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-book-donald-trump.html) were leaked online.

Greg Evans [at Deadline](http://deadline.com/2018/01/fire-and-fury-publication-date-henry-holt-michael-wolff-donald-trump-1202235790/) reports that Henry Holt responded to Trump's cease-and-desist in exactly the right way:

<blockquote>“Due to unprecedented demand,” Holt said in a statement, “we are **moving the on-sale date for all formats of ‘Fire and Fury,’ by Michael Wolff, to Friday, January 5, at 9 a.m. ET**, from the current on-sale date of Tuesday, January 9.”</blockquote>

Fantastic! One thing: If you're interested in buying Wolff's book tomorrow, please make sure that you buy it from an independent bookstore. This book very likely has very little caloric content, politically speaking — the policies of the Trump administration are what matter, and what we should be obsessing over — so you should at least support the families of local booksellers with your purchase, rather than lining the pockets of [some other impossibly wealthy man](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/24/16697520/jeff-bezos-net-worth-100-billion-dollars-amazon).
