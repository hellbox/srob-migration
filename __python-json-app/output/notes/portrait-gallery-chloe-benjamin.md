<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday, January 11:** *The Immortalists* Reading**</h5></p>
<p class="noindent">
Author Chloe Benjamin’s latest novel, *The Immortalists*, is about a mystical prophecy that foretells death. It’s a clever addition to the genre of fiction based around the primal thought experiment centered around what you would do if you knew the exact date and time of your death. <br />*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com, 7 pm, free.*</p>
