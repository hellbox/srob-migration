**Looking for Betty MacDonald Reading**<br />
Betty MacDonald’s 1945 memoir about life on the Olympic Peninsula, *The Egg and I*, is an underappreciated Northwest classic. Seattle-area historian Paula Becker celebrates the UW Press’s republication of three long out-of-print books by MacDonald with a reading from her book which celebrates MacDonald’s history and legacy. <br />*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*</p>
