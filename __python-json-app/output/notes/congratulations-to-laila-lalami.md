On Twitter, the delightful author Laila Lalami [announced](http://lailalalami.com/the-moors-account/about/) that her historical novel [*The Moorâ€™s Account*](http://lailalalami.com/the-moors-account/about/) "is the recipient of an American Book Award." *Account* was also shortlisted for a Pulitzer this past year; you should probably read it, is my point.
