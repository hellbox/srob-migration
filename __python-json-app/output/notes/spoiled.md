To tell the truth, I have forgotten<br>
which year goes with what. 

My memory: as good as milk.<br>
My family: spoiled through 

and through. Pure as mold<br>
on a September nectarine, 

we refuse to announce defeat,<br>
death. In this house, the margins 

of mourning are tucked in,<br>
pleated to the neck. 

In August, my uncle dies<br>
and no one tells his children. 

He crosses his arms<br>
in a blue suit in a coffin 

where the ants<br>
want in. In December, 

my brother and I bundle up<br>
for a storm that goes 

through another town.<br>
What were we preparing for? 

My mother warns us:<br>
beware of well-lit places. 

Beware of fires burning<br> 
in the dark. If there is a spider 

under your cup,<br>
what will you do about it?
