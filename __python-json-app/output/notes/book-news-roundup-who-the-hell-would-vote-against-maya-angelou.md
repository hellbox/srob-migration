* The delightfully named [Gabrielle Bluestone at Gawker](http://gawker.com/the-shameful-google-results-for-the-nine-republicans-wh-1762397833) reports that nine House Republicans voted against naming a post office after the late poet Maya Angelou. Then Bluestone turns the tables on them:

<blockquote><p>“I think people should investigate Maya Angelou a little bit, and I’ll suggest perhaps if you want to investigate a little bit further that perhaps you Google ‘Maya Angelou’ and look at other articles in places like the American Thinker or the American Spectator,” Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Instead, we googled them.</p></blockquote>

This program is sort of a writer-in-residence deal for young Seattle authors, and it provides an opportunity for writers to get together in a group and discuss the creation of new work. Plus, you get all sorts of neat bonuses like access to Hugo House classes and the opportunity to take part in group readings. You can apply through the end of this month; find a link to the form [at the bottom of this page](https://hugohouse.org/get-involved/made-hugo-house/).

* In other application news, you have until April 1st to [apply for this year's Short Run Dash Grant](http://shortrunseattle.tumblr.com/post/140295701335/applications-for-short-runs-dash-grant-are-now?platform=hootsuite), which puts $250 in cash toward the creation of a comic to be premiered at this year's Short Run. The winner of the Dash Grant will also receive mentorship, free access to a silkscreen studio, a free half-table at Short Run, and your work will be on display at Fantagraphics Gallery in Georgetown. If you'd like to read a testimonial about the Dash Grant, we [interviewed the first Dash Grant winner, Krish Raghav](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/28/meet-short-runs-first-dash-grant-winner-krish-raghav/), last year.
