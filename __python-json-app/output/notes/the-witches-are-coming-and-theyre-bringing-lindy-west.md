<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1522977274777/Lindy%20West_150.jpeg)</p>Here's what Lindy West had to say on Facebook about her April 15 show at Benaroya Hall: *Huge news! I'm speaking at Benaroya Hall! All by myself! For a long time! WITH A HUMOROUS SLIDESHOW!*

Frankly, she had us at "I'm speaking"; by the end of that string of phrases, we were ready to see her twice. These are trying times, and they deserve to be skewered, as only Lindy West can. Get tickets [here](https://www.seattlesymphony.org/concerttickets/calendar/2017-2018/benaroyahall/lindy-west) or get more information [on our sponsorship page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships).
