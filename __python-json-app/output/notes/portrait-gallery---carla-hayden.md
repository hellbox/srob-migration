Carla Hayden is the 14th Librarian of Congress! But, more importantly, she's the first female and first black Librarian of Congress &mdash; the thirteen before her have all been white men. Also, she's actually a librarian (with a doctorate in library science from U Chicago), which hasn't been the case since the 70s. Hayden was the President of the American Library Association as well as the CEO of Enoch Pratt Free Library. She started her career at the Chicago Public Library, where the Obamas got to know and befriend her. [Read more](https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2016/16-110.html) about her history and achievements.
