My friend on the couch trembles.<br>
She’s crying because someone in her family

has died/is dying/is dead. She has stopped<br>
speaking in future tense and only says, _Now_.

The clock speaks in abstract sentences<br>
and she says, _We need more wine_.

A corner of her life is being rebuilt<br>
by a construction company she hasn’t approved.

A corner and her driveway is being paved.<br>
With gravestones. When she cries, I pour her

a glass of minor relief, another glass<br>
of lessen, and still one more of forgetting, a refill

of liquid assistance. _There are too many days_<br>
_to wait_, she says. And there are days

when the world’s veil is so thin, she feels God<br>
in the wind between the buildings.

She is almost mourning, but<br>
knows how close we all are

to being remembered. She is haunted<br>
by leaving, by the ones who already left,

all those doorways swinging open.<br>
_A breezeway to loss is where we are headed_

_no matter how hard we drag our feet_.<br>
She says she hates that she can’t stop wishing

for all of it to end, though sometimes in the blues<br>
of the curtain, she still sees _hope in hospice_.
