<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday October 5th: *Rolling Blackouts* Reading**</h5></p> 
With her ear for powerful, personal stories, new-to-Seattle cartoonist Sarah Glidden is the finest journalist to hit comics since Joe Sacco first put pen to paper. Her latest book, *Rolling Blackouts*, is a powerful piece of reportage that investigates what the Iraq War was like for ordinary people in the Middle East.  *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com .

At the *Seattle Review of Books*, we take conflicts of interest seriously. And so because I’m hosting the post-reading Q&A with Sarah Glidden at Elliott Bay Book Company, I also want to provide you with another option for a reading. And this is an important one: Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore’s new series featuring “Queer Writers in Conversation,” Contagious Exchanges, kicks off with incredible local author Rebecca Brown and artist C. Davida Ingram.

<h5>**Monday October 10th: *Last Look* Reading
**</h5></p> 
Brilliant cartoonist Charles Burns was born and raised here in Seattle, and his masterpiece, *Black Hole*, is a book that practically smells like the Pacific Northwest. Burns’s latest book, *Last Look*, collects his three most recent titles into one volume. It’s a riff on Tintin, teen angst, and the soul-twisting power of rock music.
