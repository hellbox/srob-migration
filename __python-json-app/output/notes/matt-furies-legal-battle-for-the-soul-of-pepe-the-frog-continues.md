Matthew Gault [at Motherboard writes](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8x8gaa/pepe-the-frogs-creator-lawsuits-dmca-matt-furie-alt-right):

<blockquote><p>Pepe the Frog creator Matt Furie has made good on his threat to "aggressively enforce his intellectual property."</p>

<p>The artist's lawyers have taken legal action against the alt-right. They have served cease and desist orders to several alt-right personalities and websites including Richard Spencer, Mike Cernovich, and the r/the_Donald subreddit. In addition, they have issued Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown requests to Reddit and Amazon, notifying them that use of Pepe by the alt-right on their platforms is copyright infringement. The message is to the alt-right is clearâ€”stop using Pepe the Frog or prepare for legal consequences.</p></blockquote>

Of course, the alt-right is fighting back, citing free speech. Nazis love to use the free speech defense. We'll see how that works out for them. Hopefully, [it will look something like this](https://media.giphy.com/media/iwRJ2OyBPjwkM/giphy.gif).
