<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday January 11th: Cat Rambo and Margaret Chiavetta**</h5></p> 
Two Seattle-based fantasy authors debut new work at Seattle’s best sci-fi bookstore. If you’ve been involved in our sci-fi community, you likely know Rambo’s name. Her newest book, *Neither Here Nor There*, is a collection of fantasy stories. You can see a tiny version of the nifty flip-cover format of the book right above this calendar entry. Chiavetta’s *Sir Duffy’s Promise* is the first in a new middle-reader fantasy series
 *University Book Store,  4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday January 12th: *Leaving the Planet* Opening Reception**</h5></p> 
Greg Stump’s deceptively simple comics are Seattle’s best-kept secret. From his early-2000s comic contributions to *The Stranger* to his magnum opus *Disillusioned Illusions*, Stump has been gradually stripping away all artifice to discover a kind of cartooning nirvana. Tonight, Stump kicks off his first non-comics art show with *Leaving the Planet*, an ink-and-watercolor extravaganza showcase.
 *Joe Bar, 810 E. Roy St., 324-0407. Free. All ages. 6 p.m.* 
 
<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday January 13th: *Indigenous London* Reading
**</h5></p> 
 Canadian history professor Coll Thrush, who wrote a terrific history of indigenous Seattle, returns with a book about the history of native peoples from America and New Zealand who traveled to the very center of the British Empire from the 16th century onward. This is a fascinating new twist on the study of colonialism.
*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m. * 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday January 14th: Bring on 2017!**</h5></p> 
Open Books, under the guidance of new owner Billie Swift, has been kicking ass with its reading series lately. The store kicks off a new year of literary events with a reading from four Seattle-area poets: Samar Abulhassan, Natasha Marin, Imani Sims, and Anastacia Renee Tolbert. Come join the party.
 *Open Books, 2414 N. 45th St., 633-0811, http://www.openpoetrybooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.* 

<h5>**Sunday January 15th: Writers Resist: A Celebration of Free Speech
**</h5></p> 
It seems impossible that this week will bring both the annual celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr. *and* Donald Trump’s inauguration. But here we are. To mentally prepare for the discord to come, why not attend this freedom-minded reading by writers from Bellingham (Robert Lashley) and Spokane (novelist Jess Walter, poet Tod Marshall) and Seattle (Elissa Washuta, Jane Wong, G. Willow Wilson)? 
 *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m. * 

<h5>**Monday January 16th: Something Special**</h5></p> 
The Egyptian Theatre is so beautiful and so welcoming that I’ve always thought it was kind of a shame that nobody ever hosted a reading there. Tonight, my dream comes true: Something Special is a multimedia celebration of short films, music (from Cosmos the Band) and spoken word (from Nikkita Oliver, Troy Osaki, and Leija Farr.) 
 *Egyptian Theatre, 805 E. Pine St., 324-9996, http://www.siff.net. $10. All ages. 9 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday January 17th: *Conflict Is Not Abuse* Reading **</h5></p>
