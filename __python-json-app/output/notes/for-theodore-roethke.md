The poet who was my teacher said we must rewrite.<br>
It was a warm afternoon. Sun dabbled in the greenhouse.<br>
So now I revise and revise until I think the real writing<br>
is rewriting. First drafts are small forays into the hills<br>
from which I bring back a pail half full of unripe<br>
blueberries that may, on closer look, be<br>
some other kind of fruit entirely. I remember<br>
he leaned back in the chair and waved his hand<br>
and said my poem describing salmon was really about sex.

<div class="break"></div>

We stood facing the faded paint of Parrington’s walls<br>
each Friday, memorizing lines of a poem we chose to recite &mdash;<br>
to learn the sound of the words together and the little spaces<br>
between the sounds. Each of us quaked.<br>
Inside the classroom he turned to the ravishing co-ed on his right,<br>
the one with the throaty voice and said,<br>
Play that for us on your bazooka, will you, honey?<br>
She nearly fainted but she spoke the lines.<br>
No one has ever made Louise Bogan sound like that.

<div class="break"></div>

He brought a straw hand basket belonging to his wife.<br>
It was stuffed with books. “She’ll kill me,“ he said,<br>
heaving it down on the table, the one who taught him<br>
Turn and Counter-Turn and Stand, who taught him Touch,<br>
that undulant white skin. We leaned to see what rivers<br>
might pour forth, what three-beat lines, what metaphysical<br>
poets hidden between the spines, what rose, what sorrow.<br>
Later, in my car beneath the flagpole, he said to kiss him on his cheek just once. In the rearview mirror, there she was.

<div class="break"></div>

Who, sitting in the tea house, doesn’t know he died too soon?<br>
Beyond the posts and beams, a roof of glass.<br>
the swimming pool is sculptured sand. Five rocks<br>
(the five-beat line?) mark where his breath last sighed<br>
to any bird: the anniversary of his death day.<br>
The last thing he said to me was,<br>
There’s going to be a special graduate class next fall<br>
and you’re in it. Years passed and one by one<br>
we learned he said that to all of us.
