<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday, December 19: Computer Science Book Club**</h5></p>
Ada’s Technical Books hosts a monthly Computer Science Book Club intended for people with and without computer science experience. This month’s selection is *How to Do Things with Videogames*, a book about “the limitless possibilities offered by [videogames’] ability to create complex simulated realities.” Sounds like this could be a good discussion about the theory and possibilities of videogames.
*Ada’s  Technical Books, 425 15th Ave, 322-1058, http://seattletechnicalbooks.com, 7 pm, free.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday, December 20: Storytime with Santa**</h5></p>

Bring your kid and your best camera for this combination storytime/photo opportunity at the Mill Creek branch of University Book Store. Santa Claus will be in attendance. Yes, the real one.
*University Book Store Mill Creek, 15311 Main St., 425-385-3530. http://ubookstore.com, 3 pm, free.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday, December 21: Literary Translator Feedback Forum**</h5></p>
The Northwest Translators and Interpreters Society continues its partnership with the downtown private library Folio with a Feedback forum. According to press materials, “Translators working on poetry or prose from three different languages will share their works in progress and accept helpful feedback and questions from attendees.” If you, like me, are fascinated by the fact that it’s virtually impossible to create anything resembling a truly 100% accurate translation, you’ll likely find a lot to think about at this event.
*Folio: The Seattle Athenaem, 324 Marion St., 402-4612, http://folioseattle.org, 5:30 pm, $5.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday, December 22: *Inside/Out* Reading**</h5></p>
This is a launch party for podcaster Joe Osmundson’s latest poetic memoir, *Inside/Out*. Garth Greenwell says the book “explores how vulnerability, need, and shame echo across a life, and meditates on the complexities, both emotional and ethical, of writing that life.”
*University Book Store,  4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/, 7 pm, free.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday, December 23: Storytime for Kids**</h5></p>
If you’re looking for ways to entertain your kids now that they’re out of school on winter break, now’s one of your last chances to attend a storytime before Christmas happens.
*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com, 11 am, free.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday, December 24: **</h5></p>
It’s Christmas Eve. Do something nice for yourself.
