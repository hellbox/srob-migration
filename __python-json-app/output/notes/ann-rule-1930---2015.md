KING 5 [is reporting](http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/seattle/2015/07/27/seattle-true-crime-writer-ann-rule-dies/30744985/) that local true crime writer Ann Rule has died. If you've never read *The Stranger Beside Me*, about Rule's personal relationship with serial killer Ted Bundy, you really should. It's far and away her best book, and a classic of the true crime genre.

I wrote a snarky overview of Rule's writing back when I was the new kid at *The Stranger*, and while I regret the tone of the piece — I was so much younger then! — I do not regret my opinion of Rule's work. Her writing was often a little florid, but she was an impeccable journalist, an expert interviewer, and a terrific researcher. She deserved better from me than the piece I delivered, and I'm not going to link to it here.

Rule demonstrated exactly how reporters should cover crime: with facts, with hundreds of pages of research backing you up, and with a ton of compassion for the victims and survivors of the crime. She never sold a victim out in exchange for a great story. She always listened to survivors, and gave them time and space to tell their stories. There aren't enough reporters like her left anymore. It's so sad that Rule's [last days were so difficult](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/21/ann-rule-sons-theft_n_7111854.html). She deserved better from the world after such a singular career and such an impressive body of work.
