To celebrate the paperback release of [his excellent novel *Lovecraft Country*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/caught-after-dark-in-lovecraft-country/), Seattle author [Matt Ruff](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/authors/matt-ruff/) is doing an AMA (that stands for "Ask Me Anything") [on Reddit right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5u0x3i/titleim_matt_ruff_author_of_lovecraft_country_bad/). (And if you're looking for inspiration for things to ask him, [here's my interview with Ruff from his book launch party last year](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/18/talking-with-matt-ruff-about-science-fictions-racist-past/).)
