Sponsor Northwest Associated Arts is bringing David Sedaris to the Broadway Performance Hall for eight performances over seven days. It's the second ("second annual"? dare we hope?) time Sedaris has put on this event: a week-long series of readings to workshop his newest project. This year, the book is *Calypso*, a collection of essays that won't come out until summer. Seattle: you know how far away summer is. Don't miss this chance for a preview.

There’s more information [on our sponsor’s page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/), or you can buy tickets [here](http://sedaris.strangertickets.com). Act now; two of the dates are already sold out, and last year they went faster than hotcakes.

Many thanks to Northwest Associated Arts for sponsoring the site this week. If you're interested in doing the same — and putting your book or event in front of our readers, while supporting some of the best writing about books in the city — check out [available dates in 2018](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/). Like Sedaris, we sell out quickly, so make sure you're on the calendar now.
