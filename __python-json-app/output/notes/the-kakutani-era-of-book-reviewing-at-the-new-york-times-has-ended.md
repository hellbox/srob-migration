Joe Pompeo [at *Vanity Fair*](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/michiko-kakutani-leaving-the-new-york-times):

<blockquote>*Vanity Fair* has learned that Michiko Kakutani, The *New York Times* chief book reviewer and Pulitzer Prize winner, who has been, by a wide margin, the most powerful book critic in the English-speaking world, is stepping down. Her final review, on the debut novel by Nigerian author Ayobami Adebayo, was published on Tuesday.</blockquote>

I'll likely have more thoughts on this at a later date, but here's my first impression: even people who don't typically read book reviews in the *New York Times* — here, I raise my hand meekly — have to acknowledge that this is a big deal for American literature. Kakutani is the closest thing to a household name that the book reviewing world has. The next person to take her position will enjoy a tremendous opportunity to represent literary criticism to the general public. Hopefully, the next editor will lead book reviewing into the 21st century with creativity and enthusiasm.

**UPDATE 10:17 AM**: This post has been updated because I believed some idiot on Twitter about Kakutani's replacement. Sorry about that. I'll try not to believe Twitter randos without double-sourcing next time. No replacement for Kakutani has been named, though critic [Parul Seghal](https://twitter.com/parul_sehgal) has been [elevated from *NYT Book Review* senior editor to a critic position](http://www.nytco.com/michiko-kakutani-steps-down-as-chief-book-critic-parul-sehgal-named-book-critic/) at the daily *Times*.
