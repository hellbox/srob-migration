This note was just posted on Roosevelt bar/coffee shop [Café Racer's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/CafeRacerSeattle/posts/10159439433700402):

<blockquote><p class="noindent">It is with great sadness that I have to say this...</p>

<p class="noindent">Café Racer is closing.</p>

<p class="noindent">The last night will be this Wednesday.</p>

<p class="noindent">Lord knows the café has had it's ups and downs but it has been 14 years of art and music and community. No one can take that away from us.</p>

<p class="noindent">But I just can no longer support it. It is still for sale, and I've had some offers, who wanted to carry on what the café is, but for one reason or another, they have falling through. Contact me if you are interested because the last thing I want is for the café to go away.</p>

<p class="noindent">I'm sorry. This is the last thing that I wanted to happen.</p>

<p class="noindent">Love,</p>
<p class="noindent">Kurt</p></blockquote>

Presumably the "Kurt" in question is Racer owner Kurt Geissel. Geissel announced his intentions to sell Racer [back in the spring of this year](http://www.king5.com/news/local/seattle/after-12-years-owner-puts-caf-racer-up-for-sale/422664518).

Café Racer has long been a home base for Seattle's cartooning community, perhaps most notably as the home for the [Dune Night comics/zine-drawing jam session](http://www.cityartsonline.com/articles/dune-zine-and-drawing-jam-cafe-racer). It has also been home to readings, writing workshops, and countless folks working on their novels. The city is losing a literary hub this Wednesday.
