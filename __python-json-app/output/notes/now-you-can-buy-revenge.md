If you, like tens of thousands of others, loved [Elisa Chavez's poem "Revenge" when it appeared on the *Seattle Review of Books* in January](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/01/03/revenge/), you should know that a broadside of the poem is [now available on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/523725611/letterpress-broadside-revenge-by-elisa). It costs $35, and all proceeds benefit the [International Rescue Committee](https://www.rescue.org/). It looks absolutely gorgeous, too.
