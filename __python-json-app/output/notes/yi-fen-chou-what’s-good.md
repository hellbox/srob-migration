Of all the think-pieces published yesterday about [Sherman Alexie and the *Best American Poetry*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/08/so-did-i-pick-the-best-75-poems-published-last-year-of-course-not-i-picked-75-poems-that-survived-a-literary-ordeal-that-happened-only-in-my-brain/) controversy, [Jia Tolentino's piece at Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/if-youre-a-white-man-who-cant-get-published-under-your-1729280567) is by far the best. Don't bother with the rest of them. This has been a think-piece public service announcement.
