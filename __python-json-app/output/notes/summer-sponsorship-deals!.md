We [just released our Sept 2017 - January 2018 sponorship openings](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/07/03/sponsorships-now-open-through-january-2018/), and they've sold faster then ever. Of that block, only [~~three~~ _two_ dates](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/) remain available, in November and December. Thank you, sponsors!

But we still have a few dates left this Summer &mdash; one next week, and also a few in August. We've just marked those down, so if you're looking for a sponsorship deal, head over to our [booking page and snap up the date you'd like](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/) before someone else does. 

Your sponsorship gets you in front of Seattle's most passionate readers, and  your money goes to hire the writers and keep the site running. It's a virtuous cycle, and we couldn't do it without you. [Come on board](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/), and be part of the team that keeps our community growing.
