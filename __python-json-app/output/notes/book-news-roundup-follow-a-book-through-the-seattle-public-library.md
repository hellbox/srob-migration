* Speaking of librarians, I just want to make sure that you appreciate how [librarians dragged Ivanka Trump](https://consumerist.com/2017/04/14/librarians-to-ivanka-trump-if-you-support-libraries-why-is-your-dad-trying-to-defund-them/) for her all-talk "support" of public libraries at the same time that her dad is trying to defund them.

* The good people at Artist Trust are [launching a "Night School" program of short classes](http://artisttrust.org/index.php/news/blogpost/art_business_night_school_is_open_for_registration) for artists. Classes include "[Promotion Fundamentals](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2922148)" and "[Business Fundamentals](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2922190)."

* Open Culture published [a neat look at what children's books were like in the Soviet Union](http://www.openculture.com/2017/04/read-vladimir-mayakovskys-childrens-book-whom-should-i-be.html).
