**MONDAY**: Elliott Bay Book Company hosts *Seattle Times* reporter James Neff, who debuts his new historical account, *Vendetta: Bobby Kennedy Versus Jimmy Hoffa*. This one’s got some good blurbs. Seymour Hersh says, “This is not a book about a good Bobby versus a bad Hoffa. It is a study of two men who always got what they wanted staging a shootout on the streets of Laredo. And, as Neff tells it, there were no winners.” And Erik Larson — *Devil in the White City* Erik Larson — calls it “a triumph of investigation and revelation.” That makes it well worth your time.

**TUESDAY**: Might as well have a pajama party in Elliott Bay Book Company all night Monday night, because they’ve got the best reading of Tuesday, too. Lidia Yukanvitch, the brilliant Portland author of *Dora: A Headcase*, reads from her new novel, *The Small Backs of Children*. 

**WEDNESDAY**: Ada’s Technical Books hosts a comic book reading with Anders Nilsen and Marc Bell. Bell presents his first “full-length graphic novella,” which seems like a weird designation — what is the fullest length a graphic novella can reach without hitting novel-size? For that matter, what’s the official size of a graphic novel? Anyway, in *Stroppy*, the protagonist “hopes to win big in a songwriting contest organized by the All-Star Schnauzer Band.” Nilsen, who has made some great comics including the terrific Charles Schulz-meets-Tolstoy bird epic *Big Questions*, celebrates the publication of a new collection of his sketchbooks. It’s titled *Poetry Is Useless*, which is a great title.

**THURSDAY**:  Up at Ravenna Third Place, Jody Bower reads from her book *Jane Eyre's Sisters*, which “argues that Joseph Campbell's model of the hero's journey does not work for women.” Instead, Bower thinks books about female heroes “need a different model to do justice to a woman's experience of moving beyond the expectations of conventional societal roles to find her true, creative self.” This is a fascinating argument.

**FRIDAY**: Back to Elliott Bay Book Company for a reading from Scott Dodson, who’ll read from his book *The Legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg*. Dodson’s book couldn’t be any better timed, now that the Notorious RGB has become a style icon.

**SATURDAY**: No events today. You should probably set the day aside to either read *Go Set a Watchman*, which was released on Tuesday or — my preference — re-read *To Kill a Mockingbird*, instead.

**SUNDAY**: No readings today, either. It’s summer! Go read a book in the park. Recommend a book to a friend, and ask for a recommendation in return. Bury your face in the pages of a book and waggle your face around for a while.
