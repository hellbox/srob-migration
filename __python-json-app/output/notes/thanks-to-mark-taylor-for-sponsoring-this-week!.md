Our thanks to sponsor Mark Taylor -- have you [looked yet at the](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) chapter from his work _Assassin Rabbit From the Dawn of Time_? 

Mark is getting ready to release the ebook version soon, and we added a handy-dandy email signup form [on the page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) allows you to add your name to his email list lickity-split, so you'll know when that happens. 

Of course, it's all part of our campaign to make [internet advertising 100% less terrible](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/). Check out Mark's work, put your email down to signup for his list, and consider buying the book -- we've enjoyed having him as a sponsor.
