Our thanks to this week's sponsor Darin Bradley. One reviewer said this about his novel _Chimpanzee_ “So if you took _Twelve Monkeys_, add _The Time Traveler’s Wife_ but subtract the time-travel, multiply by 1984, factor in _Strange Days_ and divide by _Fight Club_, you get _Chimpanzee_.”

_The Seattle Review of Books_ relies on sponorships to bring you poems, interviews, reviews, notes, and advice every week. Go read a chapter from [_Chimpanzee_](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships), and if you like it, consider picking up a copy and telling him you heard about it hear. It's all part of our [campaign to make internet advertising better](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/).
