A [couple months ago](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/12/aprils-throwing-a-writing-contest-and-youre-invited/), the APRIL Festival announced a writing contest, with the winner receiving $100, the publication of their piece right here on the *Seattle Review of Books*, and a reading slot in the 2016 festival.

Today, [APRIL announced](https://www.facebook.com/APRILFestival/posts/1203721599657226) that the winner of their contest is Jessica Mooney, who [you can follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jessleimoon) right now. *SRoB* cofounder Martin McClellan and I chose the winning entry, and it took a lot of deliberation. The entries were all so good, but Mooney's "Love Canal" was, in the end, a unanimous favorite.

We're very excited for you to read this piece of writing in the spring, and we're also excited to hear Mooney read it in this year's festival. Thanks to everyone who participated, and thanks for APRIL for asking us to take part in this contest.
