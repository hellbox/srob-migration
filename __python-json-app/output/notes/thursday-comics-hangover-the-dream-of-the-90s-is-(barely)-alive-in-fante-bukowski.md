In the 1990s, a ton of male cartoonists made their careers by writing stories about schlubby men with huge egos. These self-important losers — from Buddy Bradley to Adrian Tomine's protagonists to Ivan Brunetti's self-portrayal — were important at the time: they poked necessary holes in the idea that the only stories worth telling were stories about straight white men of a certain age.

Cartoonist Noah Van Sciver's newest book, *Fante Bukowski Two*, seems to desperately want to be from the 1990s. It's designed to look like the Black Sparrow edition of Charles Bukowski's *Factotum*, and it has a completely realistic facsimile of a Borders price sticker on the back cover. 

And the content of the book, too, feels ripped from the 1990s. It's a book about a bearded loser who believes himself to be the next Outlaw American Novelist, but who is in fact a talentless hack. Bukowski drinks too much, he lives on donations from his too-tolerant parents, he refuses to get a job. In this book, he lives in a flophouse and makes tons of zines and fails to sell copies all around town.

But the question that Van Sciver fails to answer is: who is this book for? Do we really need another book that skewers bloviating mediocre literary white men? *Bukowski* feels from the start like the alternative comics from the 1990s, and it never really stops wallowing in nostalgia for that era.

To be fair, Van Sciver is a talented cartoonist, and he has a great sense of comic timing. Parts of *Fante Bukowski 2* are very funny. But I expect more than “funny” from a Fantagraphics title — the Seattle publisher has such a stellar publication history that I expect some sort of a point from all their books. Unfortunately, *Bukowski* feels like an exquisitely crafted fan fiction tribute to Fantagraphics titles from a bygone era.

And this question might seem petty, but it’s actually quite important: Do people like the person this book is supposedly satirizing even *exist* anymore? Do Bukowski acolytes still talk about the authentic human experience and produce zines to distribute at open mic nights? To me, this feels like a time-capsule, a skewering that arrives twenty years too late.

This is not to say that Van Sciver shouldn’t satirize white men, or that white men aren’t a relevant target anymore; quite the contrary. We live in a time in which [mobs of bored white dudes are starting riots](https://la.eater.com/2017/10/9/16448332/mcdonalds-mulan-szechwan-sauce-rick-morty-riot-police) because their preferred flavor of corn syrup isn’t available at their local McDonald’s. If the self-entitled jackass star of *Bukowski* were alive today, his obsessions and behavior would likely be very different. With its obsessive backwards stare, *Bukowski* feels stale and hopelessly retro.
