Sponsor Isla McKetta spent a year in Poland, and it was that experience, and having spent a previous year in Pinochet's Chile as a child, that made oppression a topic in the forefront of her mind. In her novel _Polska, 1994_ she explores that, through the eyes of Magda, who witnesses her mother's arrest and disapearance. 

We have a long sample [on our sponsor's page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) so you can experience McKetta's tightly wrought language and ideas. See the world of this girl and how the country, and family, she's born into define her struggles.
