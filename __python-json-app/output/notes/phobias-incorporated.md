Father Giuliano, the drama instructor, fainted<br>
every time he saw blood.<br>
When a nun in the class, newly acquainted<br>
with stagecraft,<br>
fed a hand to the band saw, Giuliano was the one<br>
who had to be treated. My mother<br>
applauded the hero.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the first clap of thunder,<br>
she ran to the bureau for the rosary.<br>
All through a stormy upbringing<br>
under the kitchen sink after dark,<br>
I repeated my lines. No wonder I link priest and parent,<br>
twins in a Siamese startlement: Blood and Thunder,<br>
Thunder and Blood. _Pray for us&hellip;<br>
at the hour of death_.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real drama begins with<br>
a thud &mdash; my sister &mdash; not claustrophobic, not<br>
acrophobic, plunging from bed,<br>
riding the nightmare bedrails. Her elevator shaft<br>
endangered us all, marked women,<br>
dumb waiters adrift on a sunken _Titanic_. Days<br>
I rode up and down, wherever the tenants were going<br>
for fun, not pushing the panic button.<br> 
I was afraid of cats. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a circular story<br>
and that's where I leave it: the Siamese leap<br>
sucking breath, old wives'<br>
tales, the alley cats my sister brought home<br>
sheltered from storm,<br>
early death of a hero and always<br>
the drawn blood informing<br>
our several lives.
