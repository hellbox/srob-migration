<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday May 31st: *One Day We’ll All Be Dead and None of This Will Matter* Reading**</h5></p> 
Scaachi Koul writes about culture for BuzzFeed. Her new, much-chatted-about collection of comic essays is about growing up in an Indian-Canadian family. Tonight, she’ll be in conversation with Seattle’s own Lindy West, who, as you may have heard, knows a thing or two about comedic essays. 
*Seattle Public Library, 1000 4th Ave., 386-4636, http://spl.org. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.* 
 
 <p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday June 1st: Interrupting Whiteness**</h5></p>
The whole idea of PechaKucha is that speakers simultaneously talk and show twenty slides for twenty seconds each. It’s a fun high-wire act of a public speaking spectacle. Tonight’s event is all about investigating the question of being white as it pertains to privilege, injustice, outreach, and responsibility.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday June 2nd: *Volcano* Reading**</h5></p> 
Neil Matheson will discuss how geography affects the way we puny humans live our lives. We celebrate when we can see Mount Rainier on sunny days, for example, but beneath that celebration, there’s also an understanding that the mountain could, in theory, kill us all at any moment.
*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave., 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday June 3rd: *The Inheritance of Shame* Reading**</h5></p> 
As a child, Peter Gajdics lived through six long years of a psychiatrist’s attempts to “convert” him from gay to straight. His memoir is about coming through so-called conversion therapy and learning how to love yourself after being exposed to so much rigorous, institutionalized hatred. (Reminder: Mike Pence still thinks conversion therapy is a good idea.)

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday June 4th: Memoir Class Dismissed**</h5></p> 
Memoirist Theo Pauline Nestor regularly teaches a yearlong memoir manuscript-writing class at Hugo House. This afternoon, her 2016–17 class will discuss what they’ve learned and share some writing they composed over the course of the class. If you’ve ever considered writing a memoir, you should check this out. 
*Hugo House, 1021 Columbia St., 322-7030, http://hugohouse.org. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday June 5th: *Upstream* Reading**</h5></p> 
Northwest author Langdon Cook has written at length about mushrooms. Now he’s turning his eye to another regional staple: salmon. (Press materials call salmon “perhaps the last great wild food.”) His new book is about the history of humanity’s relationship to salmon and the environmental impact that the salmon industry has had on the land.
