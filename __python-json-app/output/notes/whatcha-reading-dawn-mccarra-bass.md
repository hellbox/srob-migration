Dawn McCarra Bass is the Associate Editor of the _Seattle Review of Books_, as well as a voracious reader and writer. It was fun to hear what she picks up when she's not editing reviews and reading all those long internet articles for the [Sunday Post](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-sunday-post).

<p class="noindent">**What are you reading now?**</p>

<p class="noindent">I just started [*Descender*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781632154262?aff=hellbox), by <a href="http://jefflemire.blogspot.com/" title="Jeff Lemire&#x27;s Blog">Jeff Lemire</a> and <a href="http://duss005.com/" title="duss005.com">Dustin Nguyen</a>. I've been collecting single issues unread since April 2015, apparently. (I have a bad habit of hoarding books I expect will be good &mdash; against, I guess, some downturn in fortune when I'll need them. *Book of Dust*, *Acceptance*, I'm looking at you.)</p>

<p>I am batshit, batshit crazy about Jeff Lemire; he does loneliness and desolation with exceptional clarity and grace. He doesn&#8217;t push self-pity on his characters or ask the reader to feel pity for them &mdash; just reminds you how human it is to be lost &mdash; whether he&#8217;s writing about an over-the-hill hockey player or, in this case, a little boy who&#8217;s an android. And the art by Nguyen is gorgeous, utterly signature to the series and yet infinitely adaptable to its moods. </p>

<p class="noindent">**What did you read last?**</p>

<p class="noindent">[*Lolas' House*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780810135864?aff=hellbox), by M. Evelina Galang, which captures the stories of a group of Filipino women who were held in Japanese rape camps during World War II. It went on my list while I was working on [Donna Miscolta's review](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-language-of-justice/) and finally made it to the top. It's a hard book to read; I did it in two days, then had a hangover for a week. But it's brilliantly done. Galang intersperses testimonials from the lolas, grandmother-aged women who were anywhere from 12 to 24 when they were abducted, with her own emotional and physical experience both of knowing the women and of re-living their stories with them. Were you inclined to intellectualize, she refuses to let you do it, you have to live it right along with her.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not always able to read the books our freelancers cover, but I like to when I can. Our writers are fucking amazing, and their perspectives are so interesting that I can&#8217;t resist going to see for myself.</p>

<p class="noindent">**What are you reading next?**</p>

<p class="noindent">_I wish I knew._ I have two books sitting next to me right now, and one of them is wrapped up in brown paper with a "Phinney by Post" stamp on it &mdash; the first of the year. The other is [_The Correspondence_](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780374537425?aff=hellbox), by J. D. Daniels, picked after a bit of browsing because it looked like it might fit one of my favorite categories: small, personal, surprising books. Physical format, book design, and guesswork . . . It's how I came across Maggie Nelson's [*Bluets*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781933517407?aff=hellbox), Sarah Manguso's [*Ongoingness: The End of a Diary*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781555977030?aff=hellbox), Denis Johnson's [*Train Dreams*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250007650?aff=hellbox), Scott McClanahan's [*The Sarah Book*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780988518391?aff=hellbox). Also incredible curation by booksellers, of course, who I'm pretty sure "force" them off the shelves like cardsharps.</p>
