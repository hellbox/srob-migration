Over at [the Theatrical Mustang podcast](http://theatricalmustang.podbean.com/e/paul-constant/), I talked about the *Seattle Review of Books* with host Katie Woodzick. We also discussed diversity, why Seattle is such an amazing city for books, and the pleasure of not discussing Jonathan Franzen. I hope you'll give it a listen and then subscribe to Theatrical Mustang, which interviews all sorts of literary, theater, and musical types. Start with [this interview with the wonderful Kathy Hsieh](http://theatricalmustang.podbean.com/e/kathy-hsieh/).
