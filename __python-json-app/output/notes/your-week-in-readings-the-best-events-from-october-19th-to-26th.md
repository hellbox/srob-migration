**MONDAY** Start the week off with some librarians at a [Bookish Happy Hour at the Diller Room](https://www.facebook.com/events/1501246780167954/). This is part of Seattle Public Library’s Booktoberfest program, which brings librarians, beer, and you together in non-traditional venues.

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1445196439733/Freemans.jpg)</p>**TUESDAY** I’ve been looking forward to this for months now: [at the Seattle Public Library](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/colum-mccann-john-freeman-paul-constant-seattle-public-library), I’m participating in an event with **Colum McCann and John Freeman**. McCann, of course, is a beloved novelist who manages to span that widest of chasms: he writes — gasp! — bestselling literary fiction. His newest collection is titled *Thirteen Ways of Looking*, and it contains a novella and three short stories, touching on security and our modern panopticon of a society and also heartbreak, because you can’t have a McCann story without heartbreak. Freeman is well-known in the publishing industry: he was editor at *Granta*, he’s a noteworthy literary critic (which makes him as rare as mermaid’s tears), and now he’s starting a new magazine called *Freeman’s*, which presents new work based on a theme. The first issue is centered around the idea of “Arrival,” and it features talent like McCann, Haruki Murakami, Louise Erdrich, and Dave Eggers. This is an explosive debut for a literary magazine, and this event should be a lot of fun.

But of course, because I’m involved in that event, I’m naturally biased. So allow me to present an **ALTERNATE TUESDAY** event for your edification. At [Town Hall Seattle](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=10&evyear=2015&eventid=2015062217553100&pre=20151012&pst=20151028), **Jack Nisbet** will appear in conversation with **John Marzluff**, a professor of wildlife science, and geologist **David Montgomery**. Nisbet’s newest book *Ancient Places* explores the relationship between the landscape and the culture of the Pacific Northwest,.

**WEDNESDAY** The WordsWest Literary Series will happen [at C&P Coffee Company in West Seattle](http://wordswestliterary.weebly.com/). This is a monthly reading series that brings new and established talent to a neighborhood that doesn’t see very many literary events. Tonight’s readers are KUOW journalist **Ruby de Luna**, who has reported on immigrant communities and health care, and **Stephanie Timm**, an author who recently wrote a play titled *Tails of Wasps* and co-authored an adaptation of *The Ramayana* with Yussef el Guindi.

**THURSDAY** Obviously, you’re going to [Lit Crawl Seattle](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/). This is not optional.

**FRIDAY** [Elliott Bay Book Company](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/joe-meno-nina-revoyr) hosts two novelists who have been published by the wonderful publisher Akashic Books. **Joe Meno** will read from his new novel, *Marvel and a Wonder*, which is about a farm, horse-racing, and family. **Nina Revoyr**’s new novel  *Lost Canyon* is about four backpackers who go on a trip that finds them outside of their comfort zone.

**SATURDAY** [University Book Store](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=10&evyear=2015&eventid=2015091813464500) presents a special reading with Seattle author **G. Willow Wilson** and writer **Margaret Stohl**. They’ll be signing their new books: Wilson’s latest comic is  *A-Force*, which features an all-woman team of superheroes, and  Stohl recently published a young adult novel starring the Marvel character Black Widow. While mainstream comics is slowly opening up to women, it’s still a predominantly male-dominated field. This is a rare chance to meet and talk with two women who have made names for themselves and thrived in that industry. Go show them some love.

**SUNDAY** [Hugo House](http://hugohouse.org/event/floating-bridge-press-chapbook-winners/) hosts a reading from Floating Bridge Press chapbook winners. Every year, great local publisher Floating Bridge Press sponsors a contest that finds a new poet and publishes their work. This year’s winner is **Michael Schmeltzer**, who will read from his chapbook,  *Elegy/Elk River*. (He’s also got a book coming out soon from Two Sylvias Press.)  Several finalists from the contest— **Maya Jewell Zeller, Brian Cooney, and Linda Malnack** — will also read. This is a great chance to see some new poets do their thing; you’ll likely be seeing these names around town for years to come. Why not get a head start tonight?
