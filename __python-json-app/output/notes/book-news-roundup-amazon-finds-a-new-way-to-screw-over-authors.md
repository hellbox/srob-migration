* The *Seattle Weekly*'s Mark Baumgarten [talks with David Brewster](http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/962709-129/on-the-eve-of-his-latest) about his Seattle atheneum, Folio. I [wrote about Folio last fall](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/24/opening-the-folio/), and it's now open to the public. If you're wondering whether a paid library/coworking space is right for you, you should drop by and take a look. It's on Marion Street, between 3rd Ave and 4th Ave downtown.

* VIDA updated their [excellent list of presses run by women](http://www.vidaweb.org/list-of-women-run-presses/) this week. Women still don't possess an equal share of high-profile positions in the pubishing industry; supporting these presses is a way to help correct that imbalance.

* The people behind popular narrative horror/comedy podcast *Welcome to Night Vale* are branching out by launching a podcasting platform, [reports the *New York Times*](http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/night-vale-creators-to-start-new-podcast-platform/?emc=edit_tnt_20160121&nlid=65389624&tntemail0=y&_r=0). They hope to experiment with longform serialized fiction podcasts, which sounds like a great idea.

* Newspapers are dying. [No, really](https://medium.com/@dicktofel/the-sky-is-falling-on-print-newspapers-faster-than-you-think-c84a2f9a9df4#.4ug850m54). 

* Graphic novel sales in bookstores [increased by 22 percent](http://www.comicsbeat.com/graphic-novel-sales-up-22-in-bookstores-in-2015/) last year.

* We've been hearing from a lot of self-published authors who are upset with Amazon lately. Author [A.M. Madden has published an open letter](http://ammadden.com/dear-amazon/) to Amazon on her blog that lists the majority of these complaints: basically, Amazon keeps changing the rules on their self-published authors. These changes result in huge financial losses for the writers, who are locked into Amazon's ecosystem and are, therefore basically powerless. "My fans have increased, and I now have nine books published instead of just three, yet in 2015, I made **less than half in royalties that I made in 2014**," Madden writes.
