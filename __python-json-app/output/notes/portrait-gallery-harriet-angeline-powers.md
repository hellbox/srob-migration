<p class="noindent">Today's the birthday of American folk-artist and quilter [Harriet Angeline Powers](http://www.earlywomenmasters.net/powers/), born October 29, 1837, the "mother of African-American quilting." Her story quilts depict bible stories and astronomical events in striking graphic panels. Two quilts have survived and are on display at the Smithsonian and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston:</p>

* [Bible Quilt 1885-1886 (Smithsonian Institute American History Collection)](http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_556462)
* [Pictorial Quilt 1895-1898 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)](http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/pictorial-quilt-116166)
