_&mdash; it’s 1962 March 28th_

it’s 2017 September 19th.<br> 
I’m sitting at the window on the 3rd floor of fog.<br> 
Day is rising.<br> 
I never knew I liked<br> 
morning lifting like a conductor’s baton.

I didn’t know I loved my body.<br> 
Can someone who hates their body love it.<br> 
I’ve always schemed against my body.<br> 
It’s just like all my other lovers. 

I’ve loved long roads all my life &mdash; the flat<br> 
macadam itself listening under the mist of lamps, no traffic at the<br> 
hour. I know that road is both obscured and obvious.<br> 
I know its lights aren’t enough to see &mdash;

I love to close my eyes and look at your eyes<br> 
and see if your eyes are still closed.
