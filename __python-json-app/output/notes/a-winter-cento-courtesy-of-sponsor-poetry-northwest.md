If you haven't picked up the winter/spring 2018 issue of *Poetry Northwest*, get to it: it's waiting in the magazine stand at your local independent bookstore. Every issue has a theme, and this time around it's visual poetry. *Poetry Northwest* always has a strong graphic element — the look of the publication gets more interesting with every issue — so we're excited to get our eyes on the pages of this one.  As part of their sponsorship of the site, the journal's sharing a couple of gorgeous inside peeks with our readers: stop by [our sponsorship page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorship/) to check it out, then [subscribe](https://www.poetrynw.org/subscribe/) to make sure you don't miss the next issue.
