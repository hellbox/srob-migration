Time was, you just had to keep your eye on a few New York publications in order to see if there was any new writing from the top authors in the country. Now, thankfully, there are infinitely more outlets available. Case in point: earlier this month, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie published a great essay about the state of feminism on her Facebook page, and it's slowly been making the rounds ever since. It's kind of a bomb-throwing piece:

<blockquote>Beware the danger of what I call Feminism Lite. It is the idea of conditional female equality. Reject this entirely. It is a hollow, appeasing, and bankrupt idea. Being a feminist is like being pregnant. You either are or you are not. You either believe in the full equality of women, or you do not.</blockquote>

I recommend you go [read the whole thing](https://www.facebook.com/chimamandaadichie/posts/10154412708460944).
