Now is the time to [apply for the Clarion West summer workshop](http://www.clarionwest.org/workshops/summer/apply/). Yes, it does cost money to apply (though it costs less to apply now than it will cost later on) but Clarion West is maybe the best education organization in America for aspiring sci-fi and fantasy writers. And [their mission statement](http://www.clarionwest.org/about/) is so goddamned good:

<blockquote>Speculative fiction — science fiction, fantasy, horror, magic realism, and slipstream — gives voice to those who explore societal and technological change, along with deeper considerations of underlying archetypes of human experience. Although there are fine science fiction and fantasy writers of all ethnicities, races, and genders, historically the field has reflected the same prejudices found in the culture around it, leading to proportionately fewer successful writers of color and women writers than white male writers. Within the limitations of the workshop, Clarion West is dedicated to improving those proportions.</blockquote>

They do offer scholarships, too. If you're interested in being a writer of speculative fiction, this could be the best investment you'll ever make.
