<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday, March 25:  King-Snohomish County Regional Spelling Bee **</h5></p>
Exciting! Some 90 middle-schoolers join in M-O-R-T-A-L C-O-M-B-A-T to determine who is the best speller in the region. The winner will go on to face the best spellers in the country. I took part in a spelling bee in elementary school; I went on to regionals and then I lost because I spelled "VENEER" "V-E-N-I-E-R." I guarantee that several of these kids are going to remember the words they lost on for the rest of their lives, too.
