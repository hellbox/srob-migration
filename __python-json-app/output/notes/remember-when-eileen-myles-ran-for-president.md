No? I don't either, but that's okay. [Joanna Rothkopf at Jezebel](http://theslot.jezebel.com/a-look-back-at-eileen-myles-revolutionary-openly-femal-1752734234) has written a great look back at 1991, when one of [our greatest living poets](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/sorry-eileen-myles/) decided to run for president as the only "openly female" candidate.
