* Congratulations to Tim Lennon, who [was announced as](http://artbeat.seattle.gov/2017/11/13/first-executive-director-of-langston-hired/) the Executive Director of LANGSTON, a new Seattle nonprofit that will "guide programming intended to strengthen and advance community through Black arts and culture." I worked with Lennon at Elliott Bay Book Company right after he moved to town in 2001 and we've been friends ever since, so I can't claim any objectivity, but his career in the years since — at One Reel, heading up Vera Project, working at the Office of Arts & Culture — demonstrates that he'll be excellent at this. I look forward to seeing what LANGSTON contributes to Seattle's arts and literary communities. Lennon starts in January of next year. And if this post didn't have enough conflict-of-interest in it for you already, the best account in local media of Lennon's new job is [from my old associate Brendan Kiley at the *Seattle Times*](https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/theater/a-new-leader-for-langston-tim-lennon/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_brendan-kiley).

* [*Kirkus* interviewed Chin Music Press editor Cali Kopczick](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/cali-kopczick-chin-music-press/) about the trends she's spotted in publishing, what manuscripts she'd never like to see again, and what's unique about Seattle's Chin Music.

* Yesterday, Amazon's television division [paid a crazy amount of money](http://deadline.com/2017/11/amazon-the-lord-of-the-rings-tv-series-multi-season-commitment-1202207065/) to make a Lord of the Rings prequel TV show. There's not much information about this, but the deal is so huge that it seems to be tempting fate:

<blockquote>In its quest to launch a hit fantasy series of the Game of Thrones caliber, Amazon has closed a massive deal — said to be close to $250 million — to acquire global TV rights to The Lord of the Rings, based on the fantasy novels by J.R.R. Tolkien. The streaming service has given a multi-season commitment to a LOTR series in the pact, which also includes a potential spinoff series.</blockquote>

* I dunno about you, but when I see a quarter-of-a-billion deal with multi-season franchise commitments, I think of the [recent collapse of Universal's awful "Dark Universe" megafranchise](https://newswire.net/newsroom/news/00098592-universal-s-dark-universe-cancelled.html), and then I think of an old cliche about counting baby chicks before they hatch. And then I think of all the people living under bridges in this city and I start to feel queasy.

* The comics industry is going through its own sexual harassment crisis, and [Heidi MacDonald at the Beat](http://www.comicsbeat.com/the-week-in-harassment-news-and-analysis/) has been keeping good track of it all. Hopefully when we get to the other side of all this and the predators have been shaken out, we'll see a more inclusive, less white-male-centric comics industry.

* And if you think the children's book industry is free from sexual harassment, you should read this thread: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two Fridays ago I met up with a man who works at a children&#39;s publishing company to discuss making a book together in which he tried to manipulate me into having sex with him. I reported him to HR. Been waiting to see if they actually handle this and how.</p>&mdash; Charlyne Yi (@charlyne_yi) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlyne_yi/status/930478085027258368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2017</a></blockquote>

* Book sales [declined slightly last quarter](https://lunch.publishersmarketplace.com/2017/11/tracked-book-sales-slightly-q3/). Personally, I blame Trump.
