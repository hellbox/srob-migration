<p class="noindent">This week's glimpse between the covers of an upcoming book is courtesy of sponsor and local author Elizabeth C. Fowler. Fowler grew up in Australia as a Hungarian refugee, then immigrated to Seattle with her family, facing the challenge of discrimination on one continent and integration on the other. How she got from there to here — and grew from a lonely young girl into a talented physician with a passionate love for music and nature — is a story worth reading. And you can do just that, or at least get a taste; she's generously provided a full chapter of her memoir, *Lonely Refugee*, just for *Seattle Review of Books* readers.</p>
