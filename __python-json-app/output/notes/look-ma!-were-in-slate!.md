Many thanks to [Ruth Graham at *Slate*](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2017/06/donald_trump_inspires_a_surge_in_book_clubs.html) for citing our book club as the first example in her article about reading and resistance in the age of Trump:

<blockquote>Some independent bookstores, progressive media outlets, and activist groups have launched new clubs to meet the moment. In Seattle there’s “Reading Through It: A Post-Election Book Club.” (First selection: J.D. Vance’s [*Hillbilly Elegy*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/12/08/thank-you-for-coming-to-the-first-reading-through-it-book-club/), a memoir of growing up in a poor white family in what is now Trump country.) </blockquote>

There may or may not be a few other media mentions of Reading Through It in the pipeline. If you want to see what all the buzz is about, we're meeting next Wednesday, the 5th of July, in our usual location (Third Place Books Seward Park) at the usual time (7 p.m.). This time, we'll be discussing Jane Mayer's brilliant dissection of the right-wing Koch-powered political money machine, *Dark Money*. If you buy it at Third Place Books Seward Park, it'll be 20 percent off until the night of the event.

Also, you should like [the Reading Through It Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/readingthroughit/) and continue the discussion all month long.
