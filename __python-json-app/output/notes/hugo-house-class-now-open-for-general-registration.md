As [Paul previously mentioned](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/11/putting-the-you-in-book-review/), we're teaching a class at Hugo House about book reviewing. We've already met a few nice folks who have signed up, and we'd love it if you were there as well. 

Registration for Hugo House members was open a week ago, but [now anybody can sign up](https://hugohouse.org/store/class/the-you-review-of-books-paul-constant-and-martin-mcclellan/). We're going to have a lot of fun in this class &mdash; you'll walk away with a deep understanding of reviewing, and with a number of finished reviews on books you feel passionately about. 

We're making no secret of the fact that we're hoping to find future reviewers for this site, and what better way than to teach you everything we know? Please join us.
