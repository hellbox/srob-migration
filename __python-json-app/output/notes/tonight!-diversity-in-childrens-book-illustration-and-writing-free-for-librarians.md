Tonight is the <a href="https://wwa.scbwi.org/events/march-monthly-meeting/" title="Western Washington |   March Monthly Meeting">monthly meeting for SCBWI of Western Washington</a> (Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators), and the topic is diversity. Anybody who follows the children's market knows that diversity is a huge issue right now. From <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/krystieyandoli/this-11-year-old-girl-started-a-project-to-get-more-diverse#.morEQ2qnnJ" title="This 11-Year-Old Girl Started A Project Called #1000BlackGirls To Get More Diverse Books In Schools">Marley Dias</a> to <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-idea-of-freedom-might-be-too-great-a-temptation-for-them-to-resist/" title="The Seattle Review of Books -  â€œThe idea of freedom might be too great a temptation for them to resist&amp;quot;">George Washinton's slaves</a>, this is an important issue to explore in depth, especially from the point-of-view of creators. A great panel, including Philip Lee of <a href="https://www.leeandlow.com" title="Lee &amp; Low">Lee &amp; Low Books</a>, <a href="http://curiosityjones.net" title="Kelly Jones - author of Unusual Chickens for the Exceptional Poultry Farmer">Kelly Jones</a>, KCLS librarian Ann Crewdson, and <a href="http://www.lizwongillustration.com" title="Liz Wong Illustration, Freelance Illustrator and Artist">Liz Wong</a>, will be on hand to explore and offer suggestions. 

Even better, librarians get in free tonight, so come one come all to Demaray Hall at SPU. Program starts at 7pm. And, I'll be there too, so come find me and say hello.
