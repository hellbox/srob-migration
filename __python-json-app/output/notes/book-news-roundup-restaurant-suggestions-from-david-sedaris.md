* We got a very interesting call for submissions from [*PageBoy Magazine*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/writing-in-between-the-lines/):

<blockquote>*PageBoy Magazine* is now accepting submissions for our upcoming (tenth!) issue. We are following our Writers on Writers issue with an issue devoted exclusively to 17 word poems, or "17s" ... Please send 5-10 of your best works in prose or poetry - as long as each is exactly and only 17 words short - to pageboymagazine@hotmail.com by March 15, 2018. We are open to any style, any voice, as long as it "works," so do whatever you like with the form. We're curious to see what you come up with!</blockquote>

* The submission request goes on to explain that "17s are an old form, invented at Harry's Bar on 15th Ave E in Seattle during the fall of 2016." They "consist simply of 17 words, that is their ONLY constraint." I can't wait to see this issue.

* The [South Seattle Emerald interviews](https://southseattleemerald.com/2018/01/09/the-baby-making-novelist-bringing-the-grown-and-sexy-to-seattles-book-scene/)  Alvin “LA” Horn, a self-described "grown and sexy" novelist from South Seattle who's reading at Third Place Books Seward Park on January 15th. 

* If you have a high tolerance for internet slideshows, the *Seattle PI* has [a slideshow of the Seattle Public Library's most checked-out books of 2017](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/seattlenews/article/What-did-Seattle-read-in-2017-12472029.php?cmpid=twittersocialflow#item-85307-tbla-20) and it's very interesting.

* There are [a handful of tickets available](http://www.strangertickets.com/events/48471677/david-sedaris-workshop-readings) to see David Sedaris read at Broadway Performance Hall tonight and tomorrow.

* Speaking of Sedaris: earlier this week, he visited Poppy, a very good restaurant on Capitol Hill. They posted his suggestion card, which is packed with good advice. The real question is: why doesn't David Sedaris run a restaurant?

* And since we're still all talking about *THAT* Trump book, Masha Gessen's [review of *Fire and Fury* is very worth your time](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/fire-and-fury-is-a-book-all-too-worthy-of-the-president).
