The tulle veil<br>
was bone china<br>
white and thin.<br>
A breakable wisp.

It was fleeting.<br>
Mother snapped<br>
shots of it<br>
on Sundays. 

I sat in the family<br>
rocking chair<br>
in the unused room<br>
with ankles crossed.

Swirl feel<br>
under the skirt<br>
of my church dress.<br>
It lived there.

A lace sash<br>
tied off<br>
access to<br>
the pure me.

My holiness<br>
sewn<br>
delicate<br> 
as an eyelet.
