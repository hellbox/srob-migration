Tess Townsend [writes at ReCode](http://www.recode.net/2017/2/19/14660236/big-data-bullshit-college-course-university-washington): 

<blockquote><p>Two University of Washington professors are teaching a course to help students “think critically about the data and models that constitute evidence in the social and natural sciences,” according to the introduction to the course.</p>

<p>The 160-seat seminar, titled “Calling Bullshit in the Age of Big Data,” begins in late March and continues for roughly 10 weeks. Members of the general public can follow the course syllabus, including readings and recordings of lectures, at the course’s website.</p></blockquote>

[Here is the Calling Bullshit website](http://callingbullshit.org/), which includes a syllabus, tools, and case studies. The FAQ promises to post videos of the lectures in the near future. I hope professors Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West keep this project going beyond just the one class; we can use as many bullshit-callers as possible in the world right now.
