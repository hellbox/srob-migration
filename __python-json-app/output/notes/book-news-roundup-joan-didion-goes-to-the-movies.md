* Friends, I messed up. I failed to mention in this week's reading calendar that the [Seattle Anarchist Book Fair](http://seattleanarchistbookfair.net/) is **tomorrow, August 26th, from 10 am to 5 pm at the Vera Project in Seattle Center**. It features all kinds of neat organizations including Books to Prisoners, Left Bank Books, and the Social Justice Film Festival, and it's absolutely free. [Go check it out](http://seattleanarchistbookfair.net/), please.

* You should definitely read [this *Seattle Times* story](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/thanks-to-amazon-seattle-is-now-americas-biggest-company-town/) about how Seattle is now the country's biggest company town:

<blockquote><p>Amazon now occupies a mind-boggling 19 percent of all prime office space in the city, the most for any employer in a major U.S. city, according to a new analysis conducted for *The Seattle Times*.</p>

<p>Amazon’s footprint in Seattle is more than twice as large as any other company in any other big U.S. city, and the e-commerce giant’s expansion here is just getting started.</p></blockquote>

* Here's the thing about company towns: They always flourish until, suddenly, they stop flourishing.

* Seattle publisher Fantagraphics [announced this week](http://www.thebookseller.com/news/jim-broadbent-pens-graphic-novel-fantagraphics-619101) that they'll be publishing a comic called *Dull Margaret* written by the great actor Jim Broadbent.  

* I don't agree with the assessment that Joan Didion is "[the Original Millennial White Girl](https://electricliterature.com/how-ingrid-goes-west-deflates-joan-didion-the-original-millennial-white-girl-6bb50ce0656)," but I can tell you that the movie that inspired this observation, *Ingrid Goes West*, is a decent (if not great) comedy with a bad ending.

* Speaking of Didion, there's [a Netflix documentary about her coming out later this year](https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Netflix-Announces-Original-Documentaries-Joan-Didion-The-Center-Will-Not-Hold-and-Voyeur-20170823), along with a documentary about Gay Talese. 

* Neil Gaiman wrote a short-but-touching remembrance of sci-fi author Brian Aldiss [at *The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/22/brian-aldiss-science-fiction-writer-neil-gaiman).
