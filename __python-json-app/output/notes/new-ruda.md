Port Townsend's Copper Canyon Press, which Sherman Alexie once declared at a reading was the best poetry publisher in America, [broke a little book news yesterday at GalleyCat](http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/copper-canyon-press-to-publish-the-english-edition-of-a-new-pablo-neruda-collection/108209):

<blockquote>Copper Canyon Press will publish the English edition of a **new poetry collection by Nobel Prize-winning writer Pablo Neruda**. The Pablo Neruda Foundation announced the discovery of these 20 previously unknown pieces earlier this year.</blockquote>

The book will be titled *Then Come Back: The Lost Neruda*. 

Related: if you're looking to spice up your love life, the *Seattle Review of Books* heartily recommends that you and your partner read Neruda poems to each other, preferably in a breathy whisper. Works every time.
