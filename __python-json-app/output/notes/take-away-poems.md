Hugo House is hosting a one-day poetry broadside workshop Saturday August 8, run by local poet [J.T. Stewart](http://www.jackstraw.org/programs/writers/WritersForum/06/writers/jt.shtml), and master typographer [John D. Berry](https://www.tdc.org/officers/john-d-berry/). Poets will walk away with printed broadsides of their work. 

Broadsides were once the currency of the poetry underground. Learning how to design and print them is a great opportunity, especially if you've never seen your work come to life on paper right before your eyes. Having this level of experience and guidance available to you is a rare opportunity.
