**MONDAY** Our week starts off with the August edition of [Nerd Nite at Lucid Jazz Lounge](https://www.facebook.com/events/906049242807646/). As with every Nerd Nite, this one features two very different speakers. First up, Marielle Saums will discuss the history of bananas. Then, electrical engineer Krunal Desai, who press materials inform us “bailed on the auto industry to work on spacecraft,” will discuss why modern cars are so difficult to fix but so easy to hack.

**TUESDAY** [The Central Library hosts](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/last-bus-wisdom-evening-celebrating-and-memory-ivan-doig-annie-proulx-linda-bierds-david) a tribute to the dearly departed Northwest author Ivan Doig, with authors Annie Proulx, Linda Bierds, David Laskin, and Myra Platt all sharing memories of Doig and reading pieces in his honor. 

**WEDNESDAY** It’s [back to the Central Library for you](http://events.spl.org/115342882/JohnScalzireadsfromhisnewnovelTheEndofAllThings): sci-fi author John Scalzi will read from *The End of All Things*, which is the newest volume in his *Old Man’s War* series. Scalzi is an excellent novelist who is also an Important Figure on the Internet. He’s not afraid to be political — specifically, he’s not afraid to be a feminist — and he’s often a voice of reason when Twitter events begin to fly out of control, as they so often do.

**THURSDAY** [University Book Store hosts](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=08&evyear=2015&eventid=2015071314233600) The Coup frontman Boots Riley, who’ll be reading from his book of lyrics, poems, and essays, *Tell Homeland Security - We are the Bomb*. I’m a fan of the lot of The Coup’s music, but I think their song “Wear Clean Draws" is a stone-cold classic:

**FRIDAY** Tonight, you're returning to [University Book Store](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=08&evyear=2015&evdate=21&vec=mc), as author Nina Ansary appears in conversation with with Steve Gutzler. They’ll be discussing Ansary’s new book *Jewels of Allah: The Untold Story of Women in Iran*.Get a load of this, from the description of the event:

<blockquote>By digging into the actual impact of government policies, religious beliefs, and social norms, Ansary reveals the unintended increase of educated women following the repeal of gender equality laws, the influence of increased access to textbooks and women's magazines, and the powerful female voices and accomplishments by women in both Iran's past and present.</blockquote>


**SATURDAY** [Elliott Bay Book Company](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/ottessa-moshfegh) hosts a reading with Pushcart Prizewinning author Ottessa Moshfegh. She’ll be reading from her novel *Eileen*, the story of a secretary at a boy’s prison who escapes from a terrible domestic situation.


**SUNDAY** Seattle’s very best Oulipian writer, Doug Nufer, shares the stage with Paolo Pergola, a member of the Italian Oulipian group OPLEPO. Pergola will read constraint-based pieces in English and Italian. Nufer will likely read from his new book, *Lifeline Rule*. (Pergola’s bio also mentions that he has “translated Popeye into Italian.”) This is all happening at [Gallery 1412](https://gallery1412dotorg.wordpress.com/2015/08/06/august-23-paulo-pergola-and-doug-nufer-untangle-their-constraints/). Nufer’s readings are always a blast, and while we’re often visited by authors from around the country, we are not always visited by European writers. So we should give Pergola a warm Seattle welcome. Is that a thing? A "warm Seattle welcome?" Well, if it isn't, we should pretend that it is.
