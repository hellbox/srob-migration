<p class="intro">Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles we enjoyed this week, good for consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-sunday-post/" title="Sunday Post archives">look through the archives.</a></p>

<h5><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/janelleharris/i-was-ashamed-to-use-food-stamps-but-no-one-should-be" title="How I Stopped Being Ashamed Of My EBT Card - Buzzfeed">How I stopped being ashamed of my EBT card</a></h5>

<p>In this personal essay about the social stigma (and social anxiety) associated with using food stamps, Janelle Harris deftly de-others people who rely on public assistance to feed themselves and their families.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I built a career as a staff writer and editor that didn’t require me to work the same tiring hours in the same factory conditions that my mama did, and still does. I had all the tools I needed to live a life that — if it couldn’t be sleek and sexy like a Maserati — could at least be functional and dependable like a Jeep.</p>

<p>In 2012, when I was fired in an abrupt mass layoff from a job that was supposed to be reliable and steady, I decided to make a full-time pursuit of the freelance writing I’d been doing on the side for years. I knew I was taking a risk, and I was prepared for lean times. As a young single mom, I’d struggled financially through all of my adult years anyway. But I never considered that the trade-off for chasing a slow-materializing dream would be abject poverty.</p>

<h5><a href=“http://theweek.com/articles/749978/female-price-male-pleasure” title=“The female price of male pleasure - This Week”>The female price of male pleasure</a></h5>

<p>In response to the backlash against &#8220;Grace,&#8221; the young woman who spent <a href="https://babe.net/2018/01/13/aziz-ansari-28355">a more-than-uncomfortable evening with Aziz Ansari</a>, and to <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/01/sullivan-metoo-must-choose-between-reality-and-ideology.html">Andrew Sullivan&#8217;s &#8220;testosterone defense,&#8221;</a> Lili Loofbourow talks bluntly about bad sex. Can we not distinguish between sexual assault and sexual bullying and still reject both?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One side effect of teaching one gender to outsource its pleasure to a third party (and endure a lot of discomfort in the process) is that they're going to be poor analysts of their own discomfort, which they have been persistently taught to ignore.</p>

<p>In a world where women are co-equal partners in sexual pleasure, *of course* it makes sense to expect that a woman would leave the moment something was done to her that she didn't like.</p>

<p>That is not the world we live in.</p>

<p>Gentrification happens in waves of displacement; even the &#8220;virtuous&#8221; wave of artists and writers who make a neighborhood cool are pushing something else aside. Willy Staley has cautionary words for the affluent gentrifiers who push aside the artists — and who think <em>their</em> castles are built on rock.</p>

<blockquote>
New York’s skyline is erupting with buildings like these — stacks of cash-stuffed mattresses teetering in the wind. And *The Times* reported last year that the West Village’s Bleecker Street had fallen victim to “high-rent blight,” with commercial space becoming so expensive ($45,000 a month) that even Marc Jacobs couldn’t keep his stores open; shops that once catered to the wealthy now sit empty, waiting for a tenant who can foot the bill. When the heist is done and it’s time to split the loot, capital snuffs out culture.

<p>Documenting his father&#8217;s struggle with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, Peter Savodnik writes about how the disease devastated his own memories.</p>

<blockquote>
Madness is the nub of it. In the beginning, everyone — the patient and the people who love the patient — goes a little crazy. It’s only later, after you begin to see things better — not through the prism of denial or hope, but through statistics — that you realise none of those pills are likely to accomplish anything; that garden therapy and watercolour therapy cannot, in fact, heal damaged tissue; that the numbers cannot be spun. You are in a darkened room without doors or windows.
