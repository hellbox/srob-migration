Last weekend’s 39th annual [Norwescon]( http://www.norwescon.org/), as per usual, was the most fun a human being could possibly have in SeaTac. The sci-fi convention never fell for the media bombast and glitz that comic book conventions became enchanted by a decade ago; it’s always been a convention for fans and by fans, which means it’s a rare opportunity for writers and readers to get together in a low-stress, friendly environment.

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1459130880081/Apex-144dpi.jpg)</p>The belle of the ball this year was Seattle author Ramez Naam, whose novel *Apex* [won the Philip K. Dick Award]( http://rameznaam.com/2016/03/26/apex-wins-the-philip-k-dick-award/) at the convention. *Apex* is the third and final book in Naam’s Nexus trilogy — the others are *Nexus* and *Crux* — which centers around a nano-drug that telepathically links human beings. Naam is a central figure in Seattle’s up-and-coming sci-fi scene. He was one of [three Seattle authors shortlisted for the award this year]( http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/19/seattle-reps-hard-at-this-year-philip-k-dick-awards/), and he humbly gave acknowledgements to the other Seattle authors who were nominated whenever convention-goers congratulated him for his win.

The 40th Norwescon will happen over Easter weekend of 2017. If you’re a local sci-fi fan or author and you haven’t attended, you should save the date. There’s a whole community out there just waiting for you to join.
