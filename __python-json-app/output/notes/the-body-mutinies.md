When the doctor runs out of words and still<br>
I won't leave, he latches my shoulder and<br>
steers me out doors. Where I see his blurred hand,<br>
through the milk glass, flapping goodbye like a sail<br>
(&amp; me not griefstruck yet but still amazed: how<br>
words and names — medicine's blunt instruments —<br>
undid me. And the seconds, the half seconds<br>
it took for him to say those words). For now,<br>
I'll just stand in the courtyard, watching bodies<br> 
struggle in then out of one lean shadow<br>
a tall fir lays across the wet flagstones.<br>
Before the sun clears the valance of gray trees<br>
and finds the surgical-supply shop's window<br>
and makes the dusty bedpans glint like coins.
