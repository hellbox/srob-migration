We use a modified [Chicago](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) style here on the _Seattle Review of Books_. Recently, editing a piece that used the term ‘ebook’ sparked a discussion over which was better: ‘e-book’ or ‘ebook’? To our eyes, ‘e-mail’ seems antiquated (we use ‘email’), but are electronic books different? They are more modern, after all. If we have to designated something as _electronic_, as opposed to analog, is the hyphen still necessary? 

Help us decide. Take our first Twitter poll!
