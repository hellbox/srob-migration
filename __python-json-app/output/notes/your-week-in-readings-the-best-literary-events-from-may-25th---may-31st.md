<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday May 25: *Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman Reading* **</h5></p> 
See the Event of the Week column. *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday May 26: *White Sands* Reading
**</h5></p>
Geoff Dyer writes nimbly about difficult concepts that are exceptionally difficult for most writers to explain; he once wrote a book about not writing a book about D.H. Lawrence. *White Sands* is about travel, and the idea of travel, and living in the world; I can’t explain it, but I know Dyer can. *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday May 26: *Paper: Paging Through History* Reading**</h5></p>
In both *Cod* and *Salt*, Mark Kurlansky wrote huge, well-researched books about seemingly tiny topics which expand into nuanced histories of the entire world. His newest, Paper, promises to do the same trick with paper and the written word, though it also looks forward, at the prospect (threat?) of a paperless future. *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m. * 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday May 28: *Almost Live: The Show That Wouldn’t Die* Reading**</h5></p>
Now that we’re a world-class city with our very own giant Amazon balls, it’s hard to remember that Seattle used to have its own local low-budget *Saturday Night Live*. Bryan Johnston’s history of *Almost Live* includes interviews with nearly every cast member, making it a must-read for the three natural-born Seattleites who can still afford to live here. Third . *Third Place Books Lake Forest Park, 17171 Bothell Way NE, 366-3333, http://thirdplacebooks.com. Free. All ages. 6:30 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday May 29: Literary Events at Fokllife**</h5></p>
All weekend long Folklife hosts literary events like readings from the youth-poetry saints of Pongo Publishing, Greg Vandy’s book about Woody Guthrie, and more. On Sunday alone, you can find a whole bunch of children’s storytelling events and a reading from the Jack Straw Fellows hosted by beloved local poetry advocate Kathleen Flenniken. *Seattle Center, http://nwfolklife.org. Free. All ages. 11 A.M. * 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday May 30: *Author: The JT LeRoy Story* Screening**</h5></p>
In the late 1990s, everyone was obsessed with JT LeRoy, a media-shy author who wrote thinly veiled novels about his own life as a drug-addicted homeless youth. Then, LeRoy was outed as a middle-aged woman named Laura Albert. Jeff Feuerzeig’s documentary about LeRoy/Albert is coming to SIFF, and today I’ll be joining him for a post-screening interview. *Shoreline Community College, 16101 Greenwood Ave. N., 464.5830, http://siff.net. $13. All ages. 3 p.m. * 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday May 31: *Tribe* Reading**</h5></p>
Sebastian Junger is not just one of the dreamiest authors alive—he’s a hottie who fearlessly launches himself into dangerous situations—he’s also one of the most compassionate. His newest book, *Tribe*, documents the many pitfalls that befall veterans when they return to normal life in America, including suicide, PTSD, and drug *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m.*
