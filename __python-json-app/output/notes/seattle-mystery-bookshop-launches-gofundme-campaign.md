This morning, Pioneer Square's Seattle Mystery Bookshop [launched a GoFundMe campaign](http://seattlemysteryblog.typepad.com/seattle_mystery/2016/01/save-seattle-mystery-bookshop.html) "to make sure the rent is completely paid off, all our suppliers are happy, and to restore missing titles and depleted series to our shelves." Their goal is to [raise $50,000](https://www.gofundme.com/seattlemystery). Rewards for the campaign include signed first editions, a noirish 1974 Michael Garmin sculpture, tote bags, and coffee cups.

If you'd like to learn more about what makes Seattle Mystery Bookshop so great, we have a whole series of pieces explaining just that — they were our Bookstore of the Month back in September. We explained the [unique pleasures of the shop](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/02/our-september-bookstore-of-the-month-is-seattle-mystery-bookshop/), their [amazing propensity for finding just the right book for just the right person](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/09/the-recommendation-engine/), the way they [seduce non-mystery readers into reading mysteries](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/16/finding-the-inner-mystery-geek-in-all-of-us-since-1990/), and we ran some [brilliant recommendations from their booksellers](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/23/the-staff-of-seattle-mystery-bookshop-recommends-mysteries-for-people-who-think-they-hate-mysteries/).  

If crowd-funding isn't your thing, stop by Seattle Mystery Bookshop — they're at 117 Cherry St — and pick up a few titles. Your purchase will be much appreciated. Here's hoping they'll stick around to introduce readers to the great mysteries for many decades to come.
