It's not very often we post about celebrities here, but BuzzFeed editor Chris Geidner is on vacation in Seattle and he made a Very Important Celebrity Discovery at the central branch of the Seattle Public Library:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">tl;dr: I believe I just saw Cate Blanchett filming WHERE&#39;D YOU GO, BERNADETTE, so I&#39;d say the trip is going well. <a href="https://t.co/QMDTLkPN3G">pic.twitter.com/QMDTLkPN3G</a></p>&mdash; Chris Geidner (@chrisgeidner) <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/902233634953863168">August 28, 2017</a></blockquote>

Librarian Hayden Bass confirmed the sighting on her own feed:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not much, just hanging out with Cate Blanchett. You?<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/librarylife?src=hash">#librarylife</a> <a href="https://t.co/U7f0oJMTF5">pic.twitter.com/U7f0oJMTF5</a></p>&mdash; Hayden Bass (@librarianista) <a href="https://twitter.com/librarianista/status/902221700384690176">August 28, 2017</a></blockquote>

Cate Blanchett is amazing. The downtown library is amazing. Seattle is amazing. That is all.
