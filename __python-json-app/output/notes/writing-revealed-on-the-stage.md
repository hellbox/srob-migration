Sponsor Hugo House is here to let you know about two upcoming event series, both of which are tremendously awesome. First: Word Works: writers on writing. Six writers talkinga bout their process and skills, each focused on a particular part of writing. Second: Hugo Literary Series, where writers and musicians are given a theme or prompt, and debut original work based around that prompt live in front of an audience. 

You should be in that audience â€” event tickets are remarkably cheap, and fun will be had by all. In fact, we recommend you pick up the series passes &mdash; it's less than dinner at some midrange Seattle restaurants, and what you save in money you'll make up in pleasure and inspiration. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">Find out more on our sponsor's page</a>.
