Thanks to *Seattle Review of Books* readers [Joey Pillow](https://twitter.com/ThoreauPillow) and [@Polypodiaceae](https://twitter.com/Polypodiaceae) for catching our cameo appearance on tonight's *Late Night with Seth Meyers*, starting at the six minute mark in the video below:

Seth Meyers has been a fantastic late night host during the 2016 presidential election and its aftermath, and we're thrilled to be a resource for the show. Too bad it had to be during a segment about how our incoming president is borderline illiterate.
