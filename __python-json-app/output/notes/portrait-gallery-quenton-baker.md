**It Was Written book launch at Vermillion**</p>
<p class="noindent">
This Friday, Minor Arcana invites local poets including Robert Lashley and Brian McGuigan to help launch *It Was Written* with a book party at Vermillion. They’ll be joined by other readers including Quenton Baker, a poet who got his start as a hip-hop artist. Because the party would feel really weird without some form of live music, self-described “beat scientist” WD4D will be running the turntables at the show.
<br />*Vermillion Art Gallery and Bar, 1508 11th Ave., 709-9797, http://vermillionseattle.com. Free. 21+. 7 p.m.*
