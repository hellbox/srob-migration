<h5>[The A.I. Anxiety](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/12/27/aianxiety/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_resistancetwo-11pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory)</h5>

Impressive in both presentation, and reporting, this _Washington Post_ piece about the future of AI, and the people who worry over it, is endlessly fascinating.

<blockquote>
	<p>But the discussion reflects a broader truth: We live in an age in which machine intelligence has become a part of daily life. Computers fly planes and soon will drive cars. Computer algorithms anticipate our needs and decide which advertisements to show us. Machines create news stories without human intervention. Machines can recognize your face in a crowd.</p>

<p>New technologies — including genetic engineering and nanotechnology — are cascading upon one another and converging. We don’t know how this will play out. But some of the most serious thinkers on Earth worry about potential hazards — and wonder whether we remain fully in control of our inventions.</p>

<h5>[The Ghosts of Christmas: Was Scrooge the First Psychotherapy Patient?](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-ghosts-of-christmas-was-scrooge-the-first-psychotherapy-patient)</h5>

Okay, I know, we're into the new year and any tree left standing is one we should sneer at, but I loved this one last thought about [A Christmas Carol](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/24/in-praise-of-the-christmas-ghost-story/) &mdash; Elif Batuman looked at the psychology of Scrooge, and found something familiar. 

<blockquote>
	<p>That night, I decided to read the full text. Thanks to my robust personal experience with depression of both the normal and the holiday variety, I immediately recognized Scrooge’s condition, in a way that I had been unable to as a child. (Dickens himself was depressive, and probably bipolar.) I realized that I had misremembered Scrooge as gleeful in his miserliness, a human version of Scrooge McDuck, whose exuberance is eternally preserved in the cultural imagination by the image of the “money dive.” In fact, Scrooge takes no joy in anything. His London is a dystopian hellscape riddled by sickness, injustice, cold, and want. Money is the only protection—frail and inadequate—against these horrors, and Scrooge’s only thought is to work as hard as he can, every day, to store up as much money as possible.</p>

<h5>[When Fascism Was American](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/12/trump-coughlin-nazis-christian-front-kristallnacht-antisemitism-kasich-fascism/)</h5>

Joe Allen recalls our American tradition of fascism, looking at Father Charles Coughlin, and his taking on of the airwaves.

<blockquote>
	<p>Coughlin began broadcasting from his Michigan church, “The Shrine of the Little Flower,” in 1926, when radio represented a novel, thrilling experience for millions of people. With his rich baritone voice, and slight Irish brogue which he employed for great theatrical effect, Coughlin was made for the new medium.

<h5>[The Radical History of 1960s Adult Coloring Books](https://newrepublic.com/article/126580/radical-history-1960s-adult-coloring-books)</h5>

Everybody you know got them for the holidays, but when they first appeared in the 60s, they were quite a bit more subversive. 

<blockquote>
	The first adult coloring book, published in late 1961, mocked the conformism that dominated the post-war corporate workplace. Created by three admen in Chicago, the _Executive Coloring Book_ show pictures of a businessman going through each stage in his day, as though teaching a child what daddy does at work. But the captions, which give instructions on how to color the image, are uniformly desolate. “This is my suit. Color it gray or I will lose my job,” reads a caption next to a picture of a man getting dressed for work. Another page shows men in bowler hats boarding their commuter train. “This is my train,” it reads. “It takes me to my office every day. You meet lots of interesting people on the train. Color them all gray.” The rare appearance of a non-gray color is even more disturbing: “This is my pill. It is round. It is pink. It makes me not care.”
