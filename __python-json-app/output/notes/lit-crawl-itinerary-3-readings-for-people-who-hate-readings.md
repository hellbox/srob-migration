<p class="intro">On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our third suggested itinerary:</p>

If you're sick and tired of "traditional" readings, where someone stands up and talks about their book for fifteen minutes, Lit Crawl's got you covered. 

**1**. At Capitol Cider, Seattle Public Library librarians David Wright and Andrea Gough will present a cider flight, along with readings to go with each of the ciders. Gough and Wright are wonderful readers, and they're likely to uncover some real gems for this event. Plus, drinking with librarians is always a lot of fun.

**2**. At the Frye Art Museum, Rachel Kessler will present a slideshow performance of *Christian Charm Workbook*,  "her multimedia memoir about growing up with the Jesus movement in 1970s Seattle." Kessler is a great local writer, and she always finds some interesting ways to incorporate other media and performance into her work.

**3**. It's back to Capitol Cider for you, where Book-It Repertory Theater will perform a segment of their adaptation of David James Duncan's brilliant novel *Brothers K*, which is a retelling of *The Brothers Karamazov* set in Washington state.
