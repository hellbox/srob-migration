[Matt Driscoll at the *News Tribune*](http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/matt-driscoll/article162483123.html) says that a new 11-acre park on a peninsula in Tacoma is super-close to being named after *Dune* author (and Tacoma native) Frank Herbert. Tacoma is now taking suggestions to name the park. Driscoll writes:

<blockquote>According to Metro Parks spokesman Michael Thompson, 173 submissions were received over the weekend — and some variation of a name honoring Herbert was “the most common.” (There was at least one vote each for Parky McParkface and Breaky McWaterface.)</blockquote>

The park looks like it'll be gorgeous:

If you're a Tacoma resident, you can suggest a name for the park on [Metro Parks Tacoma's website](https://www.metroparkstacoma.org/dpd-peninsula-name) through August 4th.
