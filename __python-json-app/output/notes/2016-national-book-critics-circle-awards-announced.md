Winners include:

* In poetry, **Ross Gay**, author of *Catalogue of Unabashed Gratitude*, wins.
* The super-reflexive National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism goes to **Maggie Nelson** for *The Argonauts*, which [Cate McGehee reviewed for us a couple months ago](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/body-of-work/).
* The autobiography award goes to **Margo Jefferson** for *Negroland*.
* The winner for biography is **Charlotte Gordon**, author of *Romantic Outlaws: The Extraordinary Lives of Mary Wollstonecraft and Her Daughter Mary Shelley*.
* **Sam Quiñones**'s *Dreamland: The True Tale of America’s Opiate Epidemic* won for non-fiction.
* And **Paul Beatty**'s excellent novel *The Sellout* won the fiction award. [I reviewed *The Sellout* last year for Seattlish](http://seattlish.com/post/113965563161/that-sounds-cool-race-and-literature-at-the). It was obviously one of the best books of the year, a satire about race so sharp that it might cut off your fingers if you pick it up wrong.

This is **a fine list of great books** — perfect for the moment when you're standing in the bookstore wondering what you should read next.
