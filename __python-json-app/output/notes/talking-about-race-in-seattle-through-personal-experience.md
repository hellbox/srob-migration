Sponsor Lisa Richesson has an incredible story to tell in her book _White Lady, Black Sons_, one that explains Seattle's racist past through her direct experience. Lisa, a white woman, had two children with a black man. One, when she was a teenager, was put up for adoption. 

The first chapter of the book, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">which you can read on our Sponsor's page</a>, goes back even earlier to the first time she became aware of race, and just what happened in her cloistered white Catholic community when she became friends with a young black girl. It's a gripping story &mdash; read that chapter, and we think you'll agree, and want to know more.
