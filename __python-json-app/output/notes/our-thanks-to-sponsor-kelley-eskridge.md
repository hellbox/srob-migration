Our sponsor this week is a real treat. Not only is Kelley Eskridge's _Solitaire_ A New York Times Notable Book, a Borders Original Voices selection, and a Nebula, Endeavour, and Spectrum Award finalist, but shooting on a feature based on _Solitaire_ begins later this month in Australia. 

<a href="/sponsorships">Read a full chapter</a> here on the site. We give you great things to read in partner with our sponsors. It's our way of <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">fighting horrible internet advertising.</a>
