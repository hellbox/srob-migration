Everybody in Seattle is freaking out about the promised weekend wind storm that has whipped Cliff Mass into one of his [rare meteorological lathers]( http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2016/10/major-windstorm-tornadoes-and-much-more.html). *Seattle Review of Books* readers should know that two scheduled readings with local authors this weekend have been postponed due to weather: 

* Priscilla Long’s scheduled Elliott Bay Book Company event celebrating the launch of her two new books, *Fire and Stone: Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?* and *Minding the Muse: a Handbook for Painters, Composers, Writers and Other Creators*, has been moved to **Thursday, November 10th at 7 pm**.

* Jeannine Hall Gailey’s Open Books signing for her new poetry collection *Field Guide to the End of the World* — [read my review here](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/and-i-feel-fine/) — is now scheduled for **Sunday October 29th from 4 to 6 pm**.

Tomorrow’s storm  looks like it’s going to be a big one, folks. Stay inside, stay warm, stay safe, buy some candles and junk food, and settle in under a comforter with a big stack of books, okay? We’re giving you permission.
