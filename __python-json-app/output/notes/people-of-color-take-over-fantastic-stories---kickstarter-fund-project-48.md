<p class="intro">Every week, the _Seattle Review of Books_ backs a Kickstarter, and writes up why we picked that particular project. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/08/announcing-the-seattle-review-of-books-kickstarter-fund/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Announcing the Seattle Review of Books Kickstarter Fund">Read more about the project here</a>.

<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_People Of Color Take Over Fantastic Stories_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1271384462/people-of-color-take-over-fantastic-stories). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Warren Lapine](http://www.fantasticstoriesoftheimagination.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
Fantastic Stories is a top paying market that is open and looking for stories from underrepresented communities and cultures.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>
	
<p class="noindent">
Well, first, we need to offer a _complete and total nepotism / conflict of interest_ report: Nisi Shawl, who writes our SFFH column <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-future-alternative-past" title="The Seattle Review of Books">the Future Alternative Past</a>, is the guest editor in question if this Kickstarter succeeds, so let us say this clearly and without reserve: _you cannot trust our objectivity on this_. 
</p>

But still, are you kidding me? A complete POC take over issue is a fantastic idea, and good on _Fantastic Stories of the Imagination_ (for those of you, like me, who were curious about the title's remarkable resemblence to ye olde classic _Fantastic Stories_, editor Warren Lapine <a href="http://www.fantasticstoriesoftheimagination.com/editorial/" title="Editorial: Welcome to Fantastic Stories of the Imagination &amp;#8211; Fantastic Stories">tells the story here</a>) for taking this important step. This is the kind of project we like funding. Also, Nisi explains it well in the video, so please do watch that. 


<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
Because there are people that actually complain about stuff like this. Did you know that? People who think its "politically correct" or "reverse-racist", or something equally idiotic, to focus a magazine on people of color. As Nisi says "there persists a perception that science fiction and fantasy is somehow a white field". Now, that's just stupid. In an article on the website, Nisi points out black people <a href="http://www.fantasticstoriesoftheimagination.com/a-crash-course-in-the-history-of-black-science-fiction/" title="A Crash Course in the History of Black Science Fiction &amp;#8211; Fantastic Stories">have been involved with the genre since the very beginning</a>. 
</p>

As fans, it's imperative to stand up and say that what we care about most is good stories, and the authors she's picked to highlight are certainly going to deliver on that front. Let's make sure they get the chance, yes? 


<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	They're just getting started, at 13% funded, and 32 days to go.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
