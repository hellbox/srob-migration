Wondering what to read with your late lunch this Monday afternoon? Try a chapter from sponsor Joe Ponepinto's *Mr. Neutron* — a political, science-fictional satire starring a down-and-out political flunky and a cadaverous (in the best way) mayoral candidate in small-town Grand River.

Ponepinto is known to many of you as the founding publisher and fiction editor of the [*Tahoma Literary Review*](https://tahomaliteraryreview.com/). We're honored to have him as a sponsor and delighted to suggest his lastest to you.
