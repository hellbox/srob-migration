<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Letters for Lucardo: An Erotic Graphic Novel_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ironspike/letters-for-lucardo-an-erotic-graphic-novel?ref=category_recommended). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Iron Spike](http://twitter.com/Iron_Spike).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

When an aged mortal man and immortal vampire fall in love, painful realities about death—and the deathless—interfere.

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>
	
<p class="noindent">
Look, friends, this week it's really simple: not knowing what's coming with our country, backing an erotic queer story of interracial vampire-human romance seems downright political. I want publishers like Iron Circus (run by the kickass C. Spike Trotman, who [flipped off the gatekeepers of the comics world, and built a thriving publishing house her own way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CojfpoRZXOk)) to have as much money as possible on hand for whatever may come under this coming administration. 
</p>


<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
First, Iron Circus puts out extremely high quality smut, filled with characters you'll love and stories that compel you to turn every page. There's a lot of sex, too, and romance. This isn't your old alt-press boner-fest comix from the sweaty back room for the horny fanboys; this is complex, real relationships in fantastical settings drawn by well-paid artists, written by amazing writers, with a focus on diversity of all kinds. It's the real deal.
</p>

Iron Spike does a lot of Kickstarters (this is number ten!). They know what they're doing, and they know how to deliver quality goods. Back this, give them some money, and let's get their coffers stuffed to the gills. Maybe they won't need lawyers in the upcoming administration, but being able to afford some will do wonders.


<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	They're 212% funded. They don't need us, we need them.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
