Piper Daniels interviews excellent local poet Maged Zaher [over at the *Monarch Review*](http://www.themonarchreview.org/w-a-s-h-with-maged-zaher/) about race, Seattle, and street harassment. It's a must-read. Zaher is more than just one of the best poets in Seattle; he's also one of our most fearless political voices.
