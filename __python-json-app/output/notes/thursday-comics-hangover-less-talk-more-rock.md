I enjoyed the first issue of sci-fi writer Saladin Ahmed's *Black Bolt* series for Marvel Comics, but I ultimately didn't continue with the book, because Black Bolt is the very definition of a one-note character. The best writing in the world couldn't make an aloof mute king with a tuning fork on his forehead a compelling protagonist. But there was so much talent in evidence in that first issue of *Black Bolt* that when I saw Ahmed had a new creator-owned series coming out from Boom! Studios, I was eager to give it a try.

*Abbott*, published for the first time yesterday, is a new series about an African-American newspaper reporter in 1972 Detroit. Elena Abbott is described in the first issue of *Abbott* as a "black Lois Lane," but Ahmed admits in interviews that he envisions the character as more along the lines of the cult TV show *Kolchak the Night Stalker*.

A tough Black journalist on the mean streets of 70s Detroit, fighting supernatural menaces? Yes, please! *Abbott* has all the makings of a great comic series, and artist Sami Kivelä is a revelation: he draws apartments that look lived in, and figures that have lived entire lives. It's a flat-out gorgeous book.

It's a shame, then, that the first issue of *Abbott* suffers from a pretty severe cass of first-issue-itis. There are a lot of word balloons here covering up Kivelä's beautiful artwork, and a lot of them could have been trimmed. The exposition flows hot and heavy, with a lot of telling and not enough showing. Early in the issue, Abbott shows up at a crime scene with her own camera. She's greeted by an older white photographer. This is their exchange:

<blockquote><p>—Holy crap, Abbott, Fred's got you taking your own pictures now? That's ridiculous. He giving you any kind of budget?</p>

<p>—Hello, Murray. It's not Fred. It's the higher-ups. Someone didn't care for my police brutality stories. I'm being punished.</p>

<p>—That's too bad. You're a good reporter, Abbott. A damn good reporter. Better than the little @#$%& I'm working with now.</p>

<p>—Thank you, Murray. And you're the best crime photographer in Detroit.</p>

<p>—Now you're just flattering me.</p>

<p>—Well, it is possible I'm hoping you'll tell me what the police know here, since no one else will.</p></blockquote>

This exchange desperately needs an editor.  There's way too much backstory and repetition and cross-talk for the first few pages of a comic. I'd love to see Murray and Abbott's history relayed through an intimate exchange that didn't lay everything out so plainly.

As the issue carries on, *Abbott* starts to pick up in pace, building to a cliffhanger that really sets the premise in motion. I'm definitely coming back for the second issue. But I'm also willing to bet that the second issue of *Abbott* should have been the first issue; dropping the reader in the middle of the action and forcing them to figure out the story as it goes along is always preferable to explaining everything.
