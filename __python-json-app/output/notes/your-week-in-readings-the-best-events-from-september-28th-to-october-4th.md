**MONDAY**  It’s not very often that I send you out to Bellevue, but tonight I bring you a very good reason to head east: the Bellevue branch of [University Book Store](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=09&evyear=2015&eventid=2015072809421300&pre=20150917&pst=20150930) hosts an evening with a number of poets reading from *Raising Lily Ledbetter*, a [compelling anthology of poetry about women at work that I reviewed a few weeks ago](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-ballad-of-rosie-the-riveter/). Readers include **Carolyne Wright, Eugenia Toledo, Kathya Alexander, Deborah Woodard, Judith Roche, Erin Fristad, and Mary Ellen Talley**. 

**TUESDAY** Cartoonist **Ted Rall** will discuss his excellent comic-book biography of Edward Snowden at [Town Hall](https://townhallseattle.org/event/ted-rall/) tonight. He’ll be interviewed onstage by some jerk named Paul Constant, who press materials inform us is the co-founder of a site called the *Seattle Review of Books*.

So because we here at *SRoB* have a conflict-of-interest rule that insists we provide an alternate event on nights when we’re taking part in a reading, our **ALTERNATE TUESDAY**: event is a doozy: [Seattle Arts and Lectures](https://www.facebook.com/events/530655200421254/) presents an evening with poets **[Mary Szybist](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/mary-szybist) and [Robert Wrigley](https://www.lectures.org/season/poetry_series.php?id=425)**. Szybist is interested in what it means to have a body, and Wrigley writes about nature and spirituality in a very interesting way. Expect a smart discussion about corporeality and its limits.


**WEDNESDAY** We’ve got a two-fer tonight: First up, awesome small press festival Short Run, which is preparing a month’s worth of events in October, presents a Zine and Comix Fair in the lobby of [Northwest Film Forum](https://www.facebook.com/events/1633425980248234/). After the fair, though, you should head down to Vermillion for the 5th anniversary celebration of  Seattle’s other great small-press festival, the [APRIL Festival](https://www.facebook.com/events/888131334595609/). Readers include **Stacey Levine**, who is one of the best short story writers in all of Seattle and such an incredible reader of her own work that she released a single on Sub Pop, and **Don Mee Choi**, who is one of my favorite local poets. Think of it as a mini-lit crawl with two stops!

**THURSDAY** [Ravenna Third Place Books](http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/ravenna-ryan-boudinot-paul-constant-eric-reynolds-and-prof-sonora-jha-seattle-city-literature) hosts **Ryan Boudinot, Paul Constant, Eric Reynolds, and Sonora Jha** having a panel discussion about Seattle’s literary scene to celebrate the release of Boudinot’s new book, *Seattle: City of Literature*. Reynolds is an editor at Fantagraphics, which means he works on some of the best comics in America. Boudinot, most recently, is the author of [*The Octopus Rises*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/picking-wires-from-a-bowl-of-noodles/). And Jha is the local author of [a great novel called *Foreign*](http://sonorajha.com/foreign/) that was for some reason only published in India, but which you can buy at Elliott Bay Book Company.

And because I’m on that panel, your **ALTERNATE THURSDAY** event is at [University Book Store](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=10&evyear=2015&eventid=2015042811052100&pre=20151001&pst=20151009), where the wonderful writer **Lauren Groff** presents her new and much-ballyhooed novel *Fates and Furies*, which is described as a “portrait of a modern marriage told with the fury and force of a Greek myth.”

**FRIDAY** [Hugo House](http://hugohouse.org/event/celebration-for-seattle-city-of-literature/ ) hosts a big splashy launch party for *Seattle: City of Literature*, featuring **Ryan Boudinot, Rick Simonson, Jim Lynch, Elissa Washuta, Charles Mudede, and Brian McGuigan**.

**SATURDAY** Elliott Bay Book Company hosts Ian Brennan and Bob Forrest. The authors will discuss Brennan's novella, *Sister Maple Syrup Eyes*, and Forrest’s memoir *Running With Monsters*. Forrest apparently has something to do with a show called *Celebrity Rehab*, and his book includes reminiscences of River Phoenix’s death.

**SUNDAY** The [Beacon Hill branch of Seattle Public Library](http://www.spl.org/calendar-of-events?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D115298706) hosts a free screening of the movie *The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1* and also hosts a discussion of the book on which the movie is based. The film series is set to conclude this fall, which makes this an interesting time to discuss the final book in the series. Half of the book has already been (poorly) adapted, so what’s the second half going to be like? Is there a chance that the *Hunger Games* film series can rebound and reclaim the greatness of its second installment? Is *Mockingjay* even a good book to begin with? These questions, and more, will finally be settled once and for all. (No pressure!)
