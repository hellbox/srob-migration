If so, you could offer to [host the Friends of the Library's annual book sale](http://www.friendsofspl.org/book-sales/).

<blockquote>The Friends of The Seattle Public Library is searching for a 9,000 square foot facility to process material for its annual book sales. The current lease at the Washington Talking Book & Braille Library in South Lake Union ends in late 2018. For the past 46 years, the Friends book sales have provided inexpensive used books to raise money for The Seattle Public Library.</blockquote>
