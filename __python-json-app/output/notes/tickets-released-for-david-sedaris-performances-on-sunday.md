<p class="noindent">Good news if you were frustrated by entirely sold-out shows for David Sedaris' series of readings &mdash; Sponsor Northwest Associated Arts has informed us that tickets for both the matinee and evening show this Sunday, the 15th, have just been released. <a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2705407" title="David Sedaris">Act fast!</a></p>

If you somehow miss snagging one of those, we've also been told that a small number of tickets will be available at the door for most performances. If you're deep Sedaris fan who wasn't able to grab tickets in time, you might want to give the box office a try right before the performances. You can also read more about all of this on our <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">Sponsor's page.</a> 

<a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">We have released our new sponsorship dates</a>! Sign-up to become a sponsor. Most dates from Feb â€” July are available, so snag yours while you can. We typically sell out, and it would be great to make sure you're in the calendar. It's the only guaranteed way to make sure your work gets in front of our audience.
