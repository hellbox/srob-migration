Once upon a time a man took me to dinner, asked<br>
if I’d been abused as a child, like that would explain it.<br>
Sure. I keep a cabinet of curiosities &mdash;<br>
but that was never one of them. See the dust?<br>
Things we’re too old for slip off shelves,<br>
line up to watch. In direct sunlight they’re small,<br>
made of ash, disintegrating like abrupt love.<br>
To recall a memory weakens it,<br>
which means what exactly? Between what I want<br>
and what I want to be, I get a little lost.<br>
Blame the dinners where my glass fills again and again<br>
before it’s ever emptied. _Trauma_ and _der Traum_<br>
aren’t etymologically related, which makes sense<br>
but also not.
