On Mars, water once flowed. Where<br>
did it go? Some froze, but scientists

suspect a cosmic cue ball &mdash; a comet<br>
etc. &mdash; knocked Mars so hard

the planet escaped<br>
its own atmosphere, just

left it there, jumped its own skin<br>
like an anime cat

leaving his pajamas spread-eagle<br>
in space. And now, goddammit,

David Bowie is dead.<br>
I worshipped him like a flower

twists its dewy face to the brightest,<br>
prettiest star. He asked us,

decades down, “Is there life on Mars?”<br>
Once, perhaps. There once was life

in Bowie too. Stars glitter,<br>
planets don’t &mdash;

an atmospheric parlor trick,<br>
but neither titan ceases

to exist just because<br>
a little air escaped.
