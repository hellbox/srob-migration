*(Every Monday in December, we're asking a local bookseller which books they'd like to receive for a holiday gift. Our third bookseller is Jason Vanhee who works at University Book Store. Jason chose* [SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome](http://www4.bookstore.washington.edu/_trade/ShowTitleUBS2.taf?ActionArg=Title&ISBN=9781631492228&SKU=7924352&sdb=ALL) *by Mary Beard and* [Dynasty: the Rise and Fall of the House of Caesar](http://www4.bookstore.washington.edu/_trade/ShowTitleUBS2.taf?ActionArg=Title&ISBN=9780345806727&SKU=1934103&sdb=ALL), *by Tom Holland.)*

I work at University Book Store, but I’d been away for a few years and I just came back, so I didn’t see these in hardcover. I am a super-fan of Roman history and I’m really incredibly excited to get one or both of these as gifts. *SPQR* has been doing gangbusters — we had her for an event; I’m so sad I didn’t get to go, but I was working.  I really can't wait to read some new [laughs] — “*new*” — Roman history.
