The fifth issue of Seattle-based literary magazine the *James Franco Review*, in which every submission is treated "as if we were all James Franco, as if our work was already worthy of an editorâ€™s attention," is rolling out now. The first piece of issue five to see publication is [a collection of poems from Aricka Foreman](http://thejamesfrancoreview.com/2015/11/30/poetry-by-aricka-foreman/), including "Monologues in Bars By White People With Good Intentions" and the especially haunting "Consent Is A Labyrinth of Yes." [Go take a look](http://thejamesfrancoreview.com/2015/11/30/poetry-by-aricka-foreman/), and keep an eye out for the rest of issue five, which will be rolling out in the days to come.
