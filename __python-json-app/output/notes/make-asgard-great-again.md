Neil Gaiman's sold-out reading at Benaroya Hall is this Sunday. [Over at the *San Diego Tribune*](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/books/sd-et-author-gaiman-20170313-story.html), he talks about his new book, *Norse Mythology*, which retells Norse myths in more modern prose. Here he talks about a story in which the leader of the gods leads a crusade against foreigners:

<blockquote>I remember being in New York the other day and reading it in the town hall and when I got to the point where Odin says, “**We’re going to build a wall**,” the entire hall erupted. And I thought, “Well, there you go. These stories may be old, but they are definitely relevant.”</blockquote>
