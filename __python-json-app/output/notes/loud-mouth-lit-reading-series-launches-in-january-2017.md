Seattle-area writer Paul Mullin just announced that he's kicking off 2017 with a new reading series called Loud Mouth Lit. Admission is free, it happens at Greenlake's St. Andrew’s Bar and Grill, and the first reading happens on January 31st at 8 pm, with new outings on the last Tuesday of every month thereafter.

Loud Mouth Lit looks to be a nice blend of literary and theater influences, bringing together Mullin's experience as a Stranger Genius Award-winning playwright and a [memoirist](https://www.facebook.com/theStartingGateBook/). Mullin says upcoming readers include "Seattle’s favorite playwright/ puppeteer raconteur Scot Augustson" and "Playwright, screenwriter, and smut virtuoso Kelleen Conway Blanchard." 

Save the date for the first Loud Mouth Lit and keep an eye out for more announcements from Mullin, who seems to be gearing up for a very productive 2017.
