The library [looks gorgeous](http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/2017/0505/Obama-unveils-ambitious-plans-for-an-unusual-new-presidential-library-in-Chicago) and the plan for it to be a community center in the South Side of Chicago is wonderful. Something that I'm not happy about: it's going to be the **first paperless presidential library**. You'd think that a president who loves books as much as Obama would understand the value of the printed word. In a world full of bad news, I don't want to spend too much time or energy complaining about this. But still, it's a little disappointing.
