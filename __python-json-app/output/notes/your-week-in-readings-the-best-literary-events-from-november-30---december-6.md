<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday November 30th: *My Old Man and the Mountain* Reading
**</h5></p> 

The youngest son of “Big Jim” Whittaker, the first American to climb Mount Everest, is also a mountain climber. Maybe Leif Whittaker can explain what the deal is with his bizarre family business — everybody knows the punchline “because it’s there,” but what really makes two generations of a family decide to climb mountains? *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday December 1st: *Moonglow* Reading**</h5></p> 

Michael Chabon’s latest novel combines rocket science, deathbed confessions, and family secrets into one memoirish novel. Ostensibly a story about Chabon’s dying grandfather, *Moonglow* is quieter and more direct than some of his other novels, and its realism and relatively simple sentences might open Chabon up to a new audience. *Seattle Public Library, 1000 4th Ave., 386-4636, http://spl.org. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.* 
 
<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday December 2nd: The Furnace Says Goodnight**</h5></p> 

See our Literary Event of the Week column for more details. *Hollow Earth Radio, 2018 E. Union St., 617-1683, hollowearthradio.org. Free. All ages. 8 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday December 3rd: Rainier Valley Lit Crawl**</h5></p> 

The fourth Rainier Valley Lit Crawl centers around Hillman City, venturing to, in order, Spinnaker Bay, Big Chickie, Adugenet, and Union Bar. Those four venues will host an array of authors including Daemond Arrindell, Sarah León, Fernando Pérez, Jekeva Phillips, Anastacia Renee, Thomas Walton, and Corina Zappia. *Spinnaker Bay,  5718 Rainier Ave S., 725-2337, http://gregbem.com/. Free. All ages. 5 p.m.* 


<h5>**Sunday December 4th: Urban Craft Uprising**</h5></p> 

Seattle’s largest craft show is a great place to cross off all the last-minute gifts on your holiday shopping list. You can find a little bit of everything here, but be sure to visit the seven papercraft exhibitors, including journal makers, book arts experts, and letterpress printers. *Seattle Center Exhibition Hall,  4326 301 Mercer St, http://urbancraftuprising.com Free. All ages. 10 a.m.* 


<h5>**Monday December 5th: *Thank You for Being Late* Reading**</h5></p> 

This reading from Thomas Friedman’s latest book, *Thank You for Being Late*, is ostensibly sold out, but many Town Hall events have last-minute seating available for people who show up and wait in line. Friedman’s latest book — about technology, globalization, and climate change — looks like it’s worth a few minutes of standing in the cold.  *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m.* 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday December 6th: *The Way of the Writer* Reading**</h5></p>
Charles Johnson is a Seattle-area legend. The UW professor and National Book Award-winning novelist’s latest book collects a lifetime of learning under the ambitious title *The Way of the Writer: Reflections on the Art and Craft of Storytelling*. Tonight, Johnson will talk onstage with one of his prize students, the novelist David Guterson. *Northwest African American Museum, 2800 S. Massachusetts St., 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*
