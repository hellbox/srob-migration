* Don't forget to come to the Reading Through It Book Club tomorrow night at Third Place Books Seward Park as we discuss former Labor Secretary Robert Reich's new book *Economics in Wonderland*. The book, published by Seattle comics geniuses Fantagraphics, is a great primer on why income inequality is so horrible right now and what we can do to fix it. [Here's the Facebook event listing](https://www.facebook.com/events/382566692170310/). I hope you'll join us.

* You can [now apply for Artist Trust's Fellowship Awards](http://artisttrust.org/index.php/for-artists/money#fellowship), which give $7,500 to ten artists of any discipline. Applications close on March 5th, so don't procrastinate. 

* Type Set, which is a coworking space for writers in Seattle's south end, is trading a membership in exchange for a couple hours per week of social media and clerical volunteer work. [Read more about it here](https://www.facebook.com/TypeSetSeattle/posts/1160402547435795).

* There's now [a GoFundMe set up to crowdfund late Seattle cartoonist Mark Campos's last book, *Casino Son*](https://www.gofundme.com/print-mark-camposs-casino-son). Ten bucks gets you a copy of the book and helps Campos's family.

* And in national book news, Oprah's next Book Club pick is *An American Marriage*, a novel by Tayari Jones. You can [read an interview with Jones about what it's like to take the call from Oprah](http://ew.com/books/2018/02/06/american-marriage-tayari-jones-oprahs-book-club/) at *Entertainment Weekly*.

* Also, *House of Leaves* author Mark Danielewski's latest project, which was anticipated to be a 27-volume series, has "been paused" due to lack of sales at volume 5.

There’s no denying the intense readership that showed up for this endeavor: bright, ambitious, inspiring, inquisitive, compassionate, rare, energetic, involved, brave, funny too, and most of all beautifully aware. Unfortunately, I must agree with Pantheon that for now the number of readers is not sufficient to justify the cost of continuing. If there is solace, find it with her: Xanther remains our new storm, VEM’s as real as any sky, and Redwood depends on no book by me to harrow this world. Read well and live well, then you will love well. The rest is in the wind. . . . . . . . . . #thefamiliar #seasonone #beahymnforgood #markzdanielewski #houseofleaves #onlyrevolutions #thefiftyyearsword</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A post shared by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/markzdanielewski/" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;" target="_blank"> Mark Z.
