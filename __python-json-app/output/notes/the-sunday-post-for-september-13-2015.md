<h5>[Man, weeping](http://aeon.co/magazine/society/is-there-anything-wrong-with-men-who-cry/)</h5>

[Sandra Newman](https://twitter.com/sannewman "Sandra Newman (@sannewman) | Twitter") &mdash; who is the funniest person on Twitter, and an amazing writer to boot &mdash; looks at the history of male tears.

<blockquote>So where did all the male tears go? The truth is, we don’t know for certain. There was no anti-crying movement. No treatises were written against men’s tears, and no leaders of church or state introduced measures to discourage them. Their decline occurred so slowly and quietly that no one seems to have noticed it happening. But by the 18th century, proponents of the Cult of Sensibility were exhorting men to be more sensitive, with an emphasis on free-flowing tears, which implies that males were already regarded as lachrymally challenged. By the Romantic period, masculine tears were reserved for poets. From here, it’s just a short leap to the poker-faced heroes of Ernest Hemingway, who, despite their poetic leanings, cannot express grief by any means but tippling and shooting the occasional buffalo.</blockquote>

<h5>[By Any Other Name: The Best American Pseudonym 2015](http://www.kenyonreview.org/2015/09/by-any-other-name-the-best-american-pseudonym-2015/)</h5>

Over at the Kenyon Review, poet Amit Majmudar takes a deep, nuanced, and fascinating looks at the Sherman Alexie white-poet-appropriating-Chinese-name-for-idiotic-reasons thing ([white dudes: on't do it](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/08/so-did-i-pick-the-best-75-poems-published-last-year-of-course-not-i-picked-75-poems-that-survived-a-literary-ordeal-that-happened-only-in-my-brain/ "The Seattle Review of Books - &quot;So did I pick the best 75 poems published last year? Of course not. I picked 75 poems that survived a literary ordeal that happened only in my brain.&quot;")).

<blockquote><p>Editors often say they are looking for what is “unconventional” or “new,” but the new doesn’t exist (just ask Ecclesiastes), and literary conventions vary from clique to clique and era to era—is free verse conventional, or is a sonnet conventional? Depends on which century you’re referring to. What readers and editors alike desire is for the familiar language—English—to be estranged into poetry. For the familiar object to be perceived anew, as a strange thing, as if for the first time…so that a red wheelbarrow you have seen a thousand times before is no longer a red wheelbarrow you have seen a thousand times before. It is, forever after, the red wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>And that is what the byline “Chou” did to Hudson’s competent poem. “Chou” estranged what were thoroughly unstrange cultural references and sentiments. If we take a poem as inclusive of its byline—much as the word Monet at the bottom right hand corner is part of the painting of waterlilies—then that pseudonym is the most ingenious, most poetic part of a goodish poem; from this perspective, Alexie’s positive response to it was not a matter of nepotism at all.</p></blockquote>

<h5>[I never noticed how racist so many children’s books are until I started reading to my kids](http://www.vox.com/2015/7/10/8901109/childrens-books-racist-sexist)</h5>

Anybody who has read around ages-old racial stereotypes in popular kids books while reading before bedtime will appreciate this [Leigh Anderson](https://twitter.com/leighanderson_ "Leigh Anderson (@LeighAnderson_) | Twitter") piece on just that topic. It starts with her deciding to order a copy of _Little Black Sambo_.

<blockquote><p>I remember the story primarily for its description of the tigers chasing one another round and round a tree until they melt into butter, butter that Sambo's mother uses for a stack of crispy pancakes. In the 35 intervening years, I knew the book had been relegated to the dustbin of racist cultural artifacts, but I didn't remember it well enough to know why.</p>

<p>The young woman at the bookstore register flinched when I asked for the book and said she couldn't order it for me; Amazon, until recently agnostic on race relations, dropped a copy in a plain brown wrapper on my doorstep. A quick skim revealed illustrations with the minstrel-show aesthetic — bright, white, round eyes, bulging red lips — of "darky" iconography.</p></blockquote>


<h5>[High Schoolers Stage "Read-In" Protest in Solidarity with Teachers' Strike](http://www.thestranger.com/blogs/slog/2015/09/11/22847122/high-schoolers-stage-read-in-protest-in-solidarity-with-teachers-strike)</h5>

Seattle teachers are striking. We absolutely love the gumption of the kids, in this [Rich Smith](https://twitter.com/goodeveningmaam "Rich Smith (@goodeveningmaam) | Twitter") piece from _The Stranger_, staging a read-in. First, what a fantastic form of protest. Second, we at the _SRoB_ are behind the teachers 100%. My kid is sitting out his first few days of Kindergarten during the strike right now, and we couldn't be more proud of where his teachers have drawn the line in the abuse the legislature and school district keep dumping on them. No cost-of-living increase in six years means their salary goes down every year. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court fines our pathetic legislature, who only find constitutional adherence something to crow about on the national level. 

I propose that today when you read, read for the teachers. When you read this link, or whatever book you're on right now, think back to the teacher that inspired you to learn and want to keep learning. Then maybe write a note to your state respresentative and tell them to get their damn acts together.

<blockquote>Eli Konsker said he organized the event in solidarity with the teachers' strike because teachers have supported him during his three years at Nathan Hale High School. But he also wanted to offer students a chance to be productive even though they weren't in school. "I invited people to work on college essays, finish up summer reading, anything educational," he said.</blockquote>
