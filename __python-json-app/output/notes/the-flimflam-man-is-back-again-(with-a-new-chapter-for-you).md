Many, many thanks to Pope Brock for his two-week sponsorship of the site! This week brings the second delightful taste of *Charlatan: America’s Most Dangerous Huckster, the Man Who Pursued Him, and the Age of Flimflam*. This vivid, hilarious, and fast-paced history of the early twentieth-century quack Dr. John Romulus Brinkley is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year. The timing is right, the themes are on point, and the storytelling will keep you turning pages. Check out chapter 1 [on our sponsorship page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/) for the further adventures of Dr. Brinkley and a glimpse into the darkest heart of our, um, darkest fears.

Sponsors like Pope Brock make the *Seattle Review of Books* possible. Did you know [you could sponsor us, as well](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/)? If you have a book, event, or opportunity you’d like to get in front of our readers, [reserve your dates now](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/) — June and July are the last dates available in our first block of the year!
