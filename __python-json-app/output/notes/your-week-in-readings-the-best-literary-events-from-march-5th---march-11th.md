<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday, March 10: *All About Lulu* Reading **</h5></p>
About a decade ago, Bainbridge Island author Jonathan Evison published his very good debut novel, *All About Lulu*. Tonight, he's celebrating a special 10th anniversary edition of *Lulu* with a big party including music from Mary Ocher and probably some cheap beer. Evison is publishing a new novel, *Lawn Boy*, later this year, so this event will likely be a ramp-up as the author transitions from the monklike world of writing to a more public-facing world of book tours..
