* Push/Pull, the art gallery and comics shop in Ballard, is launching the 2018 edition of their book club tomorrow at 11 am. Their first book club selection, *Everfair*, culminated in [an art show with an appearance by Seattle author (and *SRoB* contributor) Nisi Shawl](https://www.ballardnightout.com/ballard-night-out/everfair-art-opening-w-reading-by-author-nisi-shawl-pushpull). This year's selection is Nick Joaquin's *The Woman Who Had Two Navels & Tales of the Tropical Gothic*, and the book club will again conclude in an art show in May. The book club will meet twice a month through March and there will also be an online component for people who can't make it to every meeting. [Find more information and sign up for the book club on Push/Pull's site](https://pushpullseattle.weebly.com/book-club-2018.html).

* I asked Maxx, the director at Push/Pull, how she selected that particular book for the book club, and she said she encountered Joaquin through [this *New York Times* article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/books/review/nick-joaquin-the-woman-who-had-two-navels-and-tales-of-the-tropical-gothic.html) last year. "It's a book that has changed the way that I see the world and I'm eager to discuss it with other people," she writes. I'd never heard about this book before, but it sounds fascinating.

* The Hugo House has a pair of opportunities that you should know about. They're now [accepting applications for their Made at Hugo House Fellowships](https://hugohouse.org/get-involved/made-hugo-house/), which is a fantastic support program for emerging young Seattle writers. And they're also looking for their [next prose Writer in Residence](https://hugohouse.org/get-involved/writers-in-residence/). Applications for both these opportunities are due on March 31st. Don't procrastinate, okay?

* *Spartan*, a very good local literary magazine, is [now accepting submissions for its spring issue](https://twitter.com/Spartan_Lit/status/948671918785273856). I shouldn't have to say this, but **please read an issue or two before you submit**; *Spartan* is a free magazine so there's really no reason for you not to do your research.
