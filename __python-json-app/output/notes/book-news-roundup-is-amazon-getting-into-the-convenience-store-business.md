* Jean Riley wrote a great roundup of the state of independent bookselling in Seattle [for *Seattle Magazine*](http://seattlemag.com/why-indie-bookstores-seattle-are-thriving).

<blockquote>The past few decades have been challenging for independent bookstores, with each decade seeming to bring on a new threat: First, there were the huge chains that dominated the retail landscape. Then, there was the shift to online shopping, followed by the invention of electronic–reading devices. And now, the entry of Amazon into brick-and-mortar territory with its first store in Seattle. Yet despite some trepidation expressed by area booksellers leading up to Amazon’s store opening last year, the indie scene here is undergoing a quiet renaissance, as evidenced by the spring opening of Third Place Books in Seward Park, bookstore buyouts and one of the most successful Independent Bookstore Days the city has experienced. </blockquote>

* Speaking of Amazon and brick-and-mortar stores: [is Amazon really getting into the convenience store business](https://consumerist.com/2016/10/11/amazon-reportedly-opening-convenience-stores-dedicated-curbside-pickup-sites/)? Apparently, the online retailer is planning on shops that would function like the"bodegas and convenience stores found in larger cities, offering customer the ability to quickly purchase both perishable and non-perishable products, like milk, meats, peanut butter, and other items." It's unclear if they'd carry books, too.

* Here's a time-lapse video of the New York Public Library's Reading Room as staff prepare it for its grand re-opening after renovations:
