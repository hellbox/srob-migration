Have you read [Sarah Galvin's great review of Michelle Tea's new memoir/novel *Black Wave*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/after-the-end-of-the-world/) yet? You should! It's a wonderful celebration of Tea's impact on young readers that also includes the words "sex millionaire."

Tea herself notified us last night, however, that the review needs one correction:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/seattlereviewof">@seattlereviewof</a> ❤️❗️Though it&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/MattDillon">@MattDillon</a> I fuck in the book. I would NEVER fuck Brad Pitt.</p>&mdash; Michelle Tea (@TeaMichelle) <a href="https://twitter.com/TeaMichelle/status/791455238142107648">October 27, 2016</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/seattlereviewof">@seattlereviewof</a> And by &#39;I&#39; I mean &#39;Michelle,&#39; of course.</p>&mdash; Michelle Tea (@TeaMichelle) <a href="https://twitter.com/TeaMichelle/status/791478105374232577">October 27, 2016</a></blockquote>

This is clearly **the best call for a correction we've ever received**. Thanks to Michelle Tea for being so awesome. We'll update the review presently.
