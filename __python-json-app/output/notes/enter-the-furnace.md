Seattle poet (and [*Seattle Review of Books* contributor](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/25/rattail/)) Anastacia Renee Tolbert read as part of the [Furnace Reading Series](https://thefurnaceseattle.wordpress.com/) at Hollow Earth Radio earlier this month. She told a story featuring the city of Seattle as a protagonist. Now [that reading is available online for free](https://soundcloud.com/hollowearthradio/the-furnace-featuring-anastacia-renee-tolbert). If you've only ever experienced Tolbert's writing in print form, you're in for a real treat; her spoken word performances are absolutely riveting, and she can turn a room into a party, or a funeral, or church, just with just a few well-placed syllables. Take a listen, and plan to attend the next Furnace live. They do a good job of recording all their readings, but recordings can never quite capture that thrill of live performance.
