At her day job, Seattle cartoonist Colleen Frakes [of *Prison Island* fame](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/journey-to-prison-island/)is a librarian. She combined those two worlds in [a (PDF) comic about information literacy and librarian science](http://libguides.seattleu.edu/ld.php?content_id=21567858). There are no fistfights or [controversial twists](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/06/02/thursday-comics-hangover-coming-back-to-captain-america/), but you might just learn something about how to properly source a paper.
