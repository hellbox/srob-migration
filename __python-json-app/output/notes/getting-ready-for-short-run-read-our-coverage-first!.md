Tomorrow is one of the best days in the literary Seattle calendar year: [Short Run happens at Seattle Center](http://shortrun.org/), both in the Fisher Pavillion (where exhibitors will be showing thousands of independantly produced books and comics and art) and at the Vera Project (where programming including panels and interviews will play out all day.) It runs from 11 to 6, and it's absolutely free!

But before you go, you might want to learn about some of the authors you'll be able to meet at the show. Here's all of this week's Short Run coverage in one handy place:

* [Here's our big overview](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/10/30/literary-event-of-the-week-short-run/) of the show.

* We published interviews with exhibitors [Daria Tessler](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/11/03/daria-tessler-is-coming-to-short-run-this-saturday/) and [Tyler Wright Rushing](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/11/01/taylor-wright-rushing-is-coming-to-short-run/).

* Christine Marie Larsen [immortalized author Emil Ferris](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/11/02/portrait-gallery-emil-ferris/), who will be in conversation with Leela Corman and me at the Vera Project at 2 pm.

* I reviewed books that are debuting at Short Run by [Julia Wertz](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/a-city-of-one/), [Anders Nilsen](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/11/02/thursday-comics-hangover-anders-nilsen-is-speaking-in-tongues/), and Seattle author [Mita Mahato](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/adventures-in-the-third-dimension/).

In addition to my panel at the Vera Project, *The Seattle Review of Books* staff will be walking the show at the floor. If you spot any of us, please say hi and tell us about your favorite Short Run finds. See you there!
