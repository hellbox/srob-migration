Imagine your mind connected with others in such an intimate, seamless way that you became one person with many bodies. This is the basis of sponsor Steve Toutonghi's exciting new Science Fiction thriller _Join_. We've <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">got the first chapter on our sponsor's page</a>, and there's no way we're gonna stop reading there â€” and we bet you'll be just like us.

Steve is throwing a launch party this Thursday, April 21st at the Queen Anne Book Company. Come by for a reading, conversation, and snacks. Hope to see you there!

If you're a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, [take a look at our open dates](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/). We'd love to talk to you about opportunities to sponsor us. It's our way of making internet advertising something to look forward to.
