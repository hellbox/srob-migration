<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_New Poets Project_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/896286441/new-poets-project?ref=category_recommended). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Copper Canyon Press](http://www.coppercanyonpress.org/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>Join Camille Rankine and Ocean Vuong to help Copper Canyon Press publish debut collections by extraordinary new poets.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">Three simple words: _Copper Canyon Press_. I mean, how could we not get behind this project immediately? We love how Copper Canyon Press has been experimenting with Kickstarter &mdash; maybe you backed their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/896286441/the-lost-poems-of-pablo-neruda?ref=users" title="The Lost Poems of Pablo Neruda by Copper Canyon Press &amp;mdash; 
Kickstarter">project to publish the lost Neruda poems</a>? &mdash; which is partly promotional, but partly market-testing. Poetry books are labors of love, and nobody builds skyscrapers based on the profits publishing them.
</p>

In this case, using two recently published poets, Camille Rankine and Ocean Vuong, to act as ambassadors to a fund that will publish other new poets is a great idea. 

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">For every poem that you've read and been floored by, for every poet who is a household name &mdash; the Eileen Myles, and Heather McHughs, and Elizbeth Bishops, and on and on &mdash; there is an unknown poet who has yet to have their work printed. Perhaps one of the poets you help support here will be one that creates a timeless work. They could be the one that pens the poem that grabs your spine and holds on for months and years. Here, in this small Kickstarter campaign, is a world of possibility depending on you, but without you, it won't happen.</p>

Plus: poetry books and letterpress broadsides for rewards? Done!

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">They're 42% funded currently, with about $8500 of their $20,000 goal. It's looking good!</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
