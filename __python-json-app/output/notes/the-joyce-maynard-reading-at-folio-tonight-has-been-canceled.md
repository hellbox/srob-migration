The Joyce Maynard reading [we selected as tonight's best literary event](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/30/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-march-30th-april-5th/) has been canceled due to an illness in Maynard's family. We hope to see her again in Seattle soon under better circumstances.
