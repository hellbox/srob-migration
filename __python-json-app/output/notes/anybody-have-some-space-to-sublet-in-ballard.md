Toward the end of Bethany Jean Clement's [*Seattle Times* scoop](http://www.seattletimes.com/life/food-drink/bauhaus-green-lake-closes-ballard-branch-reportedly-to-follow/) about the sudden and mysterious closure of the Bauhaus coffee mini-chain, there's this additional terrible news:

<blockquote>And Twice Sold Tales in Ballard [posted on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10153410672558871&id=132445238870): “Bauhaus Ballard, which my bookstore subleases from, is closing. I was just told, and told that their last day is Sunday. As yet, **I have no idea how long I’ve got to move out or where I’m going to go**.”</blockquote>

Here's hoping Twice Sold Tales can find some sort of an agreement to stay in the space. If you haven't been yet, it's a wonderful little bookshop, cramped in all the right ways and packed full of some wonderful weird stuff. Stop by and show your support if you're in the neighborhood.
