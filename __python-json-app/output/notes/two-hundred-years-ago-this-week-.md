Sponsor Entre Rios books is back. Did you know it's been two hundred years, this week, since Mary Shelley, Lord Byron, Claire Clairmont, and Percy Bysshe Shelley met at Lake Geneva, and spun the stories that would turn into Dracula and Frankenstein? 

But it wasn't only horror and science fiction that came that fateful time together. Byron inspired Shelley, and pushed him to reach greater heights with his poetry. One avenue, unknown for many years, was Shelley's political work, which Entre Rios has collected (in Shelley's preferred order) in a small handsome volume. See a <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">sample on our sponsors page</a>. 

It's thanks to sponsors like Entre Rios, and readers like you, we sold out this season of our sponsorships. We couldn't be more thrilled.
