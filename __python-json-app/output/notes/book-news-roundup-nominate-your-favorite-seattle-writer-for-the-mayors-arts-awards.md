* There's still time to nominate a Seattle writer you love for the Mayor's Arts Awards! You have until May 25th to "recognize the accomplishments of artists, arts and cultural organizations and community members committed to enriching their communities through the arts." All you have to do is [head over here and fill out the form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/7BJVQWJ).

* And if you'd like to be Washington State Poet Laureate, you can [find more information about that in this PDF](https://www.humanities.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/PL-Application-2017.pdf). The position pays $10,000 per year, with up to $3,500 in expenses paid for travel and materials.

* The [*Spokesman-Review* reported](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/may/14/at-gonzaga-commencement-speaker-sherman-alexie-tel/) on Sherman Alexie's commencement speech at Gonzaga University:

<blockquote>“So ask yourself, graduates, and families and friends: Do you want to be the person suspicious of strangers? Do you want to be the person who turns away strangers from your front door?”</blockquote>

* I've [talked about how podcasts were my gateway to audio books](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/with-a-single-step/). I suspect I'm not alone, and publishers are [finally getting wise to that](http://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=528730680:528730681).

* Scarecrow Video published [a wonderful comic by Seattle cartoonist Ben Horak](http://blog.scarecrow.com/fear-rental-a-video-store-comic/) about video stores and horror movies and fear.

* Here's an awful headline out of Washington DC that seems entirely believable: "[House Votes to Limit Powers of First Black Librarian of Congress](http://www.blackpressusa.com/house-votes-to-limit-powers-of-first-black-librarian-of-congress/)." 

* Fantagraphics cartoonist Eleanor Davis was [arrested for protesting the Trump Administration's immigration policy](https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/05/16/comic-book-artist-eleanor-davis-arrested-protesting-immigration-policy-georgia-board-regents-meeting/), Bleeding Cool reports.

* Many of the blogs who migrated to blogging platform Medium last year are [now leaving Medium again](http://www.poynter.org/2017/after-being-wooed-by-medium-some-publishers-are-beginning-to-leave/459998/).
