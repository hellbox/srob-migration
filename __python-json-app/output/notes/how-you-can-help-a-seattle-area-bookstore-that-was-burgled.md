Burglars stole nearly a thousand dollars from the delightful Couth Buzzard Books on Greenwood Ave over the weekend, [reports Phinneywood.com](http://www.phinneywood.com/2015/11/02/burglars-break-into-couth-buzzard-books-steal-950/). That's a lot of money, especially for a store that's still a month away from the holiday rush. On [the Couth Buzzard Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10154303890733572&id=280158903571), owner Theo Dzielak writes:

<blockquote>Some of you have asked how you can help. Well, come on by and say hello, grab a great drink, some food and check out our great selection of new and used books.</blockquote>

That's wonderful advice. Maybe plan a little trip to the Couth Buzzard this weekend? If you buy one or two books, that would go a long way toward recouping their losses.
