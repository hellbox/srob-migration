<p class="intro">On Thursday, October 22nd, Lit Crawl Seattle is bringing you readings from more than 65 authors at 20 different venues. The [full schedule of events](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) is a little bit daunting. How are you supposed to choose three readings out of this embarassment of riches? Let the *Seattle Review of Books* help! Here's our first suggested itinerary:</p>

New literary magazines and publishers are popping up all the time in Seattle, and Lit Crawl is a great opportunity to sample what's out there. Whether you're an aspring author looking to network or a reader desperate for new voices, this itinerary is for you.

**1**. *The James Franco Review* reading at the Capitol Hill Branch Library starts off your Lit Crawl. The *Review* is dedicated to treating every author as though they're worthy of the privilege and prestige that James Franco enjoys every day of his life. *JF Review* ontributors Lena Khalaf Tuffaha, [*SRoB* contributor EJ Koh](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/06/korean-war/), Isaiah Swango, and Leija Farr will read. Editors Corinne Manning and Aaron Counts will host.

**2**. Local publisher Instant Future, the e-book imprint of Portland's Future Tense, presents authors Zach Ellis, Litsa Dremousis, and Tara Atkinson at the Raygun Lounge. They'll each be reading from their novella-sized non-fiction e-books. This event is hosted by Instant Future publisher Matthew Simmons and Instant Future author [Elissa Washuta](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-perpetual-naked-lunch-of-starvation-mode/).


**3**. End the Crawl up at Ada's Technical Books, where *Spartan* editor Ross McMeekin presents contributors Ian Denning, Jenny Hayes, M.C. Easton, and Robert P. Kaye.
