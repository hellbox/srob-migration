The [Twitter feed of Chick Publications](https://twitter.com/ChickPub/status/790604219376033792) is reporting that Jack Chick, the religious cartoonist famous for his pocket-sezed "Chick tracts", has died. His comics were incredibly hateful — they insisted that basically anyone who is not straight, white, and Evangelical is a failure of a human being who deserves to burn in hell — but they were also hugely influential. 

An army of artoonists, ranging from Dan Clowes to [Steve Ellis and Fred Van Lente](http://www.fredvanlente.com/cthulhutract/), have parodied Chick tracts. And for generations of kids from a Christian background, Chick tracts were their first exposure to comics. Lots of interviews with comics pros start with them picking up a strip by Jack Chick as a child and then moving over to Robert Crumb and Phoebe Gloeckner as soon as they're out on their own. I'm not going to say anything nice about Chick as a human being or an artist — he was about as bigoted as they come — but I am going to say that, through no fault of his own, he's had a small role in the creation of a lot of good comics. Which just goes to show that great art can come from the worst, most hateful places.

If you'd like to read more about Chick, [this comic, *The Imp* by Daniel Raeburn](http://danielraeburn.com/The_Imp,_by_Daniel_Raeburn_files/Imp_JTC.pdf), is by far the best resource out there.

And comics Twitter is going to have a lot to say about this over the next few days:
