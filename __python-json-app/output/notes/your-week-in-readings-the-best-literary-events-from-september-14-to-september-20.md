<p class="intro">The *Seattle Review of Books* recommends one literary event for every day of the week. As always, we aspire to a nice mix of national and local authors in a variety of venues. This week, we’re following the suggestion of one [Jeff Youngstrom](https://twitter.com/jeffy/status/641331492690481153), who wants us to bold the author names in this post. What do you think? Helpful? Not helpful? If you have any suggestions, we’d love to hear them. You can always hit us up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/seattlereviewof) [or email](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/).</p>

**MONDAY** [We start the week off with a huge name](https://townhallseattle.org/event/salman-rushdie/): **Salman Rushdie** reads at Town Hall. His newest book, *Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights*, “follows the lineage of the mythical Jinn and their part-human children with fantastical powers.” It’s reportedly a tribute to traditional Middle Eastern storytelling. While it’s true that Rushdie has not written a great book in a very long time and he’s been [too easily distracted by celebrity nonsense over the last decade](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2207095/Salman-Rushdie-memoirs-How-author-seduced-model-Padma-Lakshmi.html), he’s still one of the most important authors of our time. If you’re a young whippersnapper who doesn’t know about [the fatwa against him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Verses_controversy), you should understand that it was a very big deal.

**TUESDAY** [University Book Store](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=09&evyear=2015&eventid=2015071513215100&pre=20150907&pst=20150923) hosts a celebration of a collection of essays from scientists and authors. All the essays are about dirt. Literal dirt. The book is titled *Dirt: A Love Story*. You’ve got to love books that focus on bizarre subjects with a passionate fastidiousness. Contributor **David R. Montgomery** will be reading and signing at this event.

**WEDNESDAY** You’ll want to head to [Hugo House](https://www.facebook.com/events/858072697610644/) tonight for the latest edition of Wage Slaves: Tales of the Grind, which is  a work-themed reading series that launched a couple years ago. Tonight features a doozy of a lineup: ** Bruce Barcott**, **Sam Ligon**, and **Brian McGuigan**, in addition to *SRoB*-featured poet [**Anastacia Renee Tolbert**](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/25/rattail/) and *SRoB* interviewee [**Kate Lebo**](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/exit-interview-talking-with-kate-lebo-about-why-she-left-seattle-for-spokane/), who’s coming back from Spokane just for this reading. Doughnuts and coffee will also be served, as is Wage Slaves tradition.

**THURSDAY** *Seattle Review of Books* co-founder **Paul Constant** — uh, that’s **me** — will be giving a talk about Seattle and the Future of Books as part of [the 28th Ignite Seattle lecture series at Town Hall](https://townhallseattle.org/event/ignite-seattle-28/). I’m petrified of the Ignite format, a Powerpoint talk in which the slides advance every fifteen seconds whether the reader is ready for them to advance or not. So this could be a disaster. Fun! 

However, we have a rule here at *Seattle Review of Books*. If we’re recommending an event in this column that *Seattle Review of Books* is taking part in, we’ll also recommend a second, non-*SRoB* event. We don’t like conflicts of interest any more than you do. So our **ALTERNATE THURSDAY** event is the [Dock Street Salon at Phinney Books](https://www.facebook.com/events/1623741904545726/), featuring local authors **Donna Miscolta** and **Allison Green**. Miscolta is celebrating her new book contract and Green is the author, most recently, of *The Ghosts Who Travel with Me*. They’ll read and discuss their “publishing journeys” for the Salon part of the night.

**FRIDAY** For the last day of the work-week, you should head down to the [downtown branch of Seattle Public Library](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/erica-jong-seattle-public-central-library-0) for a reading from **Erica Jong**. The *Fear of Flying* author reads from her new book, *Fear of Dying*. Like the title says, it’s a rumination on mortality that plays on the title of her classic novel. (She also wrote a book titled *Fear of Fifty*.) Like everyone, I read *Fear of Flying* when I was way too young to appreciate anything but the sex scenes. I have not kept up on Jong since then. But she’s at an interesting place in her career and this is sure to be an interesting reading.

**SATURDAY** Go to [Seattle First Baptist Church](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/richard-blanco-seattle-first-baptist-church) for a reading from **Richard Blanco**, who you probably know best as  “the youngest, first Latino, immigrant, and gay person to serve” as an inaugural poet. Tonight, he’ll be reading from his memoir, *The Prince of Los Cocuyos: A Miami Childhood*, but you’ll probably be able to talk him into reading some poems, too. Though his poem at Obama’s second inauguration was frankly lackluster, he’s a very good poet.

**SUNDAY** The last  featured reading of the week is [The Buddhists in the House](https://www.facebook.com/events/390880491108666/), a special poetry reading at Gallery 1412. Readers include **Maged Zaher**, **Deborah Woodard**, **Norman Fischer**, and **Susan Schultz**. Expect Buddhist-themed poetry and also, because Zaher and [Woodard](http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/seattle-author-spotlight-3-deborah-woodard/) are involved, expect brilliance, too.
