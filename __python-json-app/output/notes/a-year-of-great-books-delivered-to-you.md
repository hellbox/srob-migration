Phinney Books is one of Seattle's favorite bookstores. It's smartly and creatively curated, it's a delight to be in, and it's an active reading and gathering space — their door is always open to Seattle's literary community. They're sponsoring the site this week to let you know about a  program that brings the spirit of the shop right to your doorstep: [Phinney by Post](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/), a monthly (or every-other-month) subscription service. 

I don't know about you, but we get pretty excited at the prospect of having Phinney Books' expert staff hand-choose a year of reading for us. Take a look at [the selections for the last couple of years](http://www.phinneybooks.com/phinney-by-post-selections/) and you'll see what we mean. Sign up for any version of the Phinney by Post subscription program — there are plans for every budget and taste, including an option for children’s picture books — and they'll make your snail mail special again.
 
Sponsors like Phinney Books make the *Seattle Review of Books* possible. It's how we pay our writers and promote great programs like Phinney by Post, and it's part of our commitment to [make internet advertising 100% less terrible](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/). We'd love to feature your book, event, or opportunity on the site. [Reserve a date now](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/).
