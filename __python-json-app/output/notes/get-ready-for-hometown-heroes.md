So this is a big deal: [Hometown Heroes](https://www.facebook.com/events/980701665343279/) is a one-day, free, all-ages comics art show "formed out of a desire to connect creators, readers, and the stories that bond them in a new way." It happens on **April 8th from 6 to 11 pm** at [1927 Events](http://www.1927events.com/) (1927 3rd Ave). I love Emerald City Comicon as much as anyone, but you can't really argue that ECCC gives as much attention to Seattle comics creators as it used to; the show has become a very big, very mainstream event. And that's great! But Hometown Heroes offers a chance for Seattle's indie comics community to show off what they've been working on, which is just as important. This could be the perfect springtime complement to the [Short Run Festival](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/short-run-for-the-long-haul/) in Seattle's comics calendar year.
