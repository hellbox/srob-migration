Writer Chris Offutt reports on Twitter: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, it&#39;s true.  Denis Johnson died yesterday morning.  He was at home, peaceful.</p>&mdash; Chris Offutt (@Chris_Offutt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Offutt/status/867971243089084418">May 26, 2017</a></blockquote>

Based on the high number of mourning authors on my Twitter feed right now, it's fair to characterize Johnson as a writer's writer — one of the greats, a talent so advanced that it mystifies peers. 

*Jesus' Son* has to be one of the best short story collections of the 20th century, and *The Name of the World* is a magnificent short novel about grief and loss and people-shaped holes in lives. As news of Johnson's passing spreads, I expect many people to be pulling *The Name of the World* off their bookshelves tonight.
