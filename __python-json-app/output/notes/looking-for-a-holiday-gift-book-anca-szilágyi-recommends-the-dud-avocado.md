<p class="intro">Every Wednesday between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we're asking some of our favorite Seattle authors to recommend the books they're most excited to give as gifts this holiday. Our first author is novelist Anca Szilágyi.</p>

<blockquote>This spring, I cackled all the way through Elaine Dundy's novel [*The Dud Avocado*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781590172322), the story of Sally Jay Gorce, a 21-year-old American in 1950s Paris who is a delightful hot mess. It's my kind of "beach read" (if I went to beaches) and should be a welcome reprieve from the darkest months.</blockquote>

<p class="footer">Thanks to Anca Szilágyi for her fantastic recommendation. You should attend the launch party for Anca's debut novel, *Daughters of the Air* on Tuesday, [December 5th at the Hotel Sorrento](https://hugohouse.org/event/anca-szilagyi-book-launch). It starts at 7:30 and it's absolutely free. For more information about Anca Szilágyi and what she's reading, you can [follow her on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ancawrites) or [on her website](https://ancawrites.com/).</p>
