The Hugo House has [announced its 2015-2016 season](http://hugohouse.org/upcoming-events/hugo-literary-series/), and [it's a stellar lineup](http://hugohouse.org/upcoming-events/word-works/), featuring terrific big-name writers like Jonathan Lethem, Heidi Julavits, Dinaw Mengestu, Maggie Nelson, and Susan Orlean paired with some of the best local writers in the business today, including Maged Zaher, Sarah Galvin, and Sierra Nelson. 

Novelist Peter Mountford took the helm as the House's curator a while ago, and this lineup feels like a manifesto. Or more accurately, as Hugo House prepares for [a massive demolition and construction project](http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2014/09/capitol-hills-hugo-house-makes-mixed-use-plans-to-stay-on-11th-ave/), it's more of a statement of purpose. Come what may, Hugo House is here, in Seattle. It might have to move for while, but it's **not going anywhere**.
