We love titles that tell you what you're in for (look at ours!). This week's sponsor G.G. Silverman hit the nail on the head with her book _Vegan Teenage Zombie Huntress_. The first two chapters , which we [published on our sponsorships](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) page, left us wanting more â€” and we think you'll love them too. Give it a read. 

We are sponsored by independent writers and publishers who, with us, want to make [internet advertising 100 percent less terrible](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/). Help us create a new model to support the kinds of writing we bring you every day on the _Seattle Review of Books_.
