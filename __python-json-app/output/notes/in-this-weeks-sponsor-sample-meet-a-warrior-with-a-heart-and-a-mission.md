The fabulous [Grey Sun Press](https://www.facebook.com/greysunpress/) is this week's sponsor, and they're sharing a meaty chapter from the fast-paced fantasy epic *Amaskan's Blood* by Seattle author Raven Oak. The first book in the Boahim series, *Amaskan's Blood* introduces a young woman warrior with a bit of a problem: she's miles from home and from her people, tangled in political intrigue, and suddenly unsure that even her name is her own. The e-book is [available on Amazon.com this week for just $0.99](https://www.amazon.com/Amaskans-Blood-Boahim-Book-1-ebook/dp/B00P2ZSGUE/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) — a crazy small amount of money for this much fun.

The excerpt, a boudoir scene with a twist — a potentially deadly one — introduces the warrior's story, though not the woman herself. It's the perfect entry point to the series, with the second book (*Amaskan's War*) due out in 2018, and a very satisfying read. Check it out on our [sponsorship page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships).
