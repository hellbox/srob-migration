Our advice columnist, Cienna Madrid, is taking the weekend off to celebrate Memorial Day and do a little traveling. Hopefully, you're doing the same.

If you have any questions of literary etiquette — from the proper treatment of rude library patrons to what to do about loved ones whose lips move when they read — please drop Cienna a line at advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com. And of course you can always [read the archives of the column](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-help-desk/) right here on the site.
