* Seattle publisher Sasquatch Books was [celebrated as one of seven fast-growing independent publishers of the year]( http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/69573-fast-growing-independent-publishers-2016.html) in *Publishers Weekly*. 

<blockquote> As Seattle independent publisher Sasquatch Books enters 2016—its 30th year—the company points to breakout hits such as *The 52 Lists Project* and *A Boat, a Whale, and a Walrus* as keys to its recent success. Known for its list of nonfiction books, Northwest regional titles, and guidebook series, Sasquatch has branched out into a variety of subjects, including cooking, lifestyle, and children’s books. It launched its children’s imprint, Little Bigfoot, in 2014 and has already built a list of about 60 titles. Little Bigfoot sales grew 13% in 2015, driven by backlist sales, while *Little Kunoichi, the Ninja Gir*l was a strong frontlist seller.</blockquote>

* We already know that [women are under-represented in publishing and awards](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/27/talking-with-nicola-griffith-about-the-importance-of-counting-womens-stories/). But for International Women's Day, Elisabeth Jaquette points out that [women receive no awards recognition](http://arablit.org/2016/03/08/and-the-prize-for-women-in-arabic-translation-goes-to-no-one/) in the field of Arabic translation:

<blockquote><p>Across languages, female authors make up 26.6% of all fiction translations and 29.6% of all poetry translations published between 2008 and 2014 in the US. That means for every book in translation by a woman that makes it onto the bookshelves, there are about three books by men. The numbers for Arabic translations are slightly worse: according to ArabLit’s worldwide count, women-authored works accounted for 22.7% of all the Arabic literature in translation published in 2010, and just 17% in 2014, for example.</p>

<p>Publishing’s gender disparity becomes even starker at the prize level. Women in Translation has tracked women’s low representation in literary translation prizes across languages. When it comes to Arabic translation prize-winners, low representation in publishing turns to no representation in awards.</p></blockquote>



* *Bloomberg Business* [published an interesting story]( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-07/how-apple-and-big-publishers-pushed-e-books-toward-failure) about the aftermath of yesterday’s Supreme Court refusal to hear the Amazon/Apple e-book case, which “centered on whether publishers or online retailers  would determine the prices for e-books.” Did Apple and publishers destroy the e-book market by fighting against Amazon’s proposed standard $10 pricetag for e-books?

<blockquote> There’s a widespread assumption that digital media always wins out over physical media. But even the Internet isn’t immune to the basic laws of economics. E-book sales declined 12.3 percent over the first 10 months of 2015, compared with the previous year, according to the American Association of Publishers, which compiles data from 1,200 companies.</blockquote>

* [*USA Today* talked with tech analyst Rob Enderle](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/03/08/amazons-bookstores-books-just-window-dressing/81453082/) about the purpose of Amazon’s Amazon Books store. In the article, Enderle confirms what most of us have been saying for a while: books are a part of Amazon’s lifestyle brand, but they’re probably not the main reason for the stores:
<blockquote><p> "The books are just window dressing," he said.</p>
<p>Amazon's using them to create a comfortable space for people to come in and get acquainted with its electronics offerings, he said.</p></blockquote> 

* In celebrity news, Amy Schumer's book, *The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo*, will be [published on August 16th](http://www.vulture.com/2016/03/amy-schumers-book-is-coming-this-august.html). Schumer claims via Instagram that this makes her the "First woman to write a book." I can't wait to read this one.

* Science fiction author Charles Stross has compiled [a very long and very entertaining list]( http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2016/03/towards-a-taxonomy-of-cliches-.html) of all the many space opera clichés. Hopefully, Stross is at work on a space opera that will avoid every single one of these dozens of traps.
