1. The Artist Trust Grants for Artist Projects (also known as "GAP grants," even though the "G" in "GAP" already stands for "grants") [opened for applications yesterday](http://artisttrust.org/index.php/for-artists/money). These are "for artist-generated projects, which can include (but are not limited to) the development, completion or presentation of new work in any discipline." That means if you have a project you've been dreaming of doing, Artist Trust **wants to give you $1500 dollars to do it**. And they're giving out 60 of them. So [go fill out a form and get your cash](http://artisttrust.org/index.php/for-artists/money). You have until May 15th, but don't wait until the last minute.

2. University of Washington Press is [hiring an editorial assistant](https://uwhires.admin.washington.edu/eng/candidates/default.cfm?szCategory=jobprofile&szOrderID=143746&szCandidateID=0&szSearchWords=&szReturnToSearch=1). You have until April 3rd to apply for this one.
