The entire literary internet is currently exploding — in a good way, in a *great* way — over ["On Pandering," an essay by Claire Vaye Watkins at *Tin House*](http://www.tinhouse.com/blog/41314/on-pandering.html). She tells a story about a male author behaving badly, she talks about the institutional gender bias of the publishing industry, she tears some preconceptions down to the studs and examines what's left. It's angry, funny, shocking, intelligent and, in the end, hopeful. [You really have to read it](http://www.tinhouse.com/blog/41314/on-pandering.html).
