<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday, April 2:  *Turn This Book Into a Beehive* Reading**</h5></p>
This is a reading for a book that explains bees to children. But that's burying the lede. This is "a book that turns into a working beehive to house a colony of friendly, efficient-and non-stinging!-mason bees." Holy fucking shit!

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday, April 3:  *The Consciousness Instinct* Reading**</h5></p>

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday, April 6: *Songs of Dismantling* Reading</h5></p>
According to press materials, Fernando Pérez's debut collection of poems "employs lyric and nonce forms to interrogate identity politics and piece together a complex family history." Here's the thing: even if the book was bad — and it doesn't look like it will be — Pérez is debuting the book with three great local poets. Bojan Louis, Naa Akua, and Jane Wong will help see the book into the world. That alone is good reason to show up.
