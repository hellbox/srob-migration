Did you know that local celebrity author Garth Stein hosts a book club at Third Place Books Seward Park on the last Wednesday of every month? It’s true! And if you’re going to talk about the relative merits and failings of a book, why *not* have one of Seattle’s best-sellingest authors of all time to help guide you through it?

Tonight’s book club will discuss Brit Bennet’s debut novel, *The Mothers*. It’s about a young woman whose mother commits suicide. Shortly afterward, she discover that she’s pregnant. *The Mothers* is the story of cycles of heartbreak and loss and acceptance and all the shit that mothers hand down to their daughters, whether they intend to or not.

Because it’s a novel about Black protagonists, *The Mothers* might have been shelved in the “African-American Literature” section of a Borders, had it been released fifteen years ago. But the acclaim for this book is universal, and the themes are compelling to anyone who has ever been a part of a family. This is a book that succeeds on its own merits, one of those rare universally acclaimed novels that’s actually worth the hype.

Why not let Stein walk you through *The Mothers* and explain why the book works so well on so many levels? This is basically a master class in reading and writing, all for the low, low price of entirely free.

*Third Place Books Seward Park, 5041 Wilson Ave S, 474-2200, http://thirdplacebooks.com, 7 pm, free.*
