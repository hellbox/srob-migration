**MONDAY** Our week begins with the [Monorail Poetry Series at Fred Wildlife Refuge](https://www.facebook.com/events/450452418475437/).  Local author **Tara Atkinson**, who has a book coming out from Instant Future soon that I’m very excited to read, will be joined by Portland author **Rachael Jensen** and a Brooklyn writer with the unbelievable name of **Sampson Starkweather**. Jensen recently published her first chapbook with Snoot Books, and Starkweather has written a lot of books and also created “a multi-media website of pop/love GIF poems.”  Can one read a GIF at a reading? Maybe you’ll find out tonight.

**TUESDAY** [University Book Store](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=10&evyear=2015&eventid=2015090213151000&pre=20151005&pst=20151021) hosts local sci-fi author **Nancy Kress**, who’ll be reading with **Brenda Cooper**. Kress is reading in support of a best-of collection of her work, and Cooper, who is also the Chief Information Officer for the City of Kirkland, reads from her new book *Edge of Dark*.

**WEDNESDAY** Head to the [Kangaroo and Kiwi pub in Ballard](http://www.spl.org/calendar-of-events?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D116137777) for **Librarian’s Revenge Trivia**. As part of Seattle Public Library’s Booktoberfest promotion, librarians will be a-drinkin’ and a-trivia-in’ it up in an adults-only setting. This is such a ridiculously lovable idea.

**THURSDAY** At a very special setting — “[the rooftop garden of the historic Union Arts Coop](https://www.facebook.com/events/455211804682045/), in the heart of Seattle's Capitol Hill” — contributors to literary magazines *Willow Springs* and *Los Angeles Review* will read prose and poetry. Booze will be served, too. Readers include **Maggie MK Hess, Johnny Horton, Kate Lebo, Sam Ligon, Gary Lilley, Kirsten Lunstrum, Christine Robbins, and Philip Shaw**. That’s a fine array of talent, from new-ish names to well-established local (and [used-to-be-local](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/exit-interview-talking-with-kate-lebo-about-why-she-left-seattle-for-spokane/)) writers.

**FRIDAY** Cascade Writers, an organization that “ brings dozens of educational seminars and workshops to members of the public interested in writing and publishing,” will present a group reading at [University Book Store](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=10&evyear=2015&eventid=2015012012233500&pre=20151008&pst=20151024). Tonight’s readers are local sci-fi writers  **Ellen Datlow, Elliott Kay, and Kat Richardson**, along with mystery author **Tom Wright**. It’s a genre-riffic kind of an evening.

The name of that book? *Punch to Kill*. Delightful! This will be a great chance to hang out with the Seattle Comics Illuminati™ and maybe learn a thing or two about cartooning.

**SUNDAY** As we prepare for the ginormous Lit Crawl happening on October 22nd, it’s probably smart to check out a smaller literary crawl just to stretch our reading muscles. Don’t want to pull an eye-hammy, after all. So it’s good news that [Rainier Valley Lit Crawl](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=525627827590575&set=gm.514219755410687&type=3&theater) is happening, with readers including **Jeanine Walker**, **Greg Bem**, **Monique Franklin**, **Wendy Call**, and **Lindsey Walker**.
