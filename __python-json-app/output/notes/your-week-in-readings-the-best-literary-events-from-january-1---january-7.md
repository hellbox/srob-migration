<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday, January 1: Third Place Books Sale**</h5></p>

Happy New Year! [Every book at every Third Place Books location is officially 20% off today](https://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/new-years-day-sale-2018). I can't think of a better way to kick off a new year than coming home with a big stack of books. Can you?

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday, January 2:  Wayward Readers Society**</h5></p>

This fall, Seattle author and comics writer G. Willow Wilson announced that she’s publishing her second novel, *The Bird King*, with Grove Atlantic. This book club is a perfect excuse to go back and reinvestigate Wilson’s fantastic first novel, *Alif the Unseen*. *Alif* is about a hacker in a security state, and it combines religion and tech and adventure into a thrilling page-turner of a book. Go geek out over it with some potential friends.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday, January 5: David Sedaris Workshop Performances**</h5></p>
