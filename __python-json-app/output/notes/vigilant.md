It’s hard to remain human<br>
on a day when mercy is a frozen river,<br>
when the news informs me tomorrow’s<br>
as bleak as it was yesterday, tells me<br>
yesterday couldn't have left love<br>
lingering listlessly on my bed all eager<br>
hands and doe-eyed, says<br>
there’s no room for beauty in this fight.<br>
Liberals tell me, we must remain<br>
vigilant. We can’t rest, relax,<br>
let down our guard, but<br>
don’t they know I’ve been vigilant<br>
all my life? Yielding to white spaces<br>
like ocean to keel.

I was vigilant when,<br>
in high school, white friends<br>
proclaimed, I don’t see<br>
color, then painted their bodies<br>
with sun, as if skin were a lipstick<br> 
they could apply to the perfect shade of<br> 
not too dark. These days<br>
it’s disguised in praise, like<br>
“what a beautiful mix you are, as if to say,<br>
be grateful you’re not as black<br>
as you could have been. 

I’ve vigilantly guarded my mind<br>
around men who only valued my body.<br> 
Guarded my body from men<br>
who think permission is for “pussies,”<br>
who think a fistful is a proper unit<br>
of measurement. When the cab driver<br>
told me I must have a white parent<br> 
because I don’t “sound” black,<br> 
I vigilantly wrapped myself in my arms,<br>
tried to imagine the sounds he’d make<br>
without vocal cord or tongue<br> 
or his privilege.

Each time someone cracks a joke.<br>
about a black man’s disproportionate<br> 
prowess, about a black man’s "laziness",<br> 
about a black boy’s "good for nothing father"<br>
I want to vigilantly cradle my grown<br> 
brother in my arms and sing him<br> 
something soft and sweet to keep<br> 
his fists steady and his mind right, but<br> 
what right do I have keeping him in check<br> 
when they don’t take the time<br>
to check their ignorance? 

We try our best not to<br>
but sometimes a woman must walk<br>
down a dark street alone, must count<br>
the number of parked vans, must keep<br> 
to the middle of the road, must stay out<br>
of reach, must keep her eyes peeled, must<br>
walk with wide steps, grab her crotch<br>
like a man, spit like a man<br> 
(things they teach teen girls in self-defense),<br> 
must turn herself into something<br> 
a man would never desire, must be<br> 
masculine, be careful, be vigilant. 

So when liberals say,<br>
this is how we fight back, this is how<br> 
we’ll win, I want to tear my clothes off,<br>
walk naked into rush hour traffic,<br> 
cut my feet on broken glass and car fragments,<br>
breathe in exhaust fumes, let the poison<br>
sink into my skin, grow an extra limb,<br> 
heart, head, become something<br> 
un-neutered, volatile, dangerous,<br>
become something able to withstand<br>
the next four years.
