<p class="intro">This Thursday night is Lit Crawl, a bacchanalia of literary events spread over four courses across Capitol Hill, First Hill, and downtown. [You can find the full schedule here](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2017-schedule), but we wanted to provide a few possible itineraries for people who have a hard time making up their minds. Come back tomorrow for the next itnerary.</p>

**Phase 1**: Our first itinerary starts with a choice: are you a dystopian fiction nut, or do you like your sci-fi to be a broader deal? If you like dystopia, head to the Sorrento Hotel for an evening of postapocalyptic stories with readers Apple Plotnick Jannotta, Lynn Adams, and Johanna Stoberock. Prefer a wider scope on your speculative fiction? Saint John's bar is hosting Cat Rambo, Camille Griep, and Caren Gussoff Sumption.

**Phase 2**: Head to ZoÃ« Events on Union for Meredith Clark, Katie Ellison, Leslie Frank, and Molly Thornton for a brisk 45-minute exploration of what genre can do. The copy for the event promises an evening that "traverses across memoir, essay, and less definable forms to create cross-genre and hybrid nonfiction."

**Phase 3**: It's October, so it's time for horror. Ramon Isao, J. Lincoln Fenn, and Evan J. Peterson haunt the house that is Ada's Technical Books with a reading of scary fiction.

**Phase 4**: Your evening of readings ends at Hugo House with a mystery-themed event from Rosemarie and Vince Keenan (who publish pseudonymously as "Renee Patrick") reading from their novels of Hollywood, fashion, and murder starring iconic costume designer Edith Head. 

<p class="footer">Come back tomorrow for another possible path through the giddy bookish Choose-Your-Own-Adventure that is Lit Crawl.</p>
