Local writer Anca Szilagyi just published [a list of resources for people who need affordable housing options in Seattle](http://ancawrites.com/2015/08/20/affordable-housing-in-seattle/). Szilagyi says she thinks about affordable housing, in part, "because I’m a writer with writer and artist friends." This is an issue we've talked about before in the [first installment of our Exit Interview series](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/11/exit-interview-talking-with-kate-lebo-about-why-she-left-seattle-for-spokane/), and we'll be addressing it more in the future. 

If you're an artist of any sort living in Seattle right now — or a bookseller, or a non-profit employee, or, really, anyone involved in the arts at all — rent is very likely at the top of your mind all the time. You don't have to suffer through this alone. Talk to your friends. Look up the resources available to you. Let's keep this conversation going.
