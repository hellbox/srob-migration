Swapna Krishna at Panels has [collected some tweets](http://panels.net/2015/08/31/g-willow-wilson-motherhood-and-the-comics-industry/) by local novelist/comics writer G. Willow Wilson about motherhood and the business of art. Wilson, who's [responding to a popular essay by Amanda Palmer](https://medium.com/@amandapalmer/no-i-am-not-crowdfunding-this-baby-an-open-letter-to-a-worried-fan-9ca75cb0f938), explains that editors and publishers levy "a mommy tax" on writers and other artists. 

As contractors, Wilson says, women artists have "zero legal protection," and the story of her own experiences is a real eye-opener: "I wrote ALIF THE UNSEEN while pregnant and edited it with a newborn sleeping on my chest. Toured while pregnant with kid #2....MS MARVEL? First arc outline handed in 48 hours after the birth of Kid #2. First arc written largely while nursing an infant." Go [read the whole thread](http://panels.net/2015/08/31/g-willow-wilson-motherhood-and-the-comics-industry/). We desperately need child care and family leave acts in this country.
