<p class="intro">New column! Every week we ask an interesting figure what they're digging into. Have ideas who we should reach out to? Let it fly: [info@seattlereviewofbooks.com](mailto:info@seattlereviewofbooks.com).</p>

<div class="break"></div>

[Cat Rambo](http://www.kittywumpus.net/blog/) is a Seattle based writer, and current president of the [SFWA](http://www.sfwa.org/). Her second novel, _Hearts of Tabat_, is coming in April.</p>

<p class="noindent">**What are you reading now?**</p>

<p class="noindent">Right now I am reading [Louisa Morgan's](https://www.facebook.com/CatholicWitch/) [_A Secret History of Witches_](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316508551). Morgan's the pen name for local author Louise Marley, whose work I enjoy under any name.

<p class="noindent">**What did you read last?**</p>

<p class="noindent">I just finished up [John Hornor Jacob's](http://www.johnhornorjacobs.com/) [_Incorruptibles_](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780575123465) trilogy, a wild mash-up of weird Western steampunky stuff with an alternate history where Roman never fell. Highly recommended!</p>

<p class="noindent">**What are you reading next?**</p>

<p class="noindent">Next up is [M. Suddain's](https://twitter.com/suddain) [_Theatre of the Gods_](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780099575641), which the [Guardian described](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/18/science-fiction-roundup-reviews) as "like Douglas Adams channeling William Burroughs channeling Ionesco, spiced with the comic brio of Vonnegut." How could I resist something like that?</p>
