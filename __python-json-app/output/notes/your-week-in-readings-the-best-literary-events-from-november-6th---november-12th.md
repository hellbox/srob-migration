<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday, November 6th:  Patty Schemel**</h5></p>
Schemel is best-known for her years playing with Courtney Love’s band Hole. Her memoir *Hit So Hard* is about addiction and punk rock and what it’s like to play with a thousand different bands but to only get questions about the one with Courtney Love.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday, November 7th: *Cycling the Pacific Coast* Reading**</h5></p>
Bill Thorness is a Seattle author, but he gets around on his bicycle. In fact, he’s traveled the entire 2000-mile journey from Canada down to Mexico. His new book offers tips and tricks and itineraries for aspiring Pacific Coast bicyclists. If you’re not looking to travel the whole 2000-mile trek yourself, Thorness also offers shorter trips of a few days or weeks. Basically, the book covers any level of bicycling proficiency, from beginner to expert.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday, November 9th: *Images of the West* Reading **</h5></p>
Down from Edmonds, photographer Randall Hodges shares photographs he has taken while wandering around the western portion of North America. Hodges will share tricks of the trade and explain why the west is his muse, and not the east. (Though that last one is pretty obvious to anyone who lives in Seattle: the west is dramatic and beautiful; the east is worn-down and exhausted.)

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday, November 10th:  *Fresh Complaint* Reading**</h5></p>
Jeffrey Eugenides is a stone-cold genius writer of novels. If you haven’t read *Middlesex*, you’re missing one of the finest American novels of the last twenty years; you’ll likely be hooked from the very first description of a fire tearing along a waterfront. Tonight, Eugenides breaks a long silence with a short story collection titled *Fresh Complaint*. He appears in conversation with Mary Ann Gwinn, who is no longer the *Seattle Times* book editor but who is still one of the city’s foremost literary experts.
