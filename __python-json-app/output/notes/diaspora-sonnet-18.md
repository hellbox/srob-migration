The workers hum to wile away<br>
the afternoon and tenants chide<br>
their sons to sweep from room to room<br>
last night's dust motes &mdash; stirred dreams<br>
entangled in wide streaks of light 

that, in the daytime, bloom,<br>
unsparing, bright &mdash; like operatic<br>
high notes. Pierced and round,<br>
the clouds of sleep fill us with<br>
sound. A loss. A tune so deep within 

the brain we cannot help but weep<br>
as sons push brushes past door after door<br>
locked tight like eyes and tombs.<br>
Our quiet. Our heavy score.
