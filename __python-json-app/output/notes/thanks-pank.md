Literary Twitter — Lit-ter? — is at the moment (and rightfully) more than a little upset about the news that [literary magazine *PANK*](http://pankmagazine.com/) is going away.

Friend of *SRoB* [Rahawa Haile](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/25/rahawa-hailes-short-stories-of-the-day-of-the-previous-week/) puts it best:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I mean do y&#39;all know how many lit mags have black women as publishers? I just. I&#39;m gonna need a minute. This was always gonna hurt.</p>&mdash; Rahawa Haile (@RahawaHaile) <a href="https://twitter.com/RahawaHaile/status/626596315724648448">July 30, 2015</a></blockquote>

Literary magazines, for the most part, are short-lived creatures. They're born, they live within a certain time, and they're gone. The amount of surprise and shock *PANK*'s shuttering has inspired is telling: we all thought that somehow, against all odds, it would last forever.
