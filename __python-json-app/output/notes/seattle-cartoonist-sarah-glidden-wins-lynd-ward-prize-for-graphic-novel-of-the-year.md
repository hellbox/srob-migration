Heidi MacDonald [at the Beat says](http://www.comicsbeat.com/rolling-blackouts-wins-the-lynd-ward-prize/) that Sarah Glidden's *Rolling Blackouts* has won the Penn State University Libraries' 2017 Lynd Ward prize. MacDonald says the prize is given to "the best graphic novel, fiction or non-fiction, published in the previous calendar year by a living U.S. or Canadian citizen or resident. Itâ€™s definitely one of the most prestigious awards for a graphic novel given out each year."

We've been talking about Sarah Glidden for a long time here on the *Seattle Review of Books*. You can [find our author page for her here](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/authors/sarah-glidden/). I [reviewed *Rolling Blackouts* on its release](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-embedded-cartoonist/), and I [interviewed Glidden about the book](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/10/10/you-need-distance-to-tell-a-story-talking-with-sarah-glidden-about-comics-journalism/) at the *Rolling Blackouts* Seattle launch party.
