* If you follow comics in Seattle, you probably know about Dune Night, the comics jam that happened regularly at Cafe Racer. Since the future of Cafe Racer is in doubt, Dune Night has been on hiatus. But there's no room for a hiatus in our hearts! Tomorrow night, [the Leary Traveler in Ballard presents an art show of some of the best Dune Night pieces](http://www.laskycomics.com/blog/2018/1/14/the-dune-art-show) from 6 to 9. Expect many Duners (Duniacs? Dunes and Dunettes? Artists who have created work at Dune Night?) to be in attendance. The show will be up at Leary Traveler for at least a month.

* Shelf Talk, the Seattle Public Library's blog, [interviewed new Seattle City Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda](https://shelftalkblog.wordpress.com/2018/01/17/city-council-reads-teresa-mosqueda-citywide-position/) about the book that has been most influential in her career.

* Emerald City Comicon is [teaming up with the Seattle Public Library](http://www.emeraldcitycomiccon.com/Content/The-Seattle-Public-Library/) to bring comics education-themed programming to the library on Thursday, March 1st, including a number of panels on how to incorporate comics into literacy programs. ECCC says "An ECCC Professional Badge is required to attend ECCC at The Seattle Public Library. Pro Badges are free of charge to educators and librarians."

* [Bookselling Without Borders](https://www.booksellingwithoutborders.com) is now providing a scholarship to "send booksellers on all-expenses-paid trips to the worldâ€™s premier book fairs, including the Turin Book Fair, the Frankfurt Book Fair, and the Guadalajara International Book Fair."
