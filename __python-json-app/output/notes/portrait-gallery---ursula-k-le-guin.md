A resident of Portland since 1959, [Ursula K. Le Guin](http://www.ursulakleguin.com/UKL_info.html) is an incredibly influential writer, particularly in science fiction and fantasy. She received multiple Hugo and Nebula awards, among many other distinguished honors — despite experiencing numerous rejections at the beginning of her career. Le Guin gained widespread popularity in the 60s and 70s with her short stories and _Left Hand of Darkness_, a novel pioneering the feminist science fiction genre. Her influence extends to renowned authors such as Salman Rushdie, Neil Gaiman, and even George RR Martin, [who lists her as a highly respected fantasist](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/NvYCd6pbQ0wCvvY1PFZdtX/7-bestselling-authors-influenced-by-ursula-le-guin) that impacted his own novels. Le Guin's daring themes — especially that of gender and androgyny in _Left Hand of Darkness_ — admirably transformed her readers' perspectives.
