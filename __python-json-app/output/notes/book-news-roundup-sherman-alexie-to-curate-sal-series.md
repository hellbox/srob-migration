* Sherman Alexie, Seattle's most prominent author™, promoted his brand-new book for kids, *Thunder Boy Jr.*, on Comedy Central last night. He talked with *Daily Show* host Trevor Noah about the problems of being a Junior, Crazy Horse's childhood name, Andrew Jackson, and the name of Washington DC's football team.

* Speaking of Alexie, yesterday Seattle Arts and Lectures made a very exciting announcement via Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ANNOUNCEMENT: <a href="https://twitter.com/Sherman_Alexie">@Sherman_Alexie</a> to curate &amp; host a new 3-part SAL series focused on authors he loves. Stay tuned for details!</p>&mdash; SAL (@SeaArtsLectures) <a href="https://twitter.com/SeaArtsLectures/status/729790791938277376">May 9, 2016</a></blockquote>

* Over at the [*James Franco Review*](https://thejamesfrancoreview.com/2016/05/09/editorial-note-in-response-to-the-sacred-androgen/), editor Corinne Manning wrote an insightful response to the *Antioch Review*'s [horrendous transphobic essay](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/05/05/antioch-review-publishes-transphobic-essay/), accusing the editors of the *Antioch* of laziness and a lack of discernment. Go [read the whole essay](https://thejamesfrancoreview.com/2016/05/09/editorial-note-in-response-to-the-sacred-androgen/).

* [Here is a great appreciation](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/10/theres-nothing-like-it-in-comics-how-love-and-rockets-broke-the-rules) of the Fantagraphics comic *Love & Rockets*.

* As part of her ongoing series of delightful exit interviews, Bookslut founder [Jessa Crispin told *The Guardian*](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/09/jessa-crispin-bookslut-publishing-new-york-literature) that literature had become dull lately because “We all have to be in job-interview mode all of the time. We’re not allowed to say, ‘*The Paris Review* is boring as fuck!’ Because what if the *Paris Review* is just about to call us?” Thankfully, [the *Paris Review* responded](http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/05/09/the-secrets-out-were-boringasfuck/) with good humor: 

<blockquote>Our fabled CIA connections notwithstanding, the Review has always admired those who speak truth to power. That’s why, for the next twenty-four hours, new subscribers can use the discount code BORINGASFUCK for 10 percent off one year of less-than-scintillating reading. Subscribe now to enjoy the best in boring fiction, boring poetry, boring interviews, and boring art.</blockquote>

* It is positively crazy that Barnes & Noble founder Leonard Riggio is [retiring this fall](http://www.npr.org/2016/05/07/476931295/barnes-noble-founder-retires-leaving-his-imprint-on-bookstores-history?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=books). Say what you will about Barnes & Noble, but Riggio has kept it afloat for decades, sometimes seemingly through sheer force of will. The future of the chain is definitely in question now that he's moving on.
