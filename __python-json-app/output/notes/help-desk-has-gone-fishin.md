Cienna Madrid is on vacation this week, which means there is no new Help Desk. Please [peruse the Help Desk archives](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-help-desk/) for your advice fix; Cienna will return with a new column next week. 

And if you have any book etiquette questions, you can always send them to advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com. Did you witness rude behavior at a bookstore? Do deckled edges detract from your enjoyment of a book? Are you sick of people opening their readings by talking about how boring readings are? Cienna can help. Send an email today.
