People! Ask yourselves questions about your assumptions before you make best-of lists. Something like this, from *Time* magazine, is no longer acceptable in 2015:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/TIME">@TIME</a>&#39;s best books of the year so far is 100% white: <a href="http://t.co/kllUcxQtoP">http://t.co/kllUcxQtoP</a></p>&mdash; Amanda Nelson (@ImAmandaNelson) <a href="https://twitter.com/ImAmandaNelson/status/627193126382346240">July 31, 2015</a></blockquote>

Either *Time* is arguing that no person of color produced an amazing book this year, or they're admitting that they're only interested in books by white people. Neither option is good.

At the very least, this is a fine opportunity to remind you to check out the [#weneeddiversebooks hashtag on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/weneeddiversebooks?src=hash), where we're reminded that good books are being published all around us. It's our responsibility to find them — especially for those of us who happen to work in the media.
