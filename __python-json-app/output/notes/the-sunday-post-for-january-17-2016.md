<h5>[How Could The Winds of Winter Be Published In Only Three Months?](http://www.tor.com/2016/01/13/winds-of-winter-book-publishing-process/)</h5>

If you're curious about how a book is made in our modern world, Tor took a detailed look. They were inspired by George R.R. Martin's [letter to fans explaining why his manuscript](http://grrm.livejournal.com/465247.html "Last Year (Winds of Winter) - Not A Blog") for the next chapter in his Westeros saga wasn't going to be ready by deadline. He made the startling claim that if he had the manuscript done by the end of the year, the publishers were going to have the book ready by the end of March.

<blockquote>Book production, from the delivery of the manuscript to the book arriving on shelves, typically takes nine months to one year, so how is it that Bantam and Martin’s non-U.S. publishers could turn around an undoubtedly massive work like <em>The Winds of Winter</em> in less than three months? Learn about the typical book production process below, along with how unique marquee titles like The Winds of Winter can circumvent, compress, and alter that process.

<h5>[The Reductive Seduction of Other People’s Problems](https://medium.com/the-development-set/the-reductive-seduction-of-other-people-s-problems-3c07b307732d#.n2fggfucd)</h5>

Why is it that young Americans seek to solve problems overseas instead of at home? 

<blockquote>
It’s intimidating to throw yourself into solving problems that you’ve grown up with and around. Most American kids, unless they’ve been raised in a highly sheltered environment, have some sense of how multi-faceted problems like mass incarceration really are. Choosing to work on that issue (one that many countries in the Global South handle far better than we do, by the way) means choosing to nurture a deep, motivating horror at what this country is doing via a long and humble journey of learning. It means studying sentencing reform. The privatization of prisons. Cutting-edge approaches already underway, like restorative justice and rehabilitation. And then synthesizing, from all that studying, a sense of what direction a solution lies in and steadfastly moving toward it.

<h5>[Lifting the Veil on the New York Public Library’s Erotica Collection](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/nyregion/lifting-the-veil-on-the-new-york-public-librarys-erotica-collection.html)</h5>

Elaine Sciolino looks at the \*** (triple-star) collection of the New York Public Library:

<blockquote>More recently, hundreds of works that make up the triple-star collection have been liberated from the restricted controls. An adult with a library card can simply fill out a request and peruse the material on the premises. (The library maintains a filter system to restrict access to erotic materials on the Internet.)</blockquote>
