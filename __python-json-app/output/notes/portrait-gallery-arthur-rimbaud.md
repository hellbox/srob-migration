<p class="intro">Each week, [Christine Marie Larsen](http://christinelarsen.com) creates a portrait of a new author for us. Have any favorites youâ€™d love to see immortalized? [Let us know](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about)</p>

<p class="image">![](/webhook-uploads/1476894389033/SRoB_47_ArthurRimbaud.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">Poet and libertine Arthur Rimbaud was born on October 20, 1854. 
If you're a super-fan, you can [buy the gun Verlaine used to shoot Rimbaud](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/gun-with-which-verlaine-shot-rimbaud-up-for-auction?CMP=twt_gu) (non-fatally, in the wrist).</p>

<pre>
<p>
On the blue summer evenings, I shall go down the paths,<br />
Getting pricked by the corn, crushing the short grass:<br />
In a dream I shall feel its coolness on my feet.<br />
I shall let the wind bathe my bare head.</p>

<p class="noindent">
I shall not speak, I shall think about nothing:<br />
But endless love will mount in my soul;<br />
And I shall travel far, very far, like a gipsy,<br />
Through the countryside - as happy as if I were with a woman.</p>

<h5>Get painted by Christine!</h5>

Christine is taking on a limited amount of commissioned portraits, in her _Seattle Review of Books_ style, in advance of the holidays. If you want a portrait of a friend, loved one, pet, or even yourself (immortalize your bossest selfie!) for your own wall, or as the most thoughtful gift you can possibly imagine, [then please do reach out. There's more information on her website](http://www.christinelarsen.com/sketchbook/2016/9/30/portrait-commissions.html).
