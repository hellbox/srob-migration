*(Every Monday in December, we're asking a local bookseller which books they'd like to receive for a holiday gift. Our final bookseller is Emma Nichols, who works at Elliott Bay Book Company and who also hosts the wonderful [Drunk Booksellers podcast](http://drunkbooksellers.libsyn.com/). Emma chose* [Atlas Obscura: An Explorer's Guide to the World's Hidden Wonders](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/book/9780761169086), *by Joshua Foer and Dylan Thuras.)*
