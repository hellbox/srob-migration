* Buried in [this *South Sound Magazine* story](https://southsoundmag.com/newest-arrivals-at-sea-tac-airport/) about new additions to SeaTac International Airport by Kirsten Abel, there's a piece of news that *Seattle Review of Books* readers will be especially interested to hear. A ton of local restaurants are opening in SeaTac over the next few years, but SeaTac will also be home to an outpost of the Elliott Bay Book Company. This move has a local precedent, of course: Portland indie bookstore Powell's has an airport outpost, too. I'm incredibly excited to see bookseller-approved selections at SeaTac, rather than the usual Hudson News monotony.

* Yesterday, I [chatted on Facebook Live with Evergrey cofounder Monica Guzman](https://www.facebook.com/theevergrey/videos/1743560142366780/) about three spring books I'm looking forward to reading over the next three months.

* West Seattle Blog's [Tracy Record wrote an excellent post](http://westseattleblog.com/2018/02/from-macarthurs-park-to-pulitzer-prize-colson-whitehead-visits-west-seattle-high-school/) about Pulitzer Prizewinning novelist Colson Whitehead's visit to a West Seattle high school.

* We're [very excited to hear](http://www.comicsbeat.com/rep-john-lewis-announces-new-graphic-novel-trilogy-run/) that civil rights legend Representative John Lewis has announced a second comics trilogy to pair with his *March* series. The new trilogy, about his life in politics, is cleverly titled *Run*.
