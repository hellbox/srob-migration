<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1452109705843/images.jpg)</p>Brian Tashman [at Right Wing Watch says](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/ben-carson-government-should-spy-classrooms-and-libraries):

<blockquote>In a meeting with *The Des Moines Register*â€™s editorial board today, Ben Carson defended his proposal to crack down on political bias on college campuses by saying that the Department of Education should have the power to **secretly monitor classrooms and libraries** to root out and uncover potential bias.</blockquote>

I'll just come out and say this: if you believe the government should be spying on libraries and classrooms and other places where books and reading are sacrosanct, you are an enemy of America.
