* *Thick as Thieves*, the [excellent young Seattle-based comics newspaper](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/02/16/thursday-comics-hangover-thick-as-thieves-hits-the-streets/), is [running a Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/thickasthieves) to fund future issues. If you put in $5 a month, you'll get five copies of every new issue of the paper. (Admittedly, *Thick as Thieves* is a free paper, but I don't have to explain to you that art is worth money, do I?)

* Yes, Bill Clinton and [literary sweatshop owner James Patterson](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/10711191/James-Patterson-how-the-bestseller-factory-works.html) are ["collaborating" on a novel about a missing president](http://www.vulture.com/2017/05/bill-clinton-and-james-patterson-are-writing-a-novel.html). No, you shouldn't read it. Anything that Patterson touches turns into a soulless brick of commercial fiction.

* In the Fantagraphics Free Comic Book Day comic, [Pepe the Frog creator Matt Furie killed Pepe once and for all](http://www.cbr.com/pepe-frog-creator-kills-white-supremacist-icon/). Furie had tried to do battle with the Trump-loving white supremacists who ran off with his creation, but it's almost impossible to reclaim a symbol like that, once it's been turned into a sign of hate.

* In a masterful show of trollery, Amazon is opening its 13th brick-and-mortar Amazon Books location in [a Washington DC space that previously was home to a Barnes & Noble](https://the-digital-reader.com/2017/05/06/amazon-open-bookstore-old-bn-location-washington-dc/) store.

* In a shitty show of trollery, Amazon is changing its deal with booksellers and authors. In response, an [author named Brooke Warner published an essay](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/third-party-sellers-can-now-win-the-buy-box-on-amazon_us_590b309be4b05279d4edc31f?section=us_books) titled "How Amazon, Once Again, Is Driving Down The Value Of Books And Undermining Authors." That headline is pretty much evergreen.

* Some good advice for booksellers and librarians everywhere:
