moon’s waning crescent like<br>
a grandmother’s toothless smile,<br>
the man at the bar who’s having another,<br>
a sailor writing love letters to a woman<br>
he’s just said goodbye to.

the sky connects my father and me.<br>
orion watches us watch him on a<br> 
september night, the smell of hay<br>
reaches our nostrils, smelling something<br>
so close and looking at something<br>
very, very far away how the senses<br>
bring worlds together how

we fill our houses with plants we<br>
buy telescopes and microscopes to<br>
feel closer to things we can never<br>
touch. 

i can never touch you, you<br> 
are too hot for my delicate fingers.
