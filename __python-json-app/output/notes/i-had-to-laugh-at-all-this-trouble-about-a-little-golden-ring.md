We love a good book review here at *SRoB*, and "[Donald Trump Reviews *The Lord of the Rings*](http://the-tusk.com/2015/09/29/donald-trump-reviews-the-lord-of-the-rings/)," over at the Tusk, is a wonderful book review. This is what we mean when we keep grabbing people by the shoulders and shaking them violently and shouting "BOOK REVIEWS ARE LITERATURE!" This piece employs satire to comment on a book while also addressing current events. [Go read it](http://the-tusk.com/2015/09/29/donald-trump-reviews-the-lord-of-the-rings/). (Also, sorry about the grabbing-you-by-the-shoulders-and-shouting thing. We just get a little overexcited every now and then, is all.)
