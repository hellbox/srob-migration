*Lincoln in the Bardo*, George Saunders's debut novel, has [won the Man Booker Prize](http://themanbookerprize.com/news/lincoln-bardo-wins-2017-man-booker-prize). If you've already read *Lincoln in the Bardo*, I recommend you [check out the audio book](https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9780553397581-lincoln-in-the-bardo), which features an all-star cast including David Sedaris and Nick Offerman as a pair of mismatched spectral friends. I've listened to the book twice now, and I keep finding new things to enjoy. It's like an old-timey radio drama about Abraham Lincoln and sacrifice and what it means to embrace your mortality.
