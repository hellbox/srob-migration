The Hugo House just made their [slate of fall classes](https://hugohouse.org/classes/course-catalog/) available to non-members. There's a lot of great stuff there, but here are a couple of classes to keep in mind from people who have published here at the *Seattle Review of Books*.

* [Anca Szil√°gyi](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/anca-l-szil%C3%A1gyi/) is teaching two classes: a one-day class titled "[Wall-to-Wall Writing Prompts](https://hugohouse.org/store/class/wall-to-wall-writing-prompts-anca-szilagyi/)," and a full 6-session fiction writing class called "[Fiction I](https://hugohouse.org/store/class/fiction-i-anca-szilagyi/)."

* Similarly, poetry phenom [Jamaica Baldwin](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/03/20/jamaica-baldwins-extraordinary-journey-into-poetry/) is teaching "[Poetry I](https://hugohouse.org/store/class/poetry-i-jamaica-baldwin/)," a six-class course offering the basics of poetry writing.
