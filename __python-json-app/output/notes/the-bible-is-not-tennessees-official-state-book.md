We told you about this [a couple weeks ago](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/05/tennessee-to-name-an-official-state-book/), and thankfully [sanity has prevailed](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tennessee-bible-state-book_us_5717bbd5e4b0c9244a7a8f73?section=politics):

<blockquote><p>The Tennessee House of Representatives failed Wednesday to override Gov. Bill Haslam’s veto of a bill to make the Bible the official state book.</p>

<p>Haslam, a Republican, vetoed the Bible bill last week, saying he felt the bill “trivializes the Bible.”</p></blockquote>
