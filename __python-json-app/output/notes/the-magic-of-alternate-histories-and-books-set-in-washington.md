Our sponsor [Julie Manthey](https://heyjoule.wordpress.com) was camping at Cape Disappointment when she came up with the idea for her first novel, _The Magic of Cape Disappointment_. The history of Lewis &amp; Clark permeats the Columbia River outlet, and there are so many things unknown in the accounts of their history. 

One fictional spark: what if Meriwether Lewis had children? What would happen if one his descendents, Kay, returned home to care for family, and discovered strange coincidences, unique characters, and, of course, a man that bears a resemblence to a mysterious character Kay had been painting? Read the first full chapter from _The Magic of Cape Disappointment_ [on our sponsor's page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships).
