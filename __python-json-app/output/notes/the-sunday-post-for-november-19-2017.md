<p class="intro">Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles we enjoyed this week, good for consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that’s your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-sunday-post/" title="Sunday Post archives">look through the archives.</a></p>

<p><em>Guardian</em> editor-in-chief Katharine Viner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/16/a-mission-for-journalism-in-a-time-of-crisis">published an open letter this week</a> about the paper&#8217;s history and commitment to holding power&#8217;s feet to the fire. It&#8217;s a stirring account of the tough choices a newspaper makes — the risks that journalists face, to their livelihoods and persons, when they oppose the dominant political and social thinking. Under the implied heading <em>now more than ever</em>, Viner says, &#8220;We believe in the value of the public sphere; that there is such a thing as the public interest, and the common good; that we are all of equal worth; that the world should be free and fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here are two picks that show a gritty and determined commitment to the same ideals from regional papers here in the United States. Unquestionably there are many more each week that don&#8217;t make it past their local circuit but are heard by those who need to hear them. So don't be jaded, by the echo chamber or the flood of "content" crawling across the internet. In a time (<em>now more than ever</em>) when journalism is at the bleeding edge of financial survival, these writers continue to put their livelihoods on the line.</p>

<p>Topher Sanders and Kate Rabinowitz at <em>ProPublica</em> teamed up with Benjamin Conarck of the <em>Florida Times-Union</em> on this story about racial inequities in ticketing for pedestrian violations in Jacksonville, Florida. Fines are small, but being handcuffed (a 13-year-old girl) or on the wrong end of a Taser for jaywalking is not, to say the least. It&#8217;s impossible not to feel furious or nauseated or both while reading this piece, especially these on-the-record comments by the local law enforcement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In interviews, the sheriff’s department’s second-in-command, Patrick Ivey, said any racial discrepancies could only be explained by the fact that blacks were simply violating the statutes more often than others in Jacksonville.</p>
<p>“Were the citations given in error?” Ivey asked. “I have nothing to suggest that. Were they given unjustified? I have nothing to suggest that.”</p>
<p>In response to the *ProPublica/Times-Union* findings, Sheriff Mike Williams said, “Let me tell you this: There is not an active effort to be in black neighborhoods writing pedestrian tickets.”</p>
<p>Ivey said stopping people for pedestrian violations as a means for establishing probable cause to search them was also fully justified.
“Shame on him that gives me a legal reason to stop him,” Ivey said.</p>

<p>At the <em>Kansas City Star</em>, Laura Bauer, Judy Thomas, and Max Londberg sweep aside the veil that&#8217;s dropped between Kansas State government and Kansas State residents: a child welfare system that&#8217;s geared to protect itself over the children under its trust; police operating without public accountability; the authors of key legislation (abortion, gun violence) protected by anonymity. Any one of these threads could have been a great investigative piece; woven together, an insane picture emerges: government by those in power, for those in power. Finally, something both political parties can agree on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both Democrats and Republicans have run opaque administrations, said Burdett Loomis, who worked for former Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.</p>

<p>“Once you’ve got that lack of transparency, unless there’s something that rocks the boat, the people who benefit from it are perfectly happy to let it be,” said Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas. “Corporations, lobbyists, lawmakers, a lot of these people have no reason to change anything very much.”</p>

<p>The culture that stifles transparency has become ingrained, said Benet Magnuson, executive director of Kansas Appleseed, a nonprofit justice center serving vulnerable and excluded Kansans.</p>

<p>“There’s something about once that culture sets in,” Magnuson said. “It’s really difficult to move out of.”</p>

<h5><a href="http://lithub.com/i-was-already-leaving-florida-when-i-arrived/" title="I Was Already Leaving Florida When I Arrived - LitHub">I Was Already Leaving Florida When I Arrived</a></h5>

<p>Changing tone, but staying on location: In a personal essay that&#8217;s both lyrical and muscular (characteristically, and appropriately for a swimmer), Lidia Yuknavitch talks about catching and gutting fish, and how to finally throw the hook of your childhood.</p>

<blockquote>
I think it might be true that arriving in Florida was a leaving. I was already leaving the moment I got there; I hated it passionately. Those scant years, between high school and college, everything in me was about leaving. I left my father’s house forever. I left my alcoholic mother. I left the boy I loved. I left the girl I was, the girl who did not know a god damn thing, in our garage next to my father’s Camaro. I left ever being abused again — except that isn’t true, is it — I found other fists later in life, I found other ways to punish myself when no one else was around to do it. And, the truth is, I left a bloodline near a sinkhole near my house in Florida.

<h5><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/11/13/the-afterlife-of-a-memoir/" title="The Afterlife of a Memoir - The New York Review of Books">The Afterlife of a Memoir</a></h5>

<p>After 26 years of silence, Aminatta Forna published the story of her father&#8217;s hanging at the hands of the government of Sierra Leone. Beyond the usual intimate disclosures that memoir requires, she dealt with life-and-death questions of security: her own, her family&#8217;s, and that of the man whose purchased testimony led to her father&#8217;s death. A dramatic story and also a thoughtful piece about what conversations the author of a memoir starts with her or his readers, intentionally or not.</p>

<blockquote>
The writer of a memoir must necessarily reveal a great deal about herself or himself, and often about other people, too. You sacrifice your own privacy, and you sacrifice the privacy of others to whom you may have given no choice. They may enjoy the attention or be enraged by it. “People either claim it or they sue you,” the head of press at my publisher told me in the weeks before my memoir was published. I knew who might sue or come after me — members of the regime that had killed my father.</blockquote>

<p>Lili Loofbourow betrays men&#8217;s best-kept secret: they are actually well able to recognize right and wrong. So how did we come to think otherwise?</p>

<blockquote>
Allow me to make a controversial proposition: *Men are every bit as sneaky and calculating and venomous as women are widely suspected to be.* And the bumbler — the very figure that shelters them from this ugly truth — is the best and hardest proof.
