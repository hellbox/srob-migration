There’s this vessel I feel<br>
the presence of all the time. My sister-<br>
in-law sprays a semi-precious wash<br>
of silver beneath her tongue<br>
which is one way to manage. For my own<br>
part I envy the wooden pencils<br>
shot through with graphite, deveining<br>
themselves to the end of every line.<br>
But for the stenographers<br>
everyone do your own typing<br>
seemed a sensible and leveling measure.<br>
They still have their secret alphabet<br>
and their flip-top pads so suited<br>
to it. They took dictation<br>
the way young Mother Theresa<br>
heard God talking plain as a neighbor<br>
yelling through the screen door<br>
that the dog has got out of the yard again<br>
but after starting that new order<br>
and dressing all the sisters in white<br>
cotton ribbed in periwinkle she didn’t hear Him<br>
ever again. It’s not that Wisconsin<br>
is newly rich in silica, which is another<br>
word for quartz, which is another<br>
word for sand, but suddenly industry<br>
can’t get enough of its impressive<br>
compressible strength and tiny<br>
roundedness, which is another word<br> 
for I am found pleasing again. I will pour<br>
most of the glasses of water I will ever<br>
drink. I don’t mean loneliness. I could<br>
impersonate your heart by tapping<br>
on this wiped Formica _lub dub_<br>
until you consent to tomorrow’s<br>
urgent appointment but I hope<br>
it doesn’t come to that. I think<br>
of my prototype &mdash; the prototype<br>
of me &mdash; gangling on<br>
a ledge: the wire limbs<br>
taped to the short cage<br>
of torso were engineered for maximum<br>
slouching, but, too, you could drop her<br>
from the high roof<br>
as much as you want. That egg<br>
would never crack.
