Cartoonist Gene Luen Yang, who is best known for the excellent memoir *American Born Chinese*, has been named [the first Ambassador for Young Peopleâ€™s Literature by the Library of Congress](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/books/library-of-congress-anoints-graphic-novelist-as-ambassador-for-young-peoples-literature.html?smid=fb-share). He'll be great at this gig, and it's wonderful that the LoC is promoting literature to young people.
