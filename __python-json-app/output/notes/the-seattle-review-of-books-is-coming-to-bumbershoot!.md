The rumors are true: we at the *Seattle Review of Books* are incredibly excited to be presenting a show at Bumbershoot this year! When Bumbershoot asked us to program an hour on their Words and Ideas stage, we decided to ask three Seattle-area poets known for their awesome performance skills to share a stage for the first time ever. Happily, all three said yes.

**EJ Koh** [wowed us at last year's Lit Crawl](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/23/started-from-the-bottom-now-were-here/) with her clarity, stage presence, and incisive poems. She's also [published a poem called "Korean War"](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/06/korean-war/) on our Tuesday poetry chain.

**Robert Lashley** is one of the most compelling performers we've ever seen. When he reads, every atom in the room stands still; his fiery delivery and his passionate poems — if you haven't yet read his collection [*The Homeboy Songs*](http://hillarysusz.com/2014/08/10/bellingham-poet-robert-lashley-becomes-a-national-best-seller-with-his-debute-collection-of-poems-the-homeboy-songs/), you should amend that mistake right now — are unforgettable.

And **Sherman Alexie** is, plainly and unhyperbolically, the single best reader in the Pacific Northwest. He's riotously funny and brilliant and he brings his poems to life with a singular energy. Alexie has been reading in Seattle for decades now, and he still commands rooms with his inviting humor and cutting observations. With on-the-rise talents like Koh and Lashley on the bill, Alexie was clearly the only worthy headliner; we're so grateful that he agreed to take part in this show. 

This is going to be a memorable one, folks. What happens when you put three show-stoppers on a single bill? Damned if I know, but I sure am excited to find out. Bumbershoot is happening on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, September 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. [Tickets go on sale Friday at 10 am](http://bumbershoot.com/). We'll see you there.
