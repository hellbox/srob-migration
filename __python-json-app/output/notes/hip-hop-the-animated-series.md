Fantagraphics author Ed Piskor announced this morning [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/edpiskor/posts/10206648029095454) that the rights for his wonderful comic book about the history of hip hop, *Hip Hop Family Tree*, have been sold to Hollywood. Specifically, it's in development as an animated series, and Piskor assures his fans that it's "not one of those dime-a-dozen 'options' you hear about," meaning there's real progress underway.

Is this the first time a Fantagraphics comic has ever been adapted into an animated series, or am I forgetting about a canceled attempt at a *Love & Rockets* TV show? I would love to see Jim Woodring's *Frank* series get adapted into an HBO animated series for stoned adults; given that Woodring got his start in the Hanna Barbera animation studio, it doesn't seem like too much of a stretch.
