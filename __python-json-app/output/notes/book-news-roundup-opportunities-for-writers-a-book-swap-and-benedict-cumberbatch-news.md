**Today's Book News Roundup begins with three neat local opportunities**:

* Are you a poet? Do you want to be Seattle's next Civic Poet? The position, as pioneered by our first Civic Poet [Claudia Castro Luna](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-poet-says-what-the-politician-cannot/), is about advocacy — about reading poetry at City Hall meetings and teaching classes about interpreting the city through poetry. She's done a stellar job and the next Civic Poet has a lot to live up to. It's a two-year program, and the winner receives $10,000 budgeted over that time. Deadlines are due on April 24th. [Find everything you need to know right here](http://www.seattle.gov/arts/seattle-is-seeking-the-next-civic-poet-x70875).

* Are you a cartoonist who's just starting out? You should apply for [Short Run's Dash Grant](http://shortrun.org/category/dash-grant/), which provides the winner with "$250 to complete and premiere their comic at the festival [which this year happens on November 4th in Seattle Center], mentorship by a special guest, access and instruction to local screenprint shop Fogland Studios, a free half table at the festival, and a spot in our annual gallery show. This is a terrific grant that provides up-and-coming cartoonists with a chance to make a big splash in a major Seattle comics and independent literature festival. Deadline for this is April 22.

* Do you know a writer, cartoonist, or other literary artist who deserves special recognition? [Nominate them for the Courage in Culture Award](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Courage2017), which is part of Crosscut's annual Courage Awards. The deadline for nominations is March 13th.

**And in other news**:

* Congratulations to the Seattle Public Library's ace Readers' Service Librarian David Wright, who [just won](http://rusa.ala.org/update/2017/03/david-wright-wins-novelists-margaret-e-monroe-award-for-library-adult-services/) the Margaret E. Monroe Library Adult Services Award winner for "outstanding contributions to readers’ advisory and adult services." Wright is one of the best librarians in town.

* If you're looking for something to do tomorrow, the Phinney Neighborhood Association is [hosting a book exchange](https://www.phinneycenter.org/events/bookxchange.html). Bring in your beloved cookbooks, sci fi/fantasy, mystery, and kids' books and swap them out for some new-to-you finds! If you have no books to swap, they're also selling books at $1 per paperback and $2 per hardcover. It's happening from 11 am to 2 pm at the Neighborhood Center, and it's free to enter.

* Barnes & Noble's third quarter sales [declined 8 percent](http://investors.barnesandnobleinc.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1015498) year-over-year. It's been a long, long time since we've seen unabashedly good news coming from Barnes & Noble.

* Patrick Melrose's exquisite Edward St. Aubyn novels are [being adapted into a TV miniseries](https://electricliterature.com/benedict-cumberbatch-will-star-in-tv-adaptation-of-edward-st-aubyn-books-f55f00c2dfe0#.858hvym62), and Benedict Cumberbatch is set to star. When I read the St. Aubyn books a few years ago, I actually pictured Cumberbatch as the protagonist. I don't know if that means Cumberbatch is a good choice or a bad choice. No air date has been announced, which means it's unclear when we'll discover if the TV show can sustain the book's bitter sense of humor and louche-but-opulent weariness for five full episodes.
