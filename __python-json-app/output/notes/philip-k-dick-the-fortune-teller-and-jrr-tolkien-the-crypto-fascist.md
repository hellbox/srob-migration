The *New Statesman* interview with sci-fi great Michael Moorcock is absolutely worth reading, if just for all the punches thrown. Some quoteworthy moments:

<blockquote>Who really cares about spaceships and how rockets work? I don’t actually care about space at all. You had to plough through all this shit that people like Arthur [C Clarke] insisted on expositing to get to maybe five good images.</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>We live in a Philip K Dick world now. The technology-led, military-led big names like Asimov, Robert Heinlein and Arthur got it dead wrong. They were all strong on the military as subject matter, on space wars, rational futures – essentially, fascist futures – and none of these things really matters today. It’s Dick and people like Frederik Pohl and Alfred Bester who were incredibly successful in predicting the future, because they were interested in social change, ecology, advertising. Look at Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Google . . . These are Philip K Dick phenomena.</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>I was attracted to both rock’n’roll and science fiction because you didn’t know what was going to come out at the end</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>“I think [Tolkien]’s a crypto-fascist,” says Moorcock, laughing. “In Tolkien, everyone’s in their place and happy to be there. We go there and back, to where we started. There’s no escape, nothing will ever change and nobody will ever break out of this well-ordered world."</blockquote>

Oh, hell, [just read the whole thing](http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2015/07/michael-moorcock-i-think-tolkien-was-crypto-fascist). Few things in this world are as beautiful as an old sci-fi novelist who doesn't care what anyone thinks anymore.
