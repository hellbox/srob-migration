<p class="noindent">The title says it all: _Blip_. That's how long we've got, here. When sponsor Ken Boynton was in a nearly-fatal car accident, his perspective changed. _Blip_ was his way to communicate his new-found awe for our short time on this planet.</p> 

See six spreads from this short, [important book on our sponsor's page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships), and take a moment to consider your awareness of this moment. Like one reviewer on Amazon said: "...this book should be read by everyone multiple times."

Sponsors like Ken Boynton make the _Seattle Review of Books_ possible. Did you know we sold out our last sponsorship run? We're booked solid through February 2018, but if you have a book, event, or project you'd like to get in front of our readers, [reach out and let us know](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/). We'll be able to crack open our calendars and reserve you ahead of the pack.
