(Note: This calendar originally had a Seattle Arts and Lectures event scheduled for Friday. That event [has been moved to Janauary](https://www.lectures.org/season/special_events.php?id=484). I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.)

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday, October 25: *Where the Past Begins* Reading**</h5></p>

Back when she was touring for the very first time, *The Joy Luck Club* author Amy Tan was heartened to receive a huge audience at her Elliott Bay Book Company reading in Seattle. She’s packed them in ever since, and even though she’s a bestselling author dozens of times over now, Seattle still holds a special place in her heart. Tonight, she debuts her memoir.

NPR journalist González comes to town with his new book *Reclaiming Gotham: Bill de Blasio and the Movement to End America's Tale of Two Cities*. He's joined onstage by the publisher of the *Seattle Times* and one of the leaders of Seattle's Fight for $15 movement. This should be a great event.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday, October 28: *Pashmina* Reading**</h5></p>

Beloved novelist Roddy Doyle (author of *The Commitments* and the fabulously titled *Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha*) returns to town with a new novel that’s all about memory. One day, an old Irish man who’s trapped in his routines is approached by a man from his past — a man he has no memory of meeting. Is he starting to lose his mind?
