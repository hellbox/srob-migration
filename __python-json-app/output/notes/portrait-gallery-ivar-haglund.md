<p class="intro">Each week, [Christine Marie Larsen](http://christinelarsen.com) creates a portrait of a new author for us. Have any favorites youâ€™d love to see immortalized? [Let us know](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about)</p>

Here's a painting of Seattle's own beloved son Ivar Haglund. Folk singer, restauranteur, accidental port commissioner, trouble-maker, inveterate punner (he's listed as the "flounder" of his seafood restaurant, Ivar's), and of mixed Scandehoovian lineage (his mother was Norwegian and his father was Swedish, nearly a Capulet/Montague situation). On Sunday, come to the [West Seattle branch of the Seattle Public Library](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/01/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-february-1st-7th/) to hear historian Paul Dorpat discuss Haglund's life and legacy.
