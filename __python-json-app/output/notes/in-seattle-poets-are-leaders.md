The *Seattle Review of Books* doesn't run endorsements, but when a writer runs for office, we notice. In case you missed it, mayoral candidate Nikkita Oliver dropped some verses at last night's Candidate Survivor event at Neumo's.

It's not surprising that this happened — Oliver is a teacher and a community leader and an award-winning spoken-word poet, and Candidate Survivor is a nontraditional event co-produced by the awesome [Washington Bus](http://www.washingtonbus.org/) — but it's still **pretty fucking cool**. A major mayoral candidate performed poetry in front of hundreds of adoring people. That simply wouldn't happen in many other American cities.
