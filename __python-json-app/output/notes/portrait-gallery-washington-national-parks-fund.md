<h5>**Friday September 22nd: Over the Top **</h5>
<p class="noindent">This one is a little different: The Washington National Park’s Discovery Group hosts a booze dinner in which scientific experts discuss projects they’re running in Washington national parks. At the end of the night, one of the projects will be funded by pooling everyone’s admission fee in a kind of *American Idol* for science.</p>

<p>*Georgetown Ballroom, 5623 Airport Way S., 762-4999. https://wnpf.org/discovery/ . $25. All ages. 5:30 p.m.*</p>
