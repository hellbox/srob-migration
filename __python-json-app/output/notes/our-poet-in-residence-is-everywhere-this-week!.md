This week you have two chances to see our Poet in Residence, [Julene Tripp Weaver](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/julene-tripp-weaver/), read her poetry aloud.

On Thursday, March 15th, Julene is reading at Soul Food Coffehouse in Redmond at 7 pm. She'll be sharing the stage with other poets including Anita K. Boyle, Nancy Canyon, Thom Schramm, Heidi Seaborn, and Michael Dylan Welch to celebrate an ice cream-related poetry anthology, titled *Ice Cream Poems: Reflections on Life with Ice Cream*. And of course there will be ice cream served at this reading. You can [let them know you're coming on the Facebook Event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1677841348948371/).

And then the next day — Friday, March 16th — Julene will be reading from her latest book, [*truth be bold — Serenading Life & Death in the Age of AIDS*](https://www.finishinglinepress.com/product/truth-be-bold-by-julene-tripp-weaver/), at 7 pm at Open Books. This is a big reading for her because it's the first event celebrating *truth be bold* since it was announced as a finalist in the [Bisexual Nonfiction category of the Lambda Literary Awards](https://www.lambdaliterary.org/lambda-literary-award-finalists/), up against esteemed competition including Roxane Gay's *Hunger*. Julene will be sharing the stage with Seattle poetry legend Tara Hardy. This is billed as a scent-free event, so please leave the perfumes and such at home.

Both events are free. Go out and show your support for a longtime Seattle poet whose work is finally getting some of the recognition it deserves. We couldn't be prouder to celebrate Julene's work on our site in this, a momentous month in her career as a Seattle poet.
