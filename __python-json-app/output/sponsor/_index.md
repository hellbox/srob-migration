<h2>We want to put your words in front of our readers. It's that simple.</h2>

We offer one-week sponsorships, where we publish a full chapter from your work, with clear links to purchase it. We put a very noticeable, attractive ad on every content page in our site. Every review, every note. You will be noticed. <a href="/sponsorships/">Take a look at our current sponsor</a>.

Your sponsorship will go up Monday, and last through the following Sunday. We will put a note up of thanks when it goes up, and a mention on our Facebook and Twitter feeds Monday, then again on  Saturday, afternoon.

<h2>We offer two kinds of sponsorships</h2>

**Event sponsorships** are for readings, signings, festivals, and other date-bound events. We'll feature your poster or artwork, details, and some fantastic promotional text to get people excited.

<p class="noindent">**Book sponsorships** are centered around a work you are promoting. We set our site up so that running full chapters from your work is beautiful, elegant, and a nice reading experience for potential buyers.</p>

<p class="noindent">We can mix and match, so if you're an author having an event, you get both working for you.</p>

<h2>Sponsorships are inexpensive and effective.</h2>

And, for now, they offer a complete buyout of the site. You can find rates, and book a sponsorship, right <a href="/sponsor/book/">here</a>. Use the form on this page, or email *sponsorships* @ this domain, if you have questions. 

<h2>Who are sponsorships for?</h2>

* **Indie Authors**<br>There are so few places to advertise where book buyers will see your work, and even fewer where you don't go through a massive ad network. This is a unique, and elegant, way to get your words in front of readers who care about books. 

* **Publishers**<br>Get the word about your catalog out to folks who will read them. 

* **Festivals**<br>If you want to attract readers to your event, put your ad dollars to target a place where readers gather. 

<h2>Is there another way to support the Seattle Review of Books?</h2>

We're not a non-profit, so we don't take donations, or payments like Patreon. But, if you want to support us, we would be happy to sell you a discounted sponsorship, and use it to talk about a book you love and want to promote. Just so long as you have no financial interest in the book's success, we'd put together a great promo to bring it to our reader's attention, and you'd be helping us pay for the great content you see every week.
