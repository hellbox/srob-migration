description = "The story of a hunted man named Walter who seeks refuge in the no-man's land of downtown Seattle in an old funky warehouse called the New Museum of Indecision and Hysteria and We B Art Gallery. This is where the Vigilance Committee for the Manifesto Party, a leftist libertine crew (free guns & dope for life) reside and hold court. Walter meets Mac, the night-watchman who introduces him to a cast of wild characters as they tarry forth on an odyssey of mad adventures, filled with political intrigue and incoherent vice--into the underbelly of the city; just in time for the World Trade Organization to set upon Seattle as the protests commence and the riots break out."
