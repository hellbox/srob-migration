description = "William B. Gruber, inventor of the 3D stereoscopic device, the View-Master, lived a life as colorful and vibrant as the images he captured in his photos. The story tells of events leading up to his kidnapping off the streets of Munich by the Red Army, his rigorous training as a piano builder, and the lucky break that brought him to America. His political activities in the 1920's caught the attention of the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover, which led to a trial for possible espionage. Later, he would go on to help US forces win the war. Wether filming the Pope at the Vatican, or the coronation of England'"
