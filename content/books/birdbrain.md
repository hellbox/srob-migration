description = "Set in Australasia, this is the story of a young Finnish couple who have embarked on the hiking trip of a lifetime, with _Heart of Darkness_ as their only reading matter. Conrad\u2019s dark odyssey turns out to be a prescient choice as their trip turns into a tortuous thriller, with belongings disappearing, and they soon find themselves at the mercy of untamed nature, seemingly directed by the local kakapo\u2014a highly intellegent parrot threatened with extinction. This is a skillful portrait of the unquenchable desire of Westerners for the pure and the primitive, revealing the dark side of the explorer\u2019s desire\u2014the insatiable need to control, to invade, and leave one\u2019s mark on the landscape. But what happens when nature starts to fight back?"
