description = "Praise for Patterns by Mita Mahato \u201cIt\u2019s part vaudeville, part demonstration of how hard it is to really talk and listen, and it\u2019s entirely beautiful.\u201d -Paul Constant in The Seattle Review of Books Praise for Sea by Mita Mahato \u201cHer paper-cut style, and topics drawn from her dreams, are both compelling and unique. Feel free to drop the common advice not to share your dreams, if your subconscious does half the work of hers.\u201d -Martin McClellan Mita Mahato is one of handful of artists and writers whose visionary work is defining the new genre of Poetry Comics. In Between is a collection of pieces that bring together simple, elegant expressions of thought and emotion with dreamlike mixed media artworks. There are comics that reflect on grief for a loved one who has died of cancer and others that explore ideas of inspiration and surrealist delight. Others combine whimsical word play with visually absurd witticisms. Each work in this volume stretches the definition of what a comic can be, as well as expectations for how much genuine feeling words and pictures on a page can hold."
