description = "Following her moving memoir, Dear Alzheimer's, about living with the gradual loss of her husband, Esther Altshul Helfgott's Listening to Mozart is a fitting and lovely companion collection that both takes the reader through her grieving and celebrates the husband she's lost. From the new widow's first angry bewilderment (you must be busy/ -what are you doing/that's so important) to her gradual coming to terms, she vividly conveys how alive the dead are after they've left us with their enormous absence. -Anne Pitkin"
