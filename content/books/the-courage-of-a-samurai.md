description = "The Courage of a Samurai is a Japanese American's journey into bushido, the samurai's code of ethics. Each chapter features a timeless message about Japanese and Japanese Americans who applied the principles of courage, integrity, benevolence, respect, honesty, honor, and loyalty to overcome life's challenges, and emerge stronger individuals. The Courage of a Samurai provides the reader a look 'inside' this ancient code through the lives of inspiring individuals. Why did Chiune Sugihara, aka the Japanese Schindler, save the lives of Polish and Lithuanian Jews during World War II against the orders of the Japanese and Lithuanian governments? Understand the meaning of Honor in Saigo Takamori's, aka The Last Samurai, determination to preserve the samurai's way of life. Learn why \"Go for Broke!\" was the motto of the famous World War II all-Nisei 100th/442nd RCT, and discover why this simple motto reflects the essence of the way of the warrior. The Code of Bushido can guide us through the challenges we all face, and inspire us to live a life of honor, courage, and integrity in today's fast-paced and changing world. Sharpen your sword, and let the journey begin!"
