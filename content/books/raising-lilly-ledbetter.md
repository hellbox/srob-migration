description = "When President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009, poets Carolyne Wright and Eugenia Toledo felt the need to hear from women about their workplace experiences \u2014 not just pay and promotion inequity, sexual harassment, and intimidation \u2014 but the increasing range of women\u2019s occupations and options in a globalized world. Wright and Toledo, along with coeditor M. L. Lyons, have brought together voices of women poets in the workspaces they occupy: from cotton rows to corner suites, trawlers to typing pools, nursing stations to space stations, factory floors to faculty offices. These voices, American as well as international, bear witness to women\u2019s workplace lives, and act to re-envision and refigure the world of work for women."
