description = "Katy has a rack full of Nirvana and Soundgarden CDs. She's seen Pearl Jam in concert, twice. She never imagined she would be the one behind the microphone.\n\nFrom the book:\nYears later, Katy could remember not only which song was playing--Screaming Trees, \"Bed of Roses\"--but the exact moment in the song where the needle came off the record. The house lights clicked off, and a row of stage lights came on, blinding like L.A. daylight. No wonder so many people wore sunglasses on stage. She blinked her eyes and tried to bring any object into focus, but Megan was hissing, \"Now!\"\n\nKaty's lips brushed against the head of the mic. \"We're The Laundry Room, from Los Angeles, California.\"\n\nOur Secret Better Lives is a novel for anyone who's ever fallen in love with a song."
