description = "This dark sci-fi comedy explores the lost universes of actor Dylan Greenyears. After losing the lead in \"Titanic,\" Dylan exiles himself and his wife to a recently-settled exoplanet. For a while, life beyond Earth seems uncannily un-wondrous. But then a box of old fan mail (and the hint of a galaxy-wide conspiracy) offers Dylan a chance to recapture the past."
