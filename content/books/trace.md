description = "Sand and stone are Earth\u2019s fragmented memory. Each of us, too, is a landscape inscribed by memory and loss. One life-defining lesson Lauret Savoy learned as a young girl was this: the American land did not hate. As an educator and Earth historian, she has tracked the continent\u2019s past from the relics of deep time; but the paths of ancestors toward her\u2014paths of free and enslaved Africans, colonists from Europe, and peoples indigenous to this land\u2014lie largely eroded and lost.\n\nIn this provocative and powerful mosaic of personal journeys and historical inquiry across a continent and time, Savoy explores how the country\u2019s still unfolding history, and ideas of \u201crace,\u201d have marked her and the land. From twisted terrain within the San Andreas Fault zone to a South Carolina plantation, from national parks to burial grounds, from \u201cIndian Territory\u201d and the U.S.-Mexico Border to the U.S. capital, Trace grapples with a searing national history to reveal the often unvoiced presence of the past.\n\nIn distinctive and illuminating prose that is attentive to the rhythms of language and landscapes, she weaves together human stories of migration, silence, and displacement, as epic as the continent they survey, with uplifted mountains, braided streams, and eroded canyons. Gifted with this manifold vision, and graced by a scientific and lyrical diligence, she delves through fragmented histories -- natural, personal, cultural -- to find shadowy outlines of other stories of place in America.\n\n\"Every landscape is an accumulation,\" reads one epigraph. \"Life must be lived amidst that which was made before.\" Courageously and masterfully, Lauret Savoy does so in this beautiful book: she lives there, making sense of this land and its troubled past, reconciling what it means to inhabit terrains of memory\u2014and to be one."
