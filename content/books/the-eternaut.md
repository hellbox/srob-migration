description = "For the first time in English, this seminal Argentinian science fiction graphic novel whose main character is still viewed as a symbol of resistance in Latin America. This originally appeared as weekly installments from 1957-59. Juan Salvo, the inimitable protagonist, along with his friend Professor Favalli and the tenacious metal-worker Franco, face what appears to be a nuclear accident, but quickly turns out to be something much bigger than they had imagined. Cold War tensions, aliens of all sizes, space\u2015and time travel\u2015this one has it all."
