description = "The After is a new long poem by Seattle poet, Melinda Mueller, sorrowing the world we are altering and will leave unseen. A meditation on the current sixth extinction and the anthropocene, it blends science and poetry with the urgency of a heartbreak. Published in full color, it features the stunning Arctic prints of Alaskan printmaker, Karinna Gomez, and also ships with a CD with music commissioned for the book by the Seattle-based experimental jazz duo Syrinx Effect. The CD also includes a reading of the work by Melinda Mueller and the field call of an extinct sparrow. This is an important new work by Northwest artists responding to climate change and the corresponding mass extinction now underway."
