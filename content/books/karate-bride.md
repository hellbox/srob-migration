description = "Karate Bride is Nicole Sarrocco's first full-length collection of poetry. She is a North Carolina native whose work reflects a family life that is at times familiar and at times eccentric. Flavored with events and memories from her home state, Ms. Sarrocco's work blends idiom and image in a straightforward manner sure to appeal to poetry lovers - and to surprise people who think they do not like poetry. Or the South.\nHer screenplays Answers to Lucky and Motel Canterbury were selected for the final round of competition in the Sundance Feature Film Program for its labs in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Deflowered in the Attic, a satirical play based on several works of teenage gothic fiction, enjoyed several successful runs in Seattle and an off-off-Broadway New York preview. The play was honored with a Footlight Award from the Seattle Times as Best of the Fringe.\n\nVaried travels and years of working a series of any odd or mundane jobs that might occasion the telling of a story have given her a deep appreciation of her roots, as well as an assortment of experiences, personalities, and curiosities to mine."
