description = "In this superb work of literary true crime\u2014a spellbinding combination of memoir and psychological suspense\u2014a female journalist chronicles her unusual connection with a convicted serial killer and her search to understand the darkness inside us. \"Well, well, Claudia. Can I call you Claudia? I\u2019ll have to give it to you, when confronted at least you\u2019re honest, as honest as any reporter. . . . You want to go into the depths of my mind and into my past. I want a peek into yours. It is only fair, isn\u2019t it?\"\u2014Kendall Francois In September 1998, young reporter Claudia Rowe was working as a stringer for the New York Times in Poughkeepsie, New York, when local police discovered the bodies of eight women stashed in the attic and basement of the small colonial home that Kendall Francois, a painfully polite twenty-seven-year-old community college student, shared with his parents and sister. Growing up amid the safe, bourgeois affluence of New York City, Rowe had always been secretly fascinated by the darkness, and soon became obsessed with the story and with Francois. She was consumed with the desire to understand just how a man could abduct and strangle eight women\u2014and how a family could live for two years, seemingly unaware, in a house with the victims\u2019 rotting corpses. She also hoped to uncover what humanity, if any, a murderer could maintain in the wake of such monstrous evil. Reaching out after Francois was arrested, Rowe and the serial killer began a dizzying four-year conversation about cruelty, compassion, and control; an unusual and provocative relationship that would eventually lead her to the abyss, forcing her to clearly see herself and her own past\u2014and why she was drawn to danger."
