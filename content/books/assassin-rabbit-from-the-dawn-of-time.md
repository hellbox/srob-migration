description = "Conducting unlicensed medical experiments on your friends is never the right thing to do. When Astrid and Alan unexpectedly find themselves on the wrong end of this common sense rule they discover a secret as old as the universe, a secret previously known to only a small group of very old friends - who would like to invite them in for coffee at a small cafe beside a flooding river somewhere north of Everett, Washington. Alan and Astrid have urgent questions but their friends don't seem to know the answers, or just don't care. They have a hard time paying attention. How much danger are they in, really? Assassin Rabbit is a unique tale of the American West and of a singularity with no artificial intelligence of any kind."
