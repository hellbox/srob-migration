description = "Two young girls are abducted and held hostage by a band of religious fanatics. The girls' anxious father, a politician on the eve of an important election, has reasons of his own not to go to the police, so hires a pair of shady private eyes to investigate. All the elements of a classic noir- except that the kidnapped girls are mice, the abductors are Sunshine Family dolls, and the detectives are Barbie and Ken. Elect H. Mouse State Judge is an unusual and masterful blend of irony and tenderness, and a moving portrayal of a father trying and failing to do the right thing."
