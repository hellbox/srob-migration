A Filipino restaurant is bone marrow<br>
and vinegar boiling<br>
perfectly over the sound<br>
of the most dramatic Tagalog<br> 
soap opera you’ve ever been forced to watch. 

I come here, when I can afford it,<br>
when my homesick can only be cured<br>
by my mother’s hands

The server is a young woman,<br>
possibly in her 20’s with a posture<br>
that’s been carrying the weight of her father’s expectations. 

She calls me, “Ate” every time I come in.<br>
It means older sister in Tagalog.  

I can tell by the way she responds<br>
to her mother that she still lives at home,<br>
because Filipino women without husbands<br>
have no business being out on their own,<br>
she wears a crucifix on her necklace<br>
to remind her a man died for her once,<br>
her priest, her mother,<br>
her father, and her aunties<br>
won’t ever let her forget it.  

And she doesn’t know.<br>
But I’ve been there.<br>
Wanted to believe that<br>
I could behave and sit still.<br>
Find a nice boy to marry<br>
to shut my mom up and wear tradition<br>
and religion on my wedding day, 

but I needed to be free.  

And I wonder what young women<br>
like this know about freedom.<br>
What it’s like to not have a predetermined destiny.<br>
To not always have to say the right thing,<br>
and dress the right way<br>
and be the dream<br>
that someone else dreamed for you. 

But this glass house<br> 
contains a boy<br>
with too many stones<br>
and not enough heart 
to tell his mother he’s trans.<br>
Because I swore I would never tell my mother.<br>
Because she wouldn’t understand. 

Because this is will make the pot boil over.<br>
And this young woman could’ve been my mother in past life 

The woman behind the counter says,<br>
“Hi Ate.  how are you today?”

I smile.<br>
Hold back my painful desire<br>
to tell her I’m different now.<br> 
I went and got free.<br>
I am not your sister,<br>
but I’m still part of the family.<br>
But the smell of this adobo<br>
is whispering my mother’s name<br>
and I can’t unclench.  

My mother grips tradition<br>
and Catholicism so tightly<br>
she has no more knuckles for this. 

I do not correct her.<br>
Continue this transaction like we normally would.

Do not try to axe at the root<br>
of this family tree we swing under<br>
I decide to never tell my mother<br>
I can’t be her daughter<br>
Do not throw these stones from your glass house, boy<br>
the only chain you have left<br>
Don’t anger your ancestors<br>
Don’t shame this family _anymore_<br>
Do not come out _again_<br>
Don’t do this to _us_

So, I do not correct her.

Instead I settle into this excuse<br>
rather not uproot this tree from the ground

Rather not show her that she might be the one who is free

and 

not me

We complete our business and she says, “Thanks Ate”<br>
But I’ve been used to being free for too long.<br>
My jaw shakes loose of the weight it’s been holding<br>
dislocates from my mouth<br>
and drops into the young woman’s hands

“Kuya” I say.<br>
which is a respectful title for<br>
“older brother”.

I do not expect her to catch me.<br>
My muscle memory braces itself for the shatter<br>
for the shards of stained glass<br>
church windows I’ve just smashed.

She says, “Have I been saying it wrong this whole time?”

And this is where I have to come out again.<br>
A decision to make to erase the history we’ve created together in our connection<br>
to erase my own history<br>
or to be loyal to who I’ve been 

I choose to be loyal.

I say, “no.”<br>
Wait for the confusion, the hate, the back turned that I know so well

She says, “_Oh, Sige—Kuya_”

I smile.

And wonder how I will tell my mother that I am still her child.
