This week, the *Seattle Review of Books* is sponsored by Paul Mullin, playwright, poet, and creator/curator of the Loud Mouth Lit reading series. We're infinitely grateful to Paul for supporting the site and for [sharing a chapter from his memoir, *The Starting Gate*, with our readers](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/). The excerpt is a great standalone story: the down-and-dirty (or up-and-clean) on the dangers of washing windows on a New York highrise when you're a young writer with three jobs and no time to sleep. And it's an irresistible entry point for Mullin's no-holds-barred style.

Buy a copy of *The Starting Gate* [here](https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Gate-Cocktail-Working-Drinking-ebook/dp/B01B13Y8YI). Or come out for this month's edition of Loud Mouth Lit, at St. Andrew's Bar on Tuesday night, to hear Mullin read — Lindy West is also on the marquee, so it should be a brilliant night for anger done funny — and pick up a copy while you're there.

Sponsors like Paul Mullin make the *Seattle Review of Books* possible. Did you know [you could sponsor us, as well](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/)? Slots for spring and summer 2018 are open now and going fast. If you have a book, event, or opportunity you’d like to get in front of our readers, [reserve your dates now](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/).
