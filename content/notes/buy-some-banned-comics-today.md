This month's [Humble Bundle features a whole passel of comics that have been banned](https://www.humblebundle.com/books?logo&utm_source=Humble+Bundle+Newsletter&utm_campaign=a0fd2ae9dc-Humble_Comics_Bundle_Forbidden&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_990b1b6399-a0fd2ae9dc-124184005&mc_cid=a0fd2ae9dc&mc_eid=514ad8e277). (In case you're not familiar with the premise, the Humble Comics Bundle offers e-book editions of comics for a single low price, with a set-your-own-amount of that price going directly to charity.) A lot of the books in this Bundle are first volumes of great series — *Bone*, *Barefoot Gen* — and others are wonderful standalone comics from artists like Julie Doucet, Leah Hayes, Chester Brown, and Jim Woodring. At least one of them is outright terrible — Garth Ennis's *The Boys* was an awful dirty joke of a comic that unjustly tied up artist Darick Robertson for way, wayyyy too long. Still, if *The Boys* is the worst book in there, I like them odds.
