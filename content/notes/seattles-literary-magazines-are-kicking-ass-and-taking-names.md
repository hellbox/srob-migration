Today, local literary magazine *The James Franco Review*, which treats every submission as though it was written by James Franco, [started rolling out an "Emergency Issue"](http://thejamesfrancoreview.com/2015/09/02/an-emergency-issue-art-and-engagement/) on art and engagment. What does that mean? 

<blockquote>Writers, editors, and artists around the country explored what it meant for them to be politically or consciously engaged in their work and to also examine literature’s relationship to safety.</blockquote>

The first piece, by Nancy Jooyoun Kim, is [live now](http://thejamesfrancoreview.com/2015/09/15/safe-and-sound-by-nancy-jooyoun-kim/), and it's powerful stuff, about her own experience with a white writer who workshopped a story with a black protagonist. 

<blockquote> Someone “hinted” at the “potential” problem of the protagonist’s race.

That was enough for the writer to decide to make the character white. It’d be easier.

A wave of relief washed over the room.</blockquote>

I'm so excited for this "Emergency Issue." And I love the idea of an Emergency Issue, too. It makes the act of publication so urgent and relevant. Go [give the *JF Review* your attention](http://thejamesfrancoreview.com/2015/09/15/safe-and-sound-by-nancy-jooyoun-kim/).

And while we're talking about awesome local literary magazines, the *Moss* Kickstarter has already met its goal with 21 days left to go. If you're interested in owning an attractive print anthology of Northwest writing, you can [go buy a copy for $10 and up](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ajdl/moss-volume-one-a-print-anthology-of-northwest-wri?ref=category). *Moss* [generously makes their magazine available for free online](http://www.mosslit.com/vol01/issue03_kickstart.html), and this is a way to invest in the magazine's future.
