<p class="intro">Every week, the _Seattle Review of Books_ backs a Kickstarter, and writes up why we picked that particular project. <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/08/announcing-the-seattle-review-of-books-kickstarter-fund/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Announcing the Seattle Review of Books Kickstarter Fund">Read more about the project here</a>. Suggest a project by writing to _kickstarter_ at this domain, or by <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - About the Seattle Review of Books">using our contact form</a>.<p>

<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">_[Rosarium Publishing: The Next Level](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/rosarium-publishing-the-next-level#/)_. We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Rosarium Publishing](	
http://rosariumpublishing.com).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>Publisher of diverse books and comics. Help us expand so we can deliver more of what you love.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">We're well aware of Rosarium, at the _Seattle Review of Books_. Their anthology about Samuel R. Delaney _Stories for Chip_ was co-edited by Seattle writer Nisi Shawl, and included work by local SF writers Eileen Gunn and L. Timmel DuChamp. The great anthology _Mothership: Tales from Afrofuturism and Beyond_ was co-edited by Edward Austin Hall, who you may remember around these parts from [his review of Matt Ruff's _Lovecraft Country_](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/caught-after-dark-in-lovecraft-country/).
</p>

The work this publisher puts out is so impressive. It's incredibly diverse, both in the sense of representation, but also in the sense that they publish novels and comics, steampunk to science fiction. The berth of their spaceship is huge, and the quality of the work is wonderful. 

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">To see more from publishers like Rosarium. Like many presses, they were started in the spare time of their founders, in this case, Bill Campbell. He started the press on a shoestring, and now has many titles in print. But still, it's a part time gig supported by his day job.</p>

This fundraiser &mdash; on IndieGoGo this week, not Kickstarter &mdash; would allow them some capital to start printing offset, instead of on-demand, and if they raise enough they'll be able to hire a publicist to help with getting the word out about future releases.

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">They need our help! They're less than $12k to their $40k goal, and time is running low &mdash; twelve days! Time to raise the alarm and circle the wagons. This is a great project to put a few ducats in, and the rewards are great books.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
