* [Town Hall Seattle is looking](https://townhallseattle.org/in-residence/) for artists and scholars in residence. But because Town Hall (the building) is being renovated this year and Town Hall (the organization) is branching out into other neighborhoods, they're doing something a little different. Each of the four neighborhoods that Town Hall is using as home bases during their Inside/Out Program — Phinney/Greenwood; University District/Ravenna; Capitol Hill/Central District; Columbia City/Hillman City — will have its own artist in residence. Those residents will then program Town Hall events within their communities, in exchange for a $5000 stipdend. This is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. Submit to Town Hall by December 10th, okay?

* Penguin childrens' book designer Giusseppe Castellano left the publisher under a cloud after being accused of harassing comedian Charlene Yi, who was pitching projects to the publisher. Castellano then released a statement claiming that Yi's complaints were "false." But Yi brought receipts:

* Related: if you have experienced harassment in childrens' book publishing, [here's a survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiUu6-zb64bitRlby8Gbf_gZwoK-brshGLfgSV2EPD2sKotQ/viewform) that's intended to help "get a handle on the scope of the problem."

* Don't fuck with Joan Didion, because she will [murder you with two words](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1979/10/11/theyll-take-manhattan-3/).

* And Eileen Myles is taking none of your bullshit, either:
