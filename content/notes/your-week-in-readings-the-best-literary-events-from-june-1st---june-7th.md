<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday June 5: *King of the Worlds* Reading**</h5></p>
M. Thomas Gammarino’s new book from Seattle publisher Chin Music Press is a hyperactive science fiction road trip about an actor who loses the lead role in *Titanic* and then travels across time and space in the throes of a “trans-dimensional midlife crisis.” After his reading, I’ll be joining Gammarino for a talk.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Alternate Sunday June 5: *The Face: A Time Code* Reading**</h5></p>
[Ruth Ozeki’s *A Time Code*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/open-faced/) is the best of three debut books in the new series *The Face*, in which authors write book-length essays about their own faces. (I [reviewed it a few months ago](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/open-faced/).) In her outing, Ozeki stares at her own face in the mirror for hours at a time, and records her reaction. It’s a story about meditation, vanity, gender, and aging, from one of the best writers in the Northwest.

Moon’s publisher compares him to Kafka or Beckett, and this is an incredibly rare stateside appearance. *Seattle Asian Art Museum, 1400 E. Prospect, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com. Free.
