* Mary Ann Gwinn [at the *Seattle Times* offers an in-depth preview](http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/seward-park-meet-your-new-bookstore/) of Third Place Books' new Seward Park store, which will open in late April.

* Seattle author Lesley Hazleton's upcoming book on agnosticism, *Agnostic: A Spirited Manifesto*, has earned [two places of pride in the most recent issue of *Publishers Weekly*](https://accidentaltheologist.com/2016/02/10/two-thumbs-up-for-agnostic/). Hazleton's book received a starred review praising "her appealing voice and accessible prose," and it was also chosen as a most-anticipated book of the spring. *Agnostic* is due out this April, and we can't wait.

* The award-winning *Ms. Marvel* comic written by Seattle writer G. Willow Wilson has been nominated for another award â€” this time, it's up for [the Dwayne McDuffie Award for Diversity in Comics](http://comicsalliance.com/mcduffie-award-nominees/). McDuffie was a giant in the comics world and a champion for diversity in a time when it seemed as though comics would always be the province of straight white dudes, so this is a real honor. Congratulations to Wilson, and a recommendation to our readers: the most recent issue of *Ms. Marvel*, which hit comics stands yesterday, might be her best yet.

* Seattle cartoonist Tom Van Deusen has a pretty great autobiographical comic in this week's *Seattle Weekly* about Seattle's housing crisis. You [really should go read it](http://www.seattleweekly.com/home/962989-129/scene-report-housing-in-seattle).

* Some bad news for authors that we found in the [Melboure, Austrailia newspaper *The Age*](http://www.theage.com.au/comment/falling-book-prices-could-force-authors-to-abandon-their-keyboards-20160207-gmo386.html):

<blockquote>Recent surveys in Britain, the United States and Australia have revealed a serious slump in the income that authors receive from their writing. In Australia, authors have seen their average income from writing decrease from about $22,000 in the early 2000s to less than $13,000 in 2015. For many authors, that means they can no longer earn a livelihood from their work.</blockquote>

* And because it's always better to end on a weird note than a bad note: Amy Brady has published a remarkable interview with the founders of the dark web's first literary magazine [over at Literary Hub](http://lithub.com/bringing-literature-to-the-dark-web/?utm_content=buffer8e963&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer).
