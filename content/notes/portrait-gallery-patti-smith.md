<p class="intro">Each week, [Christine Larsen](http://christinelarsen.com) creates a portrait of a new author for us. Have any favorites you’d love to see immortalized? [Let us know](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about)</p>

<p class="image">![](/webhook-uploads/1447956665282/SRoB_10_PattiSmith.jpg)</p>

Patti Smith talks about her new book _M Train_ [this Sunday at Town Hall](https://townhallseattle.org/event/patti-smith/). It’s sold out. If you didn’t get tickets, perhaps you could listen to [_Horses_](https://open.spotify.com/album/7xg7u99lilTCPbaRfnYuy6) on repeat while watching [_Robert Having His Nipple Pierced_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0256342/). We do love Patti Smith.
