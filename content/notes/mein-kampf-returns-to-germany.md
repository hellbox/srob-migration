[Galleycat says](http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/hitlers-mein-kampf-will-return-to-germany-after-70-year-ban/114309):

<blockquote>Adolf Hitler’s anti-Semitic manifesto *Mein Kampf* has been banned from Germany for 70 years, but will return to German bookstores next month.</blockquote>

So many factors are at play here — atrocity, history, copyright, the free exchange of ideas — that really all we can do is wait and watch what happens. Will German bookstores carry *Mein Kampf*? Will people buy it? What happens when the most hateful, reviled, and influential book in the history of a nation becomes readily available again? We'll find out in 2016.
