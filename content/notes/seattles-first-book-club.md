Over at Crosscut, Knute Berger reports back on a little archaeological digging he did into Seattle's book history. He believes he may have found [a record from Seattle's very first Library](http://crosscut.com/2015/10/seattles-first-reading-list/). Go read the essay, which began as a speech Berger delivered at an event celebrating [Seattle's newest library, Folio Seattle](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/24/opening-the-folio/).
