Today is the publication date for the new book by Ta-Nehisi Coates, *We Were Eight Years in Power*. It's a collection of essays which have previously been published in *The Atlantic*, along with eight new essays that look back on each year of the Obama presidency. 

If you're missing Obama right now, this might be the book for you. And of course, this book is a big deal because it's the first Coates book to be published since [his breakout sensation *Between the World and Me*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-seattle-of-your-nightmares/). It's hard to imagine another book having the impact of *World*, but Coates has basically become a household name, and so this is the book everyone is sure to be talking about for the next few weeks.

Coates is right now on a promotional tour for the book. Last night, he appeared in [a good (albeit brief) interview on *Pod Save America*](http://art19.com/shows/pod-save-america/episodes/82bb27c0-45ac-4c35-8c54-d41e209d1232), and he's also the subject of [a very good *New York Times* profile](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/books/ta-nehisi-coates-we-were-eight-years-in-power.html?_r=0).
