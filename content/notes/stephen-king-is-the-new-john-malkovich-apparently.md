This year's Black List Awards, which celebrate the greatest unproduced screenplays, were announced yesterday. Coincidentally, two Black List winners share a very interesting muse. Here's a description of Kathy Charles's screenplay *The Kings of Maine*:

<blockquote>Living with his wife and child in a trailer while working as a janitor, Stephen King struggles with alcoholism and his own dark history as he attempts to complete Carrie.</blockquote>

And here's the plot synopsis for *Maximum King!*, by Shay Hatten:

<blockquote>An outlandish, surreal imagining of how in 1985 Stephen King wrote and directed his horror classic MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE.</blockquote>

We could be about to enter a Stephen King renaissance; from biopics to absurdist comedy, something about King is in the zeitgeist right now.
