We are so excited that [Brianna Wu](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/brianna-wu/) is [running for Congress in 2018](http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/21/14041542/brianna-wu-congress-campaign-gamergate-harassment) and we hope that she's the first of many *Seattle Review of Books* contributors to run for public office. (I'd love to vote for Mayor Nisi Shawl one day.)
