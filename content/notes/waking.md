late morning (after a long restless<br> 
night) blurry eyes focus on the ceiling,<br>
sky in shadows, the clock projects<br> 
11:11 neon against the wall

an accusation somewhere vague<br>
in my brain, tainted modern<br>
criminal, off-balance, sleeping-in<br>
11:12 is the turn-key

out of bed into the cool room<br> 
exit the womb between<br> 
blanket and sheet, blasted<br> 
with air, light and dust<br> 
one must cross through<br> 
each day with an agenda<br> 
(formed, or not) this critical<br> 
movement, one world to the next

we traverse our time<br> 
fractured, come to terms<br> 
but the point is to awaken<br> 
alive, to drag our self from<br> 
the dead of sleep
