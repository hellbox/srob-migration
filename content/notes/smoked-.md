Record summer of fire<br>
close to your home &mdash;<br>
a trailer, parked at the confluence<br>
of the Columbia River overflowing<br>
with fish, and tinder dry<br>
Methow Valley. Gone. The water tower,<br>
school, and churches.<br>
Your tortilla comal and family<br>
pictures set in Michoacán, zircon<br>
tiara from a glowing quinceañera,<br>
torched. Smoked too, was your job<br>
tending hilly orchards where apples<br>
caramelized on the branch. Fire left you<br>
stranded like the bear cub<br>
whose mother couldn’t outrun<br>
the flames. Afterwards, no one ate <br>
the charred cows branded<br>
and fenced in pasture, who were bred<br>
not to flee, as you did, arriving<br>
years ago with a few pesos, holding<br>
tears on your tongue, and a blazing<br>
hope &mdash; you might have been<br>
the man standing, garden hose in hand,<br>
spraying down his roof, green lawn<br>
of dreams, untouched.
