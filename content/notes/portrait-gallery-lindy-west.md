For my thirtieth portrait for Portrait Gallery, I picked Seattle's own Lindy West. She has been everywhere lately: we [reviewed her book](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/go-west-young-woman/), and Paul did [this amazing interview with her](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/05/18/talking-with-lindy-west-about-fantasy-novels-deadlines-and-why-seattle-is-her-home/). She was at Town Hall last night, but if you missed it, you can still catch her tonight at [Third Place Books in Lake Forest Park](http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/lindy-west-shrill-notes-loud-woman) before she's off to events around the country and in the UK.
