* Tickets for the May 23rd Seattle appearance of *Arrested Development* and *Transparent* actor Jeffrey Tambor [went on sale yesterday](http://www.lectures.org/season/special_events.php?id=470). Seattle Arts and Lectures is bringing him to town to celebrate the publication of his memoir *Are You Somebody?*

* Cory Doctorow is [launching an online ebook retailer](http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/73044-london-book-fair-2017-cory-doctorow-unveils-his-latest-publishing-experiment-fair-trade-e-books.html) codenamed Shut Up and Take My Money, which he bills as the world's first "fair trade" online store.

<blockquote>As an author, being my own e-book retailer gets me a lot. It gets me money: once I take the normal 30 percent retail share off the top, and the customary 25 percent royalty from my publisher on the back-end, my royalty is effectively doubled. It gives me a simple, fair way to cut all the other parts of the value-chain in on my success: because this is a regular retail sale, my publishers get their regular share, likewise my agents. And, it gets me up-to-the-second data about who's buying my books and where.</blockquote>

* Amazon is not just threatening bookstores anymore. Turns out, [according to Naked Capitalism,](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/03/will-amazon-destroy-us-jobs-china.html) Amazon might be putting **12 million non-book retail jobs** at risk, too. Amazon's growth is increasing, mall retail stores are collapsing, and Amazon only needs half as many employees as brick-and-mortars.

* This tweet is making the rounds:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kafka&#39;s diaries show the real fun side of writing. <a href="https://t.co/h7UWC7UFVR">pic.twitter.com/h7UWC7UFVR</a></p>&mdash; Matt Haig (@matthaig1) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthaig1/status/843585485507383296">March 19, 2017</a></blockquote>

* Regarding that tweet, to aspiring writers: for God's sake, **don't suffer for your art**. Just write every day, no matter how difficult it may be. You will improve and it will get easier. Writing doesn't have to be a Kafkaesque experience.
