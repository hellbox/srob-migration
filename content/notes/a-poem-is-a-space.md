and an unspace<br>
It is all and half of all &mdash;<br>
a third of half<br>
and a tenth of that<br>
A poem floats &mdash; spaceless<br>
yet touches a finger,<br>
an eye, lips and a hand.<br>
A poemâ€™s content<br>
and form are sublime<br>
yet, narrow and broad<br>
A poem is speechless with sound<br>
Such is ambiguity &mdash; it lives in every act<br>
Therefore, the poem is an act &mdash; an event &mdash; <br>
An event is an act &mdash; is a poem<br>
&mdash; and more &mdash;
