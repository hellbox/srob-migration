The *Hollywood Reporter* [got the scoop](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hugh-jackman-fox-2000-team-ya-best-seller-absolutely-true-diary-a-part-time-indian-951763): Hugh Jackman and Fox 2000 are helping to bring Seattle author Sherman Alexie's popular YA novel *The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian* to a theater near you. Alexie, who has directed films in the past, will write the screenplay for the adaptation. Jackman will also play a supporting role in the film. This is a big damn deal for a book that has demonstrated remarkable longevity with young readers. Hopefully, with Alexie's involvement, Fox and Jackman will do the book justice.
