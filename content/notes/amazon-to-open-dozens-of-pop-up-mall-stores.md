<blockquote>Amazon is aggressively expanding its presence in the real-world retail market, with a plan to open dozens of new pop-up stores in US shopping malls over the next year, a source familiar with the matter told Business Insider.</blockquote>

These stores mostly seem to be device sales locations, not bookstores. Meanwhile, Barnes & Noble's founder and interim CEO calls the retail environment "[one of the worst I have ever experienced in the 50 years I have been in this industry](https://consumerist.com/2016/09/08/barnes-noble-founder-retail-climate-is-terrible-sales-will-keep-falling/)."
