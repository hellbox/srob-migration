The *Wall Street Journal*'s [Greg Bensinger quotes](http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-plans-hundreds-of-brick-and-mortar-bookstores-mall-ceo-says-1454449475) Sandeep Mathrani, a chief executive of a company that owns malls nationwide, as saying that Amazon could be opening as many as 400 brick-and-mortar stores in the US. It's just a rumor at this point, but it makes sense.

This, of course, is bad news for booksellers everywhere. University Book Store's manager [Pam Cady recently admitted](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/21/university-book-store-warns-of-sales-impact-from-amazon-books/) that the new Amazon Books in University Village has eaten into her store's profits, and other booksellers have expressed concern about Amazon Books opening near them. Independent booksellers and Barnes & Noble have peacefully coexisted for a decade now, but Amazon has [a proven strategy](http://www.businessinsider.com/sadistic-amazon-treated-book-sellers-the-way-a-cheetah-would-pursue-a-sickly-gazelle-2013-10) of picking off brick-and-mortar bookstores. They would absolutely target pre-existing bookstores with their new outlets.

<p class="footer">If you're coming to this story late, here's a little background: I wrote about [my experience with Amazon Books](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/09/the-algorithm-method/) shortly after it opened. Additionally, the *Seattle Review of Books* is proud to be the co-sponsor (along with Elliott Bay Book Company) of the [world's first reverse-showrooming of Amazon Books](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/06/independent-bookstore-fan-showrooms-amazon-books/).</p>
