Find out how your favorite literary publication did in the [first VIDA count of the Trump era](http://www.vidaweb.org/the-2016-vida-count/). (If you're unfamiliar with VIDA, it's an organization that counts the number of women — and now, nonbinary — authors in literary publications. One of our very first posts on the *Seattle Review of Books* was [an interview with author Nicola Griffith](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/07/27/talking-with-nicola-griffith-about-the-importance-of-counting-womens-stories/) about the importance of counting women in media.)

This year saw progress at a number of major literary magazines, including the *New Yorker* and *Tin House* and the *New York Times Book Review*. But other organizations like *The Nation* and *Harper's*, are actually on the decline. It seems significant, doesn't it, that bylines by women declined at stalwart liberal magazines during the same year in which Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton to win the presidency?
