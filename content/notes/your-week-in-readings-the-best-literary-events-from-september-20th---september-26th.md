<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday September 20th: *Season of Sacrifice* Reading **</h5></p> 
Seattle writer Bharti Kirchner has written a ton of great novels that you should check out. Tonight, though, she’s debuting something new: the first book in a mystery series starring a Seattle private investigator named Maya Mallick. In *Season of Sacrifice*, she investigates the self-immolation death of a prominent scientist.

This one is a little different: The Washington National Park’s Discovery Group hosts a booze dinner in which scientific experts discuss projects they’re running in Washington national parks. At the end of the night, one of the projects will be funded by pooling everyone’s admission fee in a kind of *American Idol* for science.

You might remember Nathan Englander’s debut collection of short fiction, *For the Relief of Unbearable Urges*, for its beautiful sweaty cover. His new novel looks at a controversial subject — the conflict between Palestine and Israel — through the experiences of a disparate group of people including a prisoner and a waitress.
