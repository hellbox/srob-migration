<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

**I love to read. I love to smoke pot. I can't smoke pot and read. I can get high and watch movies, but words on a page get all swimmy when I've had even just a single puff. But I have friends who love to smoke and read, and they make me so jealous when they talk about sitting down for a night with a book and a joint and reading two or three hundred pages at a go. Can I make my dream a reality, or is my own brain chemistry working against me?**

<p class="noindent">Dear Jean,</p>

I find your friends' claims of reading (let alone retaining) hundreds of pages of text while high incredibly suspect, perhaps because I have trouble with basic tasks while high, like peeling fruit, blinking, and telephones. What in the Oxford-loving fuck are your friends reading and how could it possibly be more fun than rubbing your belly and chanting the word "velocity" under your breath in a dark closet?

To your question: Instead of reading books, give graphic novels a try. Ignore what little text there is and focus on the beautiful illustrations. I'd start with [*Black Hole*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780375714726) and [*Bottomless Belly Button*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781560979159) – both of which, if memory serves, are pretty light on text. Another option is to pick up [*Weathercraft*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781606993408) or [*Congress of the Animals*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781606994375) by local genius Jim Woodring. Most of his books are wordless, beautiful and weird. 

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
