<p class="noindent">
Sponsor Seattle Arts & Lectures stopped by just a few weeks ago to promote their 2017/2018 season, a 30th anniversary celebration packed with speakers you'll want to see. Now they're back to highlight three deftly curated special series: Sherman Alexie Loves, Women You Need to Know, and SAL's Poetry Series, which is one of the best Seattle has to offer.</p>

We're excited to see such impressive lineups, and especially that SAL has brought so many voices into the selection process — the Poetry Series was chosen with advice from new Civic Poet Anastacia-Reneé, Billie Swift of Open Books, and Claudia Castro Luna, among others. Women You Need to Know continues to shine in its third year, with Janet Mock, Ijeoma Oluo, and Ariel Levy. And we couldn't be more thrilled to see Sherman Alexie back on stage. Check out the full lineup, get tickets while you can, and settle in for an amazing season.
