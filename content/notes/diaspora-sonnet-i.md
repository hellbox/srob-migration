I walk the narrow pedestrian passage<br>
illumined so its girdered ribs show<br>
like names on a ledger. Every step<br>
sudden and trochaic &mdash; the beginning<br>
of facts. Of being here.

I look up and see the moon<br>
is brandishing its ghosts. What is<br>
here and not here. What is<br>
a face in the sky. What breaks<br>
the shape of the known and obvious.

If I could say it, I would say<br>
"I was broken and I took him in."<br>
I would ask, "Do you trust me?"<br>
I would point to the landscape.
