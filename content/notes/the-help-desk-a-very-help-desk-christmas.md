<p class="intro">*Every Friday, Cienna Madrid offers solutions to life’s most vexing literary problems. Do you need a book recommendation to send your worst cousin on her birthday? Is it okay to read erotica on public transit? Cienna can help. Send your questions to* advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

**Do you have a favorite Christmas book?**

<p class="noindent">**Timothy, Licton Springs**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Timothy,</p>

Yes, I do: David Sedaris's *Holidays on Ice*. But if you haven't read it, don't bother – [listen to Sedaris read *Santaland Diaries* instead](https://www.npr.org/2016/12/23/506475364/a-holiday-tradition-david-sedaris-reads-santaland-diaries). Back before the internet consumed 90 percent of our collective attention, this was a highly anticipated Christmas tradition in my household. Sedaris is a powerful reader of his own work and my family had to tune in to NPR at just the right time to catch his dry retelling of what it's like to be a Macy's Christmas elf named Crumpet. His story will make you love elves, hate children and pity those who give birth to them.

<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

**With all the GoFundMes and the Giving Tuesdays, I don’t know what to do with my charitable giving anymore. Do you have any ideas for which literary nonprofits are especially worth my time?**

<p class="noindent">**Don, Roosevelt**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Don,</p>

I'm thinking of starting a nonprofit that would pay women to run around and give men titty twisters while screaming "REPARATIONS!" But until that gets off the ground, [Hugo House](https://hugohouse.org/support-hugo-house/) is one of my personal favorites; [The Greater Seattle Bureau of Fearless Ideas](http://fearlessideas.org/get_involved/donate/) (formerly 826Seattle) is fantastic; and [Seattle7Writers](https://co.clickandpledge.com/sp/d1/default.aspx?wid=47739) is stacked with great people doing great work.

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
