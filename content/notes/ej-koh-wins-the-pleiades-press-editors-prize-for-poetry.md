Seattle poet EJ Koh [announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thisisEJKoh/status/764137891341611009?lang=en) that her poetry collection *A Lesser Love* has won the 2016 [Pleiades Press](http://pleiadespress.org/about/) Editors Prize for Poetry. The book will be published next year. 

If you'd like to learn more about Koh, we published her wonderful poem ["Korean War"](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/06/korean-war/) last fall, and she will be a featured reader — along with poet Robert Lashley and Seattle author Sherman Alexie — at [the *Seattle Review of Books* reading at Bumbershoot](http://bumbershoot.com/lineup#!programmation=artist$seattle-review-of-books-featuring-sherman-alexie-robert-lashley-and-ej-koh/164) this year.
