<p class="intro">Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles good for slow consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-sunday-post/" title="Sunday Post archives">look through the archives.</a></p>

<h5><a href="http://www.gq.com/story/san-francisco-is-burning" title="San Francisco Is Burning - GQ">San Francisco Is Burning</a></h5>

<p>This one&#8217;s already causing <a href="https://twitter.com/jimray/status/878472279008567296">a little online consternation</a> (what doesn&#8217;t, these days?): Jon Ronson investigates whether a rash of fires in San Francisco&#8217;s Mission District could be arson, intended to drive out lower-income residents and make way for SF&#8217;s version of the epically sky-blocking tech towers that are springing up all over Seattle. Regardless of whether the fires are intentional or just ancient wiring and insulation, it&#8217;s a sign of the times that we&#8217;re ready to think this might be true. Average joe vs. rich developer is a longstanding David-and-Goliath trope — but has it ever been as widespread and divisive as it is right now?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For five days, Gideon was going to be an arsonist: “Five days between me meeting the guy and, bam, the cops knocking on my door.”</p>
<p>To his credit, The Mountain View was supposed to be empty on the day of the planned fire. His insurance company had been paying his tenants “to get the fuck out of the building.” And they were relocating. “They were taking off like roaches,” he says.</p>
<p>Half an hour ago, Gideon referred to his residents as pigeons. Now they’re roaches.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.raconteur.net/current-affairs/how-close-are-we-to-doomsday" title="How close are we to doomsday? - Raconteur">How close are we to doomsday?</a></h5>

<p>Periodically the <em>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</em> <a href="http://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clockwork8052">moves the hands of the Doomsday Clock</a>, reflecting a shift in world currents that brings us <a href="http://thebulletin.org/timeline">closer to (or farther from — wouldn&#8217;t that be nice?)</a> &#8220;destroying our world with dangerous technologies of our own making.&#8221; It&#8217;s a powerful visual metaphor to express that we&#8217;re nearer now to self-destruction than at almost any point in past 70 years. Oliver Pickup tracks the clock&#8217;s history and the reasons behind the recent 30-second jump toward midnight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this precise moment we are the closest to the apocalypse since the 1950s, a twitchy period when Cold War combatants, the United States of America and the Soviet Union, were doggedly pursuing the hydrogen bomb. At least that’s according to the *Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists*’ symbolic Doomsday Clock, which sparked global alarm when it ticked forward to two-and-a-half minutes to midnight in January.</p>

<p>More worrying still, the 2017 time setting was determined before North Korea’s recent spate of nuclear missile tests, and climate-change denier Donald Trump’s erratic presidency, which has re-chilled Russian-American relations, had begun in earnest.</p></blockquote>

<p>The original design of the clock, featured on the cover of the <em>Bulletin</em> in 1947, was revised a few years ago by Michael Beirut, who also <a href="http://designobserver.com/feature/im-with-her/39523">designed the iconic logo for Hillary Clinton&#8217;s 2016 presidential run</a>.

<h5><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-letterpress-printing-came-back-from-the-dead/" title="How letterpress printing came back from the dead - Backchannel">How letterpress printing came back from the dead</a></h5>

<p>It&#8217;s a little sad to see the renascence of letterpress printing credited to Martha Stewart — at least, for those who love not just the output, but the messy, painstaking process, the geekery of platen vs. cylinder, the mind-bending complexity of thinking about language through a mirror and in three dimensions. If you can forgive Glenn Fleishman the sin of attribution, here&#8217;s a good piece on Seattle&#8217;s still-growing letterpress scene and how digital technologies are changing the throwback industry.</p>

<blockquote>
Though letterpress might seem like yet another expression of a society hankering for artisanal, one-of-a-kind goods in an era of endless, identical reproduction, this return to the past is different. Beneath the old-timey patina of letterpress goods is a full-scale digital reinvention that drags Gutenberg’s great creation into the full embrace of modern technology.

<h5><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/on-the-lonely-midnight-trail-of-orkney-s-corncrakes" title="Night Life - Aeon">Night Life</a></h5>

<p>Doomsday, arson, gentrification, and the tech industry in everything &#8230; In case this week&#8217;s post is too much like your Twitter feed, here&#8217;s something thoughtful, solitary, and just a little bit quixotic: Amy Liptrot spent a summer on Orkney Island, trying to heal her life and counting a rare, endangered bird she never saw. After dark, the world transforms itself, and she has just the right voice to help us hear it.</p>

<blockquote>
I am the night listener. My woolly hat pushes my ears forward. I chew no gum, wear no rustling clothes. The work is repetitive — driving to the next stop, pulling in if possible, turning off the ignition, winding down the windows, consulting the map and noting down the grid reference. Then I wait for the noise of the car engine and my head to subside, and the sounds of the night to reveal themselves.

<p>Most of the writers interviewed for Danny Funt&#8217;s article on the necessity of
serious reading to good journalism have appeared in the Sunday Post at one point or another. The perfect mashup for <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> readers, as well as a strong argument in favor of reading as as a practical way to interact with the world. Probably not a discussion we need to keep having, but this is an interesting version of it.</p>

<blockquote>
I spoke with a dozen accomplished journalists of various specialties who manage to do their work while reading a phenomenal number of books, about and beyond their latest project. With journalists so fiercely resented after last year’s election for their perceived elitist detachment, it might seem like a bizarre response to double down on something as hermetic as reading — unless you see books as the only way to fully see the world.
