Ordinarily, I use this space to write about the comics that I've read over the past week. But this Saturday is Free Comic Book Day — that nationwide celebration of the belief that there's a comic out there for everyone — and so we're going to look forward for a change. If you've never participated before, you should know that it's pretty simple: walk into the store, get some comics for free. If you have questions, ask the staff. 

**Where should you go?** Well, [there's a map of all the participating shops here](http://www.freecomicbookday.com/). But a lot of local stores are throwing special events, too. A partial list:

* **Comics Dungeon in Wallingford** will be hosting local cartoonists all day. [I spoke with the Dungeon's owner Scott Tomlin about his plans](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/05/01/how-to-celebrate-free-comic-book-day-and-promote-literacy-at-the-same-time/) — and the exciting new literacy nonprofit behind his shop — [earlier this week](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/05/01/how-to-celebrate-free-comic-book-day-and-promote-literacy-at-the-same-time/).

* From 11 am to 3 pm, [**Phoenix Comics and Games** on Broadway](http://phoenixseattle.com/free-comic-book-day-2017/) will host Seattle comics writer G. Willow Wilson — who was recently [the subject of a terrific *New Yorker* profile](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/g-willow-wilsons-american-heroes) and the driving force behind [a very good conversation about faith on the *Ezra Klein Show*](http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/vox/the-ezra-klein-show/e/g-willow-wilson-on-religion-comics-and-modern-myths-49722931) —  along with cartoonist Kazu Kibuishi and author/translator Zack Davisson.

* Downtown's **Zanadu Comics** is [throwing a big sale](http://www.zanaducomics.com/free-comic-book-day/) and handing out special coupons all day long. If you regularly buy comics in Seattle, you should stop by Zanadu and buy a comic or two; the store has recently fallen on tough financial times and they've been [running a GoFundMe](http://www.zanaducomics.com/gofundme) to stay afloat. They've still got some of the best selection in town, and they could use a little love.

* **Arcane Comics**, which last year moved just across the Seattle border to Shoreline, is [hosting local cartoonists Jen Vaughn, Chris Sheridan, and Tatiana Gill](https://www.facebook.com/events/736226343217519/).

* There are plenty of other shops, too, including Fremont's [Outsider Comics & Geek Boutique](http://www.outsidercomics.com/), the [Fantagraphics Bookstore & Gallery](http://fantagraphics.com/flog/whats-store-comic-book-day/) in Georgetown, [Dreamstrands Comics & Collectibles](http://www.dreamstrands.com/freecomicday.html) in Greenwood, [Golden Age Collectibles](http://www.goldenagecollectables.com/) in the Pike Place Market (which I just now learned from their website claims to be America's oldest comics shop,) and [The Dreaming Comics & Games](http://www.dreamingcomics.com/) in the U District.

And **what should you pick up?** Well, you can [find a full list of the Free Comic Book Day books here](http://www.freecomicbookday.com/catalog), and there's something for most everyone's taste. But here are a couple to look out for:

* Obviously, you should read the Fantagraphics collection [*World's Greatest Cartoonists*](http://www.freecomicbookday.com/Catalog/JAN170028), which features a bunch of artists from the Fantagraphics stable including Emil Ferris, Noah Van Sciver, and Simon Hanselmann.

* If you're unfamiliar with the weird and wonderful collaborations between French cartoonist Moebius and the great director Alejandro Jodorowsky, [this sampler of their comic *The Incal*](http://www.freecomicbookday.com/Catalog/JAN170031) should definitely be on your list.

* The [*Colorful Monsters* collection](http://www.freecomicbookday.com/Catalog/JAN170024) has just about everything a kid could want, including some Moomin comics, monsters, and hot air balloons.

* Cartoonist Kate Beaton loves the all-ages comic *Bad Machinery*, and [this sampler](http://www.freecomicbookday.com/Catalog/JAN170039) is a good introduction to the series, about some young crime-solvers. In this caper, they encounter Communists and a very anachronistic person.

Have fun out there! Stay hydrated, get some free comics, maybe buy a comic or two, and [follow along with us on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/seattlereviewof/) as we travel around to some of our favorite shops.
