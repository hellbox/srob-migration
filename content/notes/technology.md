All the cell phone towers are pagodas<br>
from the top floor through my near-sighted eyes—<br>
blue, white, red shimmering houses<br>
for ancient gods among the fir trees and dogwood.<br>
They climb the hills to the cemetery, carrying<br>
the voices of the living far above the lost<br>
chatter of those already gone before us.

The words are like raindrops in a summer storm<br>
here then gone, sadness borne away<br>
over the continents. And love<br>
or the failure of love, wounds and caresses.<br>
The seas wander underneath.<br>
Somewhere in this forest of voices<br>
a pen is writing in blue ink.
