* Samantha Pak at the Seattle Globalist has written [a great report on diversity in Seattle's bookstore scene](http://www.seattleglobalist.com/2016/06/27/seattle-bookstores-tackle-literatures-lack-of-diversity/52964). It's a must-read.

* Seattle cartoonist Seth Goodkind discovered that someone plagiarized his artwork in order to win a contest put on by a music festival. When confronted, the artist apologized, but Goodkind wrote a wonderful letter explaining why plagiarism and contests for "exposure" harm artists. It's [publicly posted on his Facebook wall](https://www.facebook.com/sethbeastmeat/posts/696452340495554) and it's worth your time to read the whole thing. A taste:

<blockquote>Try asking several car dealerships if they will let you drive their vehicles around for a couple of weeks, and, if you like one, you might pay them for the mileage, and in the meantime, it’ll be “great exposure.” Considered this way, spec-work is simply a way of taking an artists work for little or nothing. In essence, theft.</blockquote>

* I recently interviewed the author Mary Roach about [her wonderful book *Grunt*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/rational-exuberance/) at Town Hall Seattle. If you couldn't attend, the audio of that interview is now [available over at KUOW](http://kuow.org/post/mary-roach-curious-tales-extraordinary-science-war).

* "It is nearly impossible to be a writer and not be complicit in white supremacy," writes Zinzi Clemmons in an essay titled "[What It Means to Be an Inclusive Literary Journal](http://lithub.com/what-it-means-to-be-an-inclusive-literary-journal/)" published at Literary Hub.

* [Don't listen to *USA Today*](http://gawker.com/cormac-mccarthy-isnt-dead-but-an-old-prankster-tricked-1782747839): Cormac McCarthy is still alive.
