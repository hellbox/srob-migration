<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday May 24th: Displaced: Refugee Voices in Conversation**</h5></p> 
The Northwest Immigrant and Refugee Health Coalition is assembling a panel of refugees to discuss what it’s like to become a refugee in this country, and what life in America for refugees is like right now. These are conversations that everyone should hear — a reminder that Trump’s policies have real repercussions for real people. 
*Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m. *

 <p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday May 25th: *Broken River* Reading**</h5></p>
 J. Robert Lennon’s newest novel, *Broken River*, is about a husband and wife who try to find a new start in a house with a history of violence. Lennon is sharing the stage with Seattle author Elissa Washuta in her last local appearance before she takes a position at Ohio State University.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday May 26th: Lashley/Lilley**</h5></p> 
You already know that Robert Lashley is a force of nature. He’s one of the most vibrant readers to come out of the Pacific Northwest. You might not know poet Gary Copeland Lilley, a Cave Canem fellow whose latest book is *The Bushman’s Medicine Show*. Together, the two of them are a bicoastal poetry assassin squad.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday May 27th: *Ghosts of Seattle Past* at Folklife**</h5></p> 
Hard to believe that Folklife is happening already — possibly because it’s been a rainy dismal hellscape for the last six months. But we finally made it! And why not celebrate the death of dismal winter with a special group reading by contributors to *Ghosts of Seattle Past*, the book which celebrates lost local landmarks?
*Seattle Center, http://www.nwfolklife.org/festival-schedule/. Free. All ages. 1:15 p.m*


<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday May 28th: *Girl on the Road* Reading**</h5></p> 
Seattle’s Office of Arts & Culture gives out grants to artists of all kinds. One of those grants went to local cartoonist Noel Franklin, for the completion of her memoir, *Girl on the Road*. This afternoon, Franklin presents a reading from the book, which is about friendship and loss and grief. She’ll also have printed samples of the book available for the audience. 
*Vermillion Art Gallery and Bar, 1508 11th Ave., 709-9797, http://vermillionseattle.com. Free. All ages. 5 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday May 29th: Lost in Translation**</h5></p> 
Look, you’ve always wanted to read onstage, but maybe you’ve been afraid of embarrassing yourself at your favorite reading? This is your chance to participate in a once-yearly reading. Sign up 30 minutes before the reading, and participants will be selected at random. If selected, you’ll have five minutes onstage, and if you screw — you won’t — you’ll never see these people again. Go live your dream.
