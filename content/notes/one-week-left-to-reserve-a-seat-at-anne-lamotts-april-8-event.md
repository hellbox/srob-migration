Sponsor Northwest Associated Arts returns to remind us that **Anne Lamott will be at Benaroya Hall** next week. Don't miss this event; Lamott is beloved by readers and writers, and this city is packed with both — the room will be full of energy, from the stage *and* from the seats.

Whether you're a follower of Lamott's *Bird by Bird* writing guide or a fan of her thoughtful, direct, and funny novels and essays, you should take the chance to see her in person. She's a sharp, warm, and witty speaker and an iconic presence. Get more information [on our sponsor’s page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/), or buy tickets [here](https://www.seattlesymphony.org/concerttickets/calendar/2017-2018/benaroyahall/anne-lamott).
