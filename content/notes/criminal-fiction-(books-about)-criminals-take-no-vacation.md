<h5>Reading around: new titles on the crime fiction scene</h5>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1503460322075/The%20Dark%20Net.Percy.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">
The zippy read that is _The Dark Net_ by Benjamin Percy (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt), is not for the faint-of-heart. Hard-bitten Portland journalist &mdash; and Luddite, a personality quirk that comes in mighty handy in this particular context &mdash; Lela stumbles on the story of her life &mdash; so far &mdash; when she trips over an odd-looking skull in a construction site smack dab in the middle of the trendy Pearl District. And things go literally haywire from there. A rich mash-up of suspense, techno-thriller, horror, and the supernatural, Percy pulls it all together with a terrific cast of characters, finely-tuned plot twists and killer prose, sprinkled generously with spot-on snark and fun puns, as well as lovely turns of phrase: “&hellip;she hears the call to prayer as it purls and echoes through the city.”

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1503460339223/Glass%20Houses.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">
Louise Penny’s detective Armand Gamache of the deceptively cozy and quiet Three Pines Quebecois village, has been a steadfast presence on the mystery scene for more than a decade. Now that he’s tackled and rousted out corruption at the highest levels of the Sûréte du Quebec, what’s left for a Chief Superintendent to do? Plenty, as it turns out. Penny’s _Glass Houses_ (Minotaur), a perfectly-structured novel, opens in a tension-filled Montreal courtroom. Then, the narrative shifts between Montreal and a chilly few days months earlier in Three Pines, when a mysterious figure stood on the village common and freaked everyone out. Penny’s produced a beautifully wrought and pleasurably clever novel about conscience, revenge, and one of the most potent criminal challenges of our time.

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1503460353729/Death%20by%20His%20Grace%20COV.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">
Murder hits uncomfortably close to home in Kwei Quartey’s _Death by His Grace_ (Soho), when Chief Inspector Darko Dawson’s wife’s cousin is killed. The detective deals with heightened familial tensions &mdash; not to mention the deterioration of his aging father, the wayward ways of his adopted son, and a bout of malaria &mdash; all while working to ferret out a dangerous killer. There’s plenty of delicious Ghanaian food mentions to salivate over and a friendly overview of Accra’s plentiful neighborhoods, but Quartey covers the bad as well as the good: an inherent part of the plot here includes the workings &mdash; and cons &mdash; of a charismatic church and its self-enriching leader.

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1503460373180/Yap_YESTERDAY.JPG)</p>

<p class="noindent">
In _Yesterday_ (Mulholland), Felicia Yap’s intricate and mind-bending debut, there’s murder with malice aforethought afoot and an ambitious, chess-obsessed detective on the case. But in Yap’s imagined world, unusual challenges abound: human memory is severely curtailed by either one or two days _tops_, and everyone tries to keep track of changes around them by updating (read: and possibly manipulating) their iDairy entries as best they can. A writer-turned-hopeful-politician and his long-suffering wife appear to be at the heart of the investigation; a vengeful woman appears to hold all the cards. In a novel with not one but four unreliable narrators at its core, you pretty much just have to strap in and go along for the bumplicious ride.

<h5>The Quintessential Interview: Ruth Ware</h5>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1503460386174/ruth-ware-small.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">
Ruth Ware’s third psychological thriller &mdash; and make no mistake, each of her novels melds psychological suspense with proper, page-turning thrills pretty damn flawlessly &mdash; is one of those books that breathes vibrant life into the term “atmospheric.” _The Lying Game_ (Scout Press), features a remote and boggy estuary, a decrepit old mill-house, and a local village for local people: this is the setting for the reunion of four grown-up friends who, as girls, teased the people around them with often funny and sometimes cruel mind-games, and who may be about to get their comeuppance.

<p class="noindent">**What or who are your top five writing inspirations?**</p>

<p class="noindent">
    I never know where inspiration will come from - for _In a Dark, Dark Wood_ it was a chance conversation with a friend about hen nights. _The Woman in Cabin 10_ was me reading too many Agatha Christie novels, combined with some seriously scary news stories about deaths at sea (Is it me, or has there been a spate of them recently? Maybe it's a case of noticing what you're attuned to). _The Lying Game_ was inspired by a place I visited in northern France (although being a writer, I swiftly snipped it out of its real-life setting and transposed it to the south of England). Online adverts. Books I've read. People I've met. Oh dear, this is more than five, isn't it?
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Top five places to write?**</p>

<p class="noindent">
    I'm having the opposite problem here: I only write at my desk due to having screwed up my back by writing in bed and on the sofa. Bed is probably my very favorite place to write, but I can't really get away with it any more, even with the most artfully arranged pillows. If I can count plotting, then I love thinking while I'm driving or doing mindless, familiar walks &mdash; the sort you do every day and could complete almost with your eyes closed. When I lived in London, I did my best plotting on the Tube. I think the key is going into a sort of stasis trance &mdash; putting your brain on standby, almost.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Top five favorite authors?**</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Only five!! This is so hard. Um&hellip; Agatha Christie &mdash; for a masterclass in plot. Daphne du Maurier for that effortless combination of mystery and emotion. Donna Tartt for creating huge expansive worlds that I love to live in. Shirley Jackson for being simply creeptastic. Patricia Highsmith for creating fully three-dimensional characters who leap off the page and into your head. Wow, that was hard. It's also not complete. There are a whole load of writers I love just as much.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Top five tunes to write to?**</p>

<p class="noindent"></p>

<p class="noindent">
    Ok, I'm back to having too few answers for this one. I can't write to music; in fact, I really prefer complete silence.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Top five hometown spots?**</p>

<p class="noindent">
    I'm spending a lot of time on Brighton's Palace Pier, partly because it's a beautiful, crazy throwback to Victorian seaside life, partly as tangential research for my new book. My perfect Brighton day might involve a walk on the pier, throwing some stones into the sea, lunch at La Choza, a truly delicious Mexican restaurant in Brighton's North Lanes, then a drive out into the beautiful Sussex Downs for a drink in one of the country pubs. I love a pub with a proper beer garden – soft green grass underfoot and a wasp trapped under an up-turned beer glass. The Cricketers Arms in Berwick or the Ram Inn at Firle are both excellent. While I am out that way, I might drop into Charleston Farmhouse, once the Sussex refuge of the Bloomsbury circle and now a fascinating period piece, frozen in amber as tribute to them. If I had the energy, I'd finish up by climbing Firle Beacon, but more likely I'd just stretch out in the sunshine, watch the lengthening shadows, and order another glass of wine.
