<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday March 24th: *The Idiot* Reading**</h5></p> 
*New Yorker* writer Elif Batuman has only one other book to her name: a non-fiction account of people who are obsessed with Russian novelists. But her debut novel, The Idiot—about a Harvard freshman in the mid-1990s who falls in with some questionable Eastern European types—is earning praise from all quarters.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday March 25th: *Growing Up in Public* Reading**</h5></p> 
Georgetown’s Fantagraphics Bookstore and Gallery continues its recent trend of bringing international comics greats to Seattle with a rare appearance from Argentinian cartoonist Ezequiel Garcia. Garcia’s memoir, *Growing Up in Public*, is about life as a cartoonist in a society that continually devalues the importance of the arts. (Take notes, American cartoonists.)

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday March 28th: *Who Built Seattle?* Reading**</h5></p>

Ortblad will discuss the decisions we didn’t make as a city and the repercussions of the choices we did make.
*Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m*
