Shelf Awareness [published](http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2581#m29620) an account of two Washington state booksellers who recently had to close due to rampant wildfires. One of the bookstores, Winthrop's delightful [Trail's End](http://www.trailsendbookstore.com/), is open again and "plans to donate proceeds from coffee sales at its espresso bar to vetted fire relief funds." If you're ever in the Methow Valley, you should go out of your way to visit Trail's End; it's a delightful and well-stocked little shop. We're glad to hear they're all okay and back to serving the community.
