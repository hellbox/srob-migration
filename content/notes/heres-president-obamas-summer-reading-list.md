David Nakamura at the [*Washington Post*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/13/here-are-the-6-books-on-president-obamas-summer-reading-list/) reports the six books President Obama is taking on his 16-day summer vacation:

* *Washington: A Life* by Ron Chernow

* *Between the World and Me* by Ta-Nehisi Coates

* *All The Light We Cannot See* by Anthony Doerr

* *The Sixth Extinction* by Elizabeth Kolbert

* *The Lowland* by Jhumpa Lahiri

* *All That Is* by James Salter

That's a pretty impressive summer reading list. The Lahiri novel is an underrated work, the Doerr is unanimously beloved, and the Coates is beautiful and challenging and heartbreaking.
