<h5>[Dictionary Stories](http://www.dictionarystories.com)</h5>

A neat project from [Jez Burrows](https://twitter.com/jezburrows), one of the few designers at Facebook who actually work with [analog materials](https://www.facebook.com/analoglab), and the [publisher and designer of a fantastic short story collection](http://www.singstatistics.co.uk). He's writing short stories "composed entirely of example sentences from the New Oxford American Dictionary."

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">**Hunter**</p>

<p class="noindent">He perched on the edge of the bed, a <span class="highlight">study</span> in confusion and misery, a <span class="highlight">study</span> of a man devoured by awareness of his own mediocrity. The place was dreadfully <span class="highlight">untidy</span>. Tattered notebooks filled with illegible <span class="highlight">hieroglyphics</span>, the evolution of <span class="highlight">animal</span> life, the <span class="highlight">mysteries</span> of analytical psychology, victorian <span class="highlight">architecture</span>… The street lamps shed a faint <span class="highlight">light</span> into the room. It was beginning to <span class="highlight">rain</span>.<br>	Ruth listened to the <span class="highlight">rhythm</span> of his breathing. She sat very <span class="highlight">still</span>, her eyes closed. She heard the <span class="highlight">click</span> of the door. He was thrown backward by the <span class="highlight">force</span> of the explosion.<br>	Her hunting days were <span class="highlight">done</span>.

<h5>[“Don't mention the war." - Some Thoughts on H.P. Lovecraft and Race](http://davidnickle.blogspot.ca/2014/08/dont-mention-war-some-thoughts-on-hp.html)</h5>

A piece from [David Nickle](https://twitter.com/bydavidnickle), published last year, that explores his trouble in getting people to talk about Lovecraft's race problems. 

<blockquote>
I'd make the case that Lovecraft's fiction—and Lovecraftian horror—depends on the xenophobia that was endemic to Lovecraft's work to the point that without it, many of his stories lose their unique and uniquely profound effect.  "The Horror in Red Hook" is a direct channelling of Lovecraft's loathing of newcomers to New York City; the real horror of "The Call of Cthulhu" is not the octopus-headed demigod that emerges out of his underwater city to kill all the people, but the people themselves—all either eugenically unfit denizens of the bayou or "primitive" island cultures whose religious practises amount to a kind of proactive nihilism.  The manifestation of Nyarlathotep in the eponymous story is that of a black man bearing trinkets, who seduces the good white folk of America into authoring their own demise.

<h5>[Orwell's review of Mein Kampf](http://boingboing.net/2014/08/17/orwells-review-of-mein-kampf.html)</h5>

Did you know Orwell wrote a review of _Mein Kampf_ in 1940? 

<blockquote>
<p>Suppose that Hitler's programme could be put into effect. What he envisages, a hundred years hence, is a continuous state of 250 million Germans with plenty of "living room" (i.e., stretching to Afghanistan or thereabouts), a horrible brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens except the training of young men for war and the endless breeding of fresh cannon-fodder. How was it that he was able to put this monstrous vision across? it is easy to say at once stage of his career he was financed by the heavy industrialists, who saw in him the man who would smash the Socialists and Communists. They would not have backed him, however, if he had not talked a great movement into existence already. Again, the situation in Germany, with its seven million unemployed, was obviously favourable for demagogues. But Hitler could not have succeeded against his many rivals if it had not been for the attraction of his own personality, which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of _Mein Kampf_, and which is no doubt overwhemling when one hears his speeches&hellip;. The fact is that there is something deeply appealing about him. Once feels it again when one sees his photographs—and I recommend especially the photograph at the beginning of Hurst and Blackett's edition, which shows Hitler in his early Brownshirt days. It is a pathetic, dog-like face, the face of a man suffering under intolerable wrongs. In a rather more manly way it reproduces the expression of innumerable pictures of Christ crucified, and there is little doubt that this is how Hitler sees himself. The initial, personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only be guessed at; but at any rate, the grievance is here. He is the martyr, the victim, Prometheus chained to the rock, the self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how to make it seem like a dragon. One feels, as with Napoleon, that he is fighting against destiny, that he _can't_ win, and yet that he somehow deserves to. The attraction of such a pose is of course enormous; half the films that one sees turn upon such themes.</p>

<h5>[Resources: digital First Folios](http://sarahwerner.net/blog/2015/08/resources-digital-first-folios/)</h5>

Scholar and historian [Sarah Werner](https://twitter.com/wynkenhimself) posted a list all the digitized Shakespeare First Folios available online. 

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve written about <a href="http://sarahwerner.net/blog/2013/05/what-do-we-want-from-online-facsimiles-of-shakespeare/">digitizing Shakespeare’s First Folio</a> before, looking at the interfaces of the many different copies out there. But I’m turning my attention to this again for my contribution on the subject for the in-progress&nbsp;<em>Cambridge Companion to the First Folio</em>, edited by Emma Smith. In my article, I’ll be thinking about why there are so many libraries digitizing this same book over and over again and what these many projects can teach us about what we look for from the First Folio and from digital tools.</p>
