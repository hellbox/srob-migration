If you're a mystery fan, you're likely still stinging from the loss of Pioneer Square's Seattle Mystery Bookshop. But you should know that this Saturday you'll have an opportunity to find some great deals on mystery novels while also supporting the Friends of the Seattle Public Library.

From [9 am to 5 pm at the North Seattle College, the Friends of the Library will host their holiday "better" book sale](http://www.friendsofspl.org/book-sales/), which features "like-new" books that make for great gift opportunities. The thing that makes this sale extra-special is that before they closed, Seattle Mystery Bookshop donated a significant part of their collection to the Friends. You'll find a lot of that collection at this sale.

If you're feeling selfish and want to keep the books for yourself, that's okay, too. Books start at $3 a pop, and it benefits a great cause.
