It was hours and then the end is almost over.<br>
Velvet curtains all in rustle at the borders<br>
of the stage. Our eyes are dry, our knees numb,

our temples dull. Nothing is left to be begun:<br>
No tearing at the breasts of hairdoed birds,<br>
no smooth unscrolling of the Italian words

for _love_ and _loss_. No garden froth, no castle wall<br>
to knock the sword against, no impossible<br>
extension of the slenderest ankle in its arc.

The lights on stage will dim and so we feel the dark, <br>
feel how the real &mdash; real sex, real pain, real meat &mdash;<br>
awaits us in the car. We feel the purses at our feet.

Onstage the voices call but we are half-<br>
way back to home by now, numbering the claps,<br>
saying the bravos that we hope are minimum.

We are adding up the babysitter's sum.<br>
We are watching for the last breath of the lover.<br>
We forget to be the ones who don't recover.
