<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday August 2nd: Reading Through It: *Evicted* **</h5></p> 
Join the *Seattle Review of Books* and the *Seattle Weekly* in the latest of our monthly book discussion series.  This month’s book, the Pulitzer Prizewinning *Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City*, is the first selection that could possibly evoke absolutely no discussion of President Trump. Come talk about why the rent is so damn high with us!
*Third Place Books Seward Park, 5041 Wilson Ave S, 474-2200, http://thirdplacebooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m * 
 
 <p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday August 3rd: X Y Z Gallery Opening**</h5></p>

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday August 4th: Science Fiction Songwriting for Teens**</h5></p> 
This is exactly why we have a public library system: real recording artists will work with Seattle-area teens (that’s age 13 and up) to write and record songs about the sci-fi story of their choice. If you record a sea shanty about *Battlefield Earth*, please email it to me, okay? 
*Seattle Public Library, Southwest Branch, 9010 35th Ave SW, http://spl.org. Free, registration required. All ages. 2:30 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday, August 5th: Noir at the Bar: Los Angeles vs. Seattle**</h5></p> 
The mystery-themed reading series at Seattle’s swankiest bar continues with a very special episode. Los Angeles writers including Sarah M. Chen, Ashley Erwin, Danny Gardner, and more will do literary battle with Seattle mystery writers including Kat Richardson, Tracy Weber, and Nick Feldman. The home team had better win this one.
*Sorrento Hotel, 900 Madison St., 622-6400, http://hotelsorrento.com. Free. 21 and over. 7:30 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday August 6th: Comics Dungeon Sale**</h5></p> 
Wallingford’s Comics Dungeon recently founded a nonprofit named Comics for Community, Compassion, and Culture, which teaches literacy through comics to kids. That means that if you visit Comics Dungeons’ anniversary sale and buy some $1 comics or discounted trade paperbacks, you won’t just be participating in crass commercialism — you’ll also be helping to teach local kids to read.
*Comics Dungeon, 319 NE 45th St., 545-8373. http://comicsdungeon.com. Free. All ages. 11 a.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday August 7th:  Seattle Mystery Authors Tell All**</h5></p> 
Join local mystery authors Glen Erik Hamilton, Robert Dugoni, Tracy Weber, and Jim Ziskin as they get together to discuss the pleasures and perils of being a mystery author. This evening is scheduled as a group discussion which will then segue into a conversation with the audience — perfect for aspiring authors to get some candid tips.
*University Book Store,  4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. * 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday August 8th: Three Poets Reading**</h5></p> 
Melissa Dickey writes weird and wonderful poems about miniature children and accidents. Andy Stallings wrote an amazing poem about the curvature of the Earth titled “Geometry.” Jay Thompson has written poems about *Dungeons & Dragons*. Together, the three will either read poems or combine their bodies to form a larger Voltron-type figure, or both.
*Open Books, 2414 N. 45th St., 633-0811, http://openpoetrybooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *
