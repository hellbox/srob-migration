<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday January 25th: *You’re the Most Beautiful Thing That Happened* Reading**</h5></p> 

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1484930488779/9780988735576_p0_v2_s192x300.jpg)</p>

Arisa White’s latest book “takes its titles from words used internationally as hate speech against gays and lesbians.” She’s the visiting author who highlights a night of poetry written and read by powerful women of color — White is joined by Seattle authors Natasha Marin and Naa Akua.  *Fred Wildlife Refuge, 128 Belmont Ave. E., 322-7030. http://www.hugohouse.org. $10. 21+. 7 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday January 26th: In the Cold**</h5></p> 

As Seattle prepares for the annual homeless survey — at the beginning of a year that will be dominated with discussion for how to deal with Seattle’s booming homeless population — our Civic Poet, Claudia Castro Luna hosts a reading and screening of a film to remind us of the human side behind the numbers. *City Hall Plaza, 600 4th Ave. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. * 
 
<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday January 27th: *The Undoing Project* Reading**</h5></p> 

Ever since *The Big Short* and *Moneyball* became runaway sensations, every new Michael Lewis book has become an event. His newest book documents the unconventional team of two Nobel Prize-winning Israeli psychologists. Lewis appears in conversation with Steve Scher to discuss how our understanding of decision-making was changed forever in their work. *University Temple United Methodist Church, 1415 NE 43rd Ave. http://ubookstore.com. $32.78. 7 p.m.* 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday January 28th: The Poet Is In**</h5></p> 

After speaking out for homeless Seattleites on Thursday, Civic Poet Claudia Castro Luna makes herself available to Seattleites who’d like to make “poetic explorations” into their city.  Castro Luna has been a ferocious advocate for poetry in Seattle; if you have any embarrassing questions that you’d like answered in a nonjudgmental fashion, this is your big chance. *Seattle Public Library, 1000 4th Ave., 386-4636, spl.org. Free. All ages. 2 p.m.* 

<h5>**Sunday January 29th: Residencies Revealed**</h5></p> 

Residencies are one of the best parts of being a writer: you get a roof over your head and time (and permission) to do nothing but sit there and write. Today, representatives from Northwest residencies and local writers will talk about what they’re like, how to get them, and which residencies are right for you. *Seattle Public Library, 1000 4th Ave., 386-4636, spl.org. Free. All ages. 2 p.m.* 

<h5>**Monday January 30th: *Freebird* Reading**</h5></p> 

See our Literary Event of the Week Column for more details. *University Book Store,  4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. PAUL CONSTANT*

<h5>**Tuesday January 31st: Loud Mouth Lit**</h5></p> 

Playwright and memoirist Paul Mullin has been thinking a lot about what makes readings special. His brand-new reading series looks to combine the smarts of a literary reading with the energy of a theatrical production. Tonight’s debut Loud Mouth Lit features Mullin alongside Scot Augustson, who’ll tell a story about time travel and corpses. *St. Andrews Bar & Grill, 7406 Aurora Ave N, 523-1193, https://www.facebook.com/LoudMouthLit/. Free. 21+. 8 p.m. *
