<p class="intro">_Somewhere the sky<br>
touches the earth &mdash; and<br>
the name of that place is<br>
the end &mdash; in between<br>
is the journey._<br>
&mdash; African Saying</p>

<h5>History Lesson: Diaspora</h5>

<p class="intro">_They love Africans in museum cases,<br>
so they left African cultures intact._<br>
&mdash; Ezekiel Mphahlele<br>
"Remarks on Negritude"</p>

First they stacked us<br>
in the holds of their dark ships

Then they feasted on our mothers<br>
our names&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our blood&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our shadows

They routed and captured our masks<br>
our thrones&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our bronze carved doors

Now in museums we discover our masks<br>
their ancient eyes track us

We shiver

Discrete signs announce our origins<br>
other signs caution us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not touch

Do not touch&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alarms will sound

Something shakes our memory<br>
we encounter our shadows

Something crosses and recrosses<br>
the danger water

We recall Praise Songs<br>
Our ancestors touch us

Our names come home

<h5>Horn Men</h5>

hey<br>
you ever wonder<br>
how they survive<br>
these quote unquote black<br>
men jazz jiving they tenor<br>
saxes<br>
in the up-to-date badlands<br>
of South Africa<br>
Johannesburg to be<br>
precise

some<br>
say they be bad<br>
they be up from the bush<br>
long time out of the<br>
bush these brothers be<br>
watch they<br>
pull music from spots<br>
of leopards<br>
from deep river beds<br>
some say they music be<br>
ancestor masks carved<br>
from water trees

these bad brothers<br>
what they know<br>
be awesome<br>
our essence<br>
uh huh

what they make<br>
be true as rain<br>
see how they sweeten<br>
this parched earth<br>
welcome these brothers<br>
hear them<br>
move us into freedom

and beyond

<h5>Song</h5>

<strong>1.</strong><br>
fresh off the<br>
boat<br>
they break you<br>
in barbados

they split for you<br>
you tounge<br>
they slice for you<br>
you ear

they dig for you<br>
a hole of dirt<br>
for you big child <br>
belly

they whip you<br>
make you belly<br>
lie down

they put on you<br>
you neck<br>
the ring of<br>
iron

they say no<br>
to no eat the<br>
sugar cane
					
they put on you<br>
you mouth<br>
the mask of<br>
tin

they tie you<br>
man to<br>
four green tree<br>	

they make you<br>
man fly to<br>
all four wind

they say you<br>
you sing<br>

<strong>2.</strong><br>
sing calypso sky<br>
sing soka wind<br>
they ship you<br>
to they home

all ways<br>
they break you<br>
in barbados

<strong>3.</strong><br>
salt<br>
all ways<br>
salt

<strong>4.</strong><br>
our bones be<br>
ocean floors

our bones be<br>
masts of ships

our bones be<br>
coral reefs

our bones sing<br>
of salt

<h5>Alien Dance Hall</h5>

Here a glittered stocking shimmers<br>
here a severed pair of eyes<br>
jams the blues

Everywhere<br>
desire flaps its tentlike arms

Legs slow drag in the pockmarked dust<br>
embrace suns blackened by ancient storms<br>
clawed birds scream<br>
perform a rag&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a cakewalk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a stomp<br>
a tango

Observe<br>
this needle wind delivers<br>
imported fragrances of old blood<br>
and fetal bones

Stay here if you wish<br>
Settle here if you wish

Remember while you can<br>
somebody called<br>
my ancestors cannibals

Dance with me<br>
Dance with me
