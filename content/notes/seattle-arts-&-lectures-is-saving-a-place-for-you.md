<p class="noindent">Seattle is alive with great readings and lectures, and this week's sponsor is a standout. Each year Seattle Arts & Lectures presents one of the most carefully curated programs in the city, bringing in big-name speakers and showcasing up-and-comers across a wide range of genres and themes. It's the kind of mix only a long-running series with a loyal audience can pull off.</p>

<p>SAL is celebrating three decades — no small achievement for an arts organization, even in a city like this one — and their 2017&#8211;2018 season lineup reflects that spirit of celebration. Single-event tickets go on sale on July 24; grab a subscription this week or be first in line on Monday, before headliners like Colson Whitehead and Viet Thanh Nguyen sell out.</p>

<p>Sponsors like Seattle Arts &amp; Lectures make the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> possible. Did you know you could sponsor us, as well?
