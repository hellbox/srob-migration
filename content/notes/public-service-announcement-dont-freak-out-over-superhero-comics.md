Right now, the internet is exploding with spoilers from [Marvel](http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/25/11769542/captain-america-marvel-comics-hydra-supervillain) and [DC Comics](http://io9.gizmodo.com/every-major-revelation-in-dc-comics-rebirth-special-1778505653). Which is weird. People seem to be getting genuinely upset over some of these plot twists, and they don't seem to understand that this kind of media feeding frenzy has been going on since at least the late 90s, when Superman died for the first time. Look, it's great to see people get excited about comics — I [write a column about comics every week](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/thursday-comics-hangover/) — but we don't need to [harangue creators](https://twitter.com/nickspencer/status/735466503303233536) or write very long thinkpieces in response to what is obviously a plot twist in an ongoing story. Corporate superhero comics are all about the illusion of change. Everything will be okay, I promise.
