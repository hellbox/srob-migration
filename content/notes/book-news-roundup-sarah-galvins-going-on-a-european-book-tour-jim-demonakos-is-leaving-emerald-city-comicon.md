* You can add poet Sarah Galvin to the short list of Seattle authors who have gone on a European tour. Starting on Sunday, Galvin will be traveling to bookstores in Amsterdam, Krakow, Paris, Berlin, and Reykjavik in support of her terrific new collection out from Gramma Press, *Ugly Time*. If you know anyone in or near those cities, let them know by [sending them a link to the tour page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1284894781580376/).

* Heidi MacDonald at the Beat [broke some pretty big news this morning](http://www.comicsbeat.com/jim-demonakos-to-leave-reedpop/): Jim Demonakos, the Seattle-area comics retailer who started Emerald City Comicon, has left the organization. Two years ago, [Demonakos sold ECCC to ReedPop](http://comicsalliance.com/emerald-city-comicon-reedpop-acquisitn-interview-demonakos-fensterman/), an international producer of comic book conventions. "I’m not leaving for another job, I don’t have an immediate new project," Demonakos wrote in a Facebook post announcing the change. This means that next year's ECCC will be the first time the show is not produced by its founder. It'll be interesting to see if the convention can maintain its essential Seattle-ness without Demonakos at the lead. 

* At [Strong Towns, Kea Wilson wrote a piece](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/4/20/why-urbanists-need-to-talk-about-amazon) about why urbanists need to talk about Amazon:

<blockquote>Amazon has made it their business model to make you think that way: they market themselves as your friendly, invisible big box store, with all of the benefits and none of the massive, concrete drawbacks of the K-Marts of the world that you’ve (rightly) come to distrust. All you see is the website, algorithmically manipulated to show you everything you want and need—and two days later, a little brown box on your doorstep with a smile printed on the side.</blockquote>

* Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, is [launching an interesting new news organization](https://www.wikitribune.com/). I don't know if Wikitribune will actually work, but it's always worth your attention when people try new models of journalism.

* The bookstore that trolled Piers Morgan on Twitter is now [in the middle of a crowdfunding campaign](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2017/04/24/london_s_big_green_bookshop_is_waging_a_twitter_campaign_to_save_itself.html) to stay open.

* This 2011 video of a carwash for books is making the rounds on Twitter and it's so terrific that you should watch it again:
