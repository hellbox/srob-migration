* It has been, to say the least, a crazy week. Locally, everybody is running for mayor. Nationally, our president's brain seems to be degrading at an alarming rate. So let's end the week with a piece of unabashed good news and a pair of excellent poems by Seattle poets, okay? Be good to yourself — and the moms in your life — this weekend. Spend a few hours at a bookstore. Read a book. Don't go on the internet on Mother's Day.

* Seattle poet Jane Wong recorded part of her poem "Pastoral Power" with KUOW. It's lovely and [you can listen to it here](http://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=528028469:528028485).

* Cody Walker's book of Trump-inspired poems *The Trumpiad*, which I [reviewed last week](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/stand-up-poetry/), has already [raised $1,368.60 for the ACLU, Walker reported yesterday on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10106506817672128&set=a.633120035318.2347599.10735848&type=3&theater). You can do your part by picking up a copy at Open Books this weekend.

* [Lit Hub published an incredibly moving poem](http://lithub.com/eulogy-a-poem-by-sherman-alexie/) from Sherman Alexie's upcoming memoir *You Don't Have to Say You Love Me*.
