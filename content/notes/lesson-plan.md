Let’s practice getting under the desk.<br>
Let’s practice barricading the door, turning the blinds<br>
in our eyes. Shhh now. Let’s demonstrate<br>
in utter silence. Every desk is a bunker in disguise.

I must have walked a hundred miles<br>
in a single afternoon. No one followed,<br>
pacing myself. Sunlight stained the leaves like glass.<br>
Vine maples tangled in an avalanche of shine.

The protocol is not what you think.<br>
The protocol is run hide fight. Step by step<br>
the trail cut from granite<br>
bleached and gleaming, strewn like the bones

of old calamity. Varied thrush<br>
or rush hour radio, call note drowsy like a long fuse,<br>
like pure denotation. Sometimes I hear guns<br>
in the valley &mdash; pick-up trucks, tin cans, shattered bottles,

trigger trash. Sometimes I hear bullets<br>
marching down the hall. Today there is no question<br>
and answer. Today is only multiple choice &mdash;<br>
the field trip wire lying in wait, mare’s tails combing the ridge

like movie weather. Crescendo of mountain.<br>
Is this a classroom or a mortuary? Who can catch<br>
a bullet in the mouth? Bullet points for extra credit.<br>
Bullets for teeth, for the all above.
