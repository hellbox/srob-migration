Cecilia Woloch, whose most recent poetry collection was from Washington publisher [Two Sylvias Press](http://www.twosylviaspress.com/index.html), has a wonderful poem in the [*New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/07/magazine/wild-common-prayer-cecilia-woloch.html?_r=0) today. "Wild Common Prayer" is a poem with long, luxurious lines about an encounter with a familiar friend in uncertain territory. It's definitely worth a lunchtime investigation.
