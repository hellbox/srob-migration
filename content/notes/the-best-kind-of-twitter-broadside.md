Looking for some Sunday inspiration? Maria Dahvana Headley, author most recently of _Magnolia_, wrote a seventeen tweet mini-essay on women’s agency in the arts. It’s personal, professional, gives good advice, and is about something near-and-dear to our hearts: writers being self-aware and claiming the time and space they need to create the best works they can.

[The whole thread is worth your time](https://twitter.com/mariadahvana/status/645677151610662912), but here are a few highlights that caught my eye:
