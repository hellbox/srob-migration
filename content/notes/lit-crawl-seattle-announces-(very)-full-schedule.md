Mark your calendars for Thursday, October 22nd — that's the date for Lit Crawl Seattle, the annual three-part literary pub crawl that happens all over downtown, Capitol Hill, and First Hill. Organizers at Lit Crawl just [announced their full schedule](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule) and it's ridiculously packed with local talent. There are scores of readers — somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 — and dozens of readings to suit just about every literary taste.

A tiny handful of event titles include the self-explanatory "Native Writers from Seattle & Beyond;" "Quick & Dirty: A Reading by [awesome local publisher] Shotgun Wedding;" "Sin Is Always In: Writings About Sex, Drugs, & Violence;" and "Late Night at the Library: Spooky Stories in the Stacks." Organizations headlining events include Hedgebrook, the APRIL Festival, the *James Franco Review*, *Poetry Northwest*, *Spartan*, Tin House, Instant Future, and *City Arts*. 

We'll be highlighting potential Lit Crawl routes for you in the weeks to come, but for right now, [go soak in the glorious too-muchness that is the complete Lit Crawl schedule](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2015-schedule). You've got plenty of time to figure out what you'll be doing on the night of the 22nd.
