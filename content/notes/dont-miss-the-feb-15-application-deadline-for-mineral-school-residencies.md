Applications for 2018 Mineral School residencies (and the six fellowships available to help cover costs) are due on February 15. Writers and visual artists who need a place to start something new or finish something big should leap on this: Mineral School is young, but rapidly gaining an ardent following. The setting is quirky and idyllic, the food is good, and the company is exceptional — just ask Clare Johnson, whose last round-up of Post-It Note art on this site [documented her experience at the program](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2018/01/05/decembers-post-it-note-art-from-instagram/).

Visit [our sponsorship page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) for more details and a link to the application form. Or meet Mineral School in person on January 28, at the Seattle Public Library's [Residencies Revealed event](https://www.facebook.com/events/327897661026328/?acontext=%7B%22ref%22%3A%223%22%2C%22ref_newsfeed_story_type%22%3A%22regular%22%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22null%22%7D). They'd be delighted to see you!
