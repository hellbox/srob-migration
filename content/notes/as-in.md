On the plane I whisper the travel prayer more softly<br>
I mouth the words but keep the breath carefully<br>
concealed in my throat, worried I donâ€™t have a permit<br>
for these verses in international airspace.

The prayer is filled with soft sounds<br>
_Ash-ha-du_ a tender hush, unlike<br>
the sharp hiss of _testify_. And the mess<br>
of vowels&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_la ilaa ha illaa_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wants breath<br>
it is difficult to keep this all inside.<br>
It is difficult to pray, and even more<br>
difficult to marvel or to rage.

_Allah_ was my go-to word<br>
for all the moments of the day<br>
the wonders<br>
as in<br>
(close your eyes and savor here)<br>
_Allaaaaah_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can you believe the fragrance of this gardenia?<br>
the colors of this sunset? How is it your lips<br>
are still as sweet as the first time?

and the transgressions<br>
as in<br>
(clench your fists and tremble here)<br>
_Allahu akbar!_<br>
Please help me survive this<br>
Please help me believe this will end<br>
Please help me trust there is some power<br>
greater than all this suffering.
