From the fine folks at [*Publishers Weekly*](http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/69388-bookstore-sales-had-first-gain-in-eight-years-in-2015.html?utm_source=Publishers+Weekly&utm_campaign=6db18d45d0-UA-15906914-1&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0bb2959cbb-6db18d45d0-304608685):

<blockquote>Bookstores sales rose 2.5% in 2015, marking the first time since 2007 that sales in the sector were up. According to preliminary figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau, total bookstore sales in 2015 hit **$11.17 billion, up from $10.89 billion in 2014**.</blockquote>

To celebrate, let's visit a few bookstores this weekend, okay?
