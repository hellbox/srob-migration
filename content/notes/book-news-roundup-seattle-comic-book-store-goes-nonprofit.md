* The [*Miami Herald* paints a (depressing) picture of the (depressing) library of the future](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/homestead/article131350924.html):

<blockquote><p>Virtual reality simulations, talking robots and a magic school bus — this is what happens when a theme park company designs a library.</p>

<p>Landmark Entertainment Group — the company responsible for the Spider-Man and Jurassic Park rides at Universal Orlando and Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas — has partnered with the city of Homestead to create the world’s first “Cybrary,” or cyber library.</p>

<p>“We are redefining what the library is,” said George Gretsas, Homestead’s city manager. “When you think about bettering this thing called a library, which has been around since before 300 B.C, do you turn to the library scientists — the librarians — to create a fresh and new thing, or do you turn to people who have expertise in the areas of entertainment and attraction?”</p></blockquote>
