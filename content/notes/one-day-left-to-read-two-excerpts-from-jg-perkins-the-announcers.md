Through Sunday, our sponsor Chatwin Books is allowing us run the introduction and a full chapter from J.G. Perkins' _The Announcers_. 

<blockquote>

Some are still asleep. Like many of the awakened, I found that my dream had elements of a nightmare. And while I treasure truth above all else, I envy those who are still dreaming.
