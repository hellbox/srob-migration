Is it presumptuous to say that book covers are on the whole better now — more attractive, more informative, less clichéd — than at any other time in history? I believe that to be true, but I'm probably setting myself up for some epic arguments in the near future. Still, [this retrospective on the life and work of H. Lawrence Hoffman](http://www.printmag.com/daily-heller/a-life-in-paperbacks-h-lawrence-hoffman/) inspires no small amount of nostalgia for the boom days of paperback books. Nobody is making anything quite like Hoffman's covers anymore, and that's kind of a shame. They're a little gaudy, sure, but they're great fun. I especially like the cover for *FOG*.
