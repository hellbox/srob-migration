<p class="intro">Each week, [Christine Larsen](http://christinelarsen.com) creates a portrait of a new author for us. Have any favorites youâ€™d love to see immortalized? [Let us know](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about)</p>

<p class="image">![](/webhook-uploads/1444945740743/SRoB_05_EileenMyles.jpg)</p>

Everybody's [talking about Eileen Myles](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/sorry-eileen-myles/) this week! That's because she'll be reading at [Elliott Bay Book Company on Saturday](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/eileen-myles). You should go see her. Until then, here she is with her dog, Honey.
