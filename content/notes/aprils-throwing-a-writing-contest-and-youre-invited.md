This morning, the [APRIL Festival announced something fun](http://www.aprilfestival.com/contest/): their first-ever writing contest! And the *Seattle Review of Books* is coming along for the ride:

<blockquote>The APRIL 2016 contest is simple: **submit a written piece of any genre or form, 400â€“500 words in length, before the December 12 deadline**. The APRIL team will select five finalists, with the winner to be selected by *The Seattle Review of Books*. The winning piece will be published on *The Seattle Review of Books* and performed during the APRIL 2016 festival and the winning author will be awarded a $100 honorarium. Please note that this contest is limited to those individuals who have NOT read at an APRIL event before.</blockquote>

There's no fee to enter, so send your best stuff along. We're very much looking forward to reading your work, and to publishing your work, and to attending your reading. Read [all the details here](http://www.aprilfestival.com/contest/).
