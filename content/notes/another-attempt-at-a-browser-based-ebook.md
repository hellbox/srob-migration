I've read plenty of ebooks on a Sony Reader and on my phone and my iPad, but I've never read a book on my laptop. [This book](http://poeticcomputation.info/contents/) is trying to be my first browser-based read:

<blockquote>*Poetic Computation: Reader* is an online-book by Taeyoon Choi that discusses code as a form of poetry and aesthetic while raising ethical questions associated with it.... Designed by HAWRAF, *Poetic Computation: Reader* presents new possibilities for enhanced accessibility and legibility in web browsers. Readers can change the design elements and format parameters to create their ideal reading experience.</blockquote>

This book, at the very least, is gorgeous. The design controls are easy to understand. And I'm interested in the idea of a book about the blurring lines between poetry and code. So we'll see how this goes.
