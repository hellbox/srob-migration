We may have been young and stupid<br>
We tried things this life<br>
We survived to tell or hold our tongue

I only wanted good teeth

It was the kind of day that kissed<br>
my adrenals, I was in love but didnâ€™t<br>
know, I forget his essential nature

Looking at altars I swim the undersea 

Our art, how we breathe it<br>
becomes our moment of forgiveness

Everything essential dies or disappears<br>
Fear takes us out of our body

I waited forever to sing

They wrote a song with ordinary<br>
words about an ordinary man<br>
I could not stand to listen

The whole world cries each day<br>
Let the bells ring
