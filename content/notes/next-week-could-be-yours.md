We have an [opening for a sponsor next week](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/). We'd love it to be you. We've had record traffic with our library coverage &mdash; you could reach out to that crowd to tell them about your book or event. People are starting to rely on the _Seattle Review of Books_ for literary coverage; your sponsorship would help make that possible.

*How's the sponsorship model going so far*? Really well! Out of 27 original weeks we opened in this block of availability, only 5 are left. We're ecstatic about this. We'd love to see that number go down and down, and [maybe with your help](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/) we can. 

Like we say every week, help us to make [internet advertising 100 percent less terrible](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/), and we promise that weâ€™ll make sure the sponsorships we show you are quality works that are interesting to you.
