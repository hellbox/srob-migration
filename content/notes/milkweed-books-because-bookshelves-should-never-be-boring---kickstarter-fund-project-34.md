<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Milkweed Books: Because Bookshelves Should Never Be Boring_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/628605595/milkweed-books-because-bookshelves-should-never-be). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Milkweed Editions](http://milkweed.org).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
Join us in opening a new nonprofit, independent bookstore where readers will discover the best independent literature.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	You know we have a soft spot for indie presses and small bookstores. Milkweed Editions, an indie publisher out of Minneapolis, wants to open a bookstore to feature their own books, as well as books from other presses. It will be a boutique store, filled with great books from great publishers, and friendly people to help you find them. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal. 
</p>

<p>
	As a non-profit press, Milkweed says its status "mandates that it operates to fulfill a mission rather than seek a profit," so they want the store to be a center of culture. Since it's in the [Open Books](http://www.openbookmn.org/) building (not, of course, our own local poetry only bookstore, but the literary arts center in Minneapolis), with access to a theater, amenities, and the traffic this resource draws, it's a smart place to have a smart store. Seems like the right place to build support for a resource like this.
</p>


<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	If you're not already sold, there are some good prizes. Bread, for example (yes, homemade, by an author of cookbooks), or a collection of all the 2016 poetry releases from Milkweed. Every bit you give helps, so find the prize that speaks to you and reach out for it. With your wallet. But, not really your wallet since you're on the computer. Maybe a digital version of your wallet? I dunno, maybe we need some new metaphors. Reach out with your digit-strings numbers of credit transference, and help them open the store.</p>
<p>And remember, it's a neighborly thing: the books community is small, and Minneapolis and Seattle have always had a close cultural connection. Let's show 'em it still exists.
	</p>


<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	at 54%, with 27 days left, they're off to a solid start, and on a good trajectory. No doubt they could use the help, though.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
