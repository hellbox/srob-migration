Our thanks to this week's sponsor Esther Altshul Helfgott. If you haven't had the chance to look through the excerpt from her book _Dear Alzheimer's_, [you should do so now](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships "The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships") &mdash; it will only be up through tomorrow. 

Helgott's journal of poetry and prose turned poignant when her husband Abe started feeling the effects of Alzheimer's. Her light touch, observational manner, and careful writing make this a moving journey. One full of life and discovery, despite the seriousness of the topic. I think you'll be glad you took the time to [read the excerpt we posted this week](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships "The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships").

We do things a bit differently around here. We have one sponsor a week, and they offer some of their work for you to read. You could do the same thing with your work, if you wanted.

It's all part of our attempt to make internet advertising [100 percent less terrible.](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/ "The Seattle Review of Books - Help us make internet advertisements 100 percent less terrible")
