like a heavy freight train<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is headed towards you,<br>
but you are running, tripping

over its tracks. You hope luck<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the taxi ready to pick you up,<br>
but luck’s the subway, luck’s

the bus with the accordion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;middle. You wait<br>
for luck, thought you bought

a ticket, thought the cab<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would stop. At the airport<br>
you hold a sign, _Welcome_

_Luck!_ But everyone passes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;luck passes, doesn’t stop,<br>
and you are left

with your sign and a moment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of hope when you think<br>
you’ve found luck

in your pocket, but luck is down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the street in the Horseshoe<br>
Tavern, so you peek inside

and see it &mdash; luck, in its shy suit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drinking a beer<br>
with your best friend,

and they are taking selfies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with their smartphones,<br>
and you holding

your paper map,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hoping luck would travel<br>
long distances to find you.
