I tell my therapist that I do not want to cry<br>
because it’s two in the afternoon

and there’s a turtle<br>
sunbathing on a felled tree

in the marsh outside of her office window.<br>
A Great Blue Heron hobbles close,

and it’s probable that the two are holding<br>
a silent confessional barred in by a community

of water lilies that are tethered to mire.<br>
She asks, how I feel when I talk

about home &mdash; I hold my rib cage close<br>
to her ear so she can hear the wind howl.
