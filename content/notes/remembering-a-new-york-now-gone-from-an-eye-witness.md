<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1482182403693/fay-webern.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">This week, Sagging Meniscus Press is back to show their new book from Fay Webern: _The Button Thief of East 14th Street: Stories from a Life on the Lower East Side 1927-1957_. It's an captivating work that captures New York at a vital time, seen from the inside.</p>

We have a full, long chapter on our <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">sponsorâ€™s page</a>, but we're embedding a YouTube video here, as well, of Webern reading a short chapter called "The Pretzel Lady at Union Square". We love her stories, and love hearing her tell them. 

<p>Sponsors like Sagging Meniscus make the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> possible. Did you know you could sponsor us, as well?
