<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_The Essential W.S. Merwin_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/896286441/the-essential-ws-merwin?ref=category_recommended). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Copper Canyon Press](http://www.coppercanyonpress.org/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
Help Copper Canyon Press publish the definitive collection of W.S. Merwinâ€™s poetry.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>
	
<p class="noindent">
	This is the third Kickstarter from the one-and-only <a href="https://www.coppercanyonpress.org" title="Copper Canyon Press. A nonprofit publisher dedicated to poetry.">Copper Canyon Press</a>. It's hard to overstate their importance in modern poetry, and how lucky we are that they are a Northwest institution &mdash; their reputation, and history of stellar work, raise us all. 

</p>

Their first Kickstarter was for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/896286441/the-lost-poems-of-pablo-neruda?ref=profile_created" title="The Lost Poems of Pablo Neruda by Copper Canyon Press &amp;mdash; Kickstarter">rare poems from a dead poet</a>, the second (which we backed) <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/896286441/new-poets-project?ref=profile_created" title="Copper Canyon Press: New Poets Project by Copper Canyon Press &amp;mdash; 
Kickstarter">was for new poets</a>. Fitting, then, that the third is for a well-awarded poet still with us.

Perhaps you are not familiar with the Pulitzer (two of them!) winning, US Poet Laureate WS Merwin. Perhaps you know his work well and have followed him for years. But either way, backing this project to create a collection of his work will cement his work for years to come. 

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
We always do our best to back local poets and publishers, so that's the first thing. Second is recognizing the history and accomplishments of a living poet whose work has had such depth and reach. Merwin deserves the kind of audience that a project like this can bring. Think about how many poets you've discovered through their collected or essential works?
</p>


<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	28% there and 26 days to go. They're just getting started, now is a great time to grab a copy of the book for yourself.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
