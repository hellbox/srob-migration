The Seattle Review of Books *will launch our readings calendar in the fall. (These things take time to do right!) But until that happens, every Monday we’ll highlight the best readings/literary events/talks/book clubs happening in Seattle — one event for each day of the week. (The above photo is of local author Doug Nufer and his dog. Nufer is on the right.)*

**Monday**: The week opens on a promising note as Seattle’s literary godmother, Nancy Pearl, [appears in conversation with the novelist Mary Doria Russell](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=03&evyear=2015&eventid=2014111412144000) at University Book Store. Russell, in case you didn’t know, is the author of the excellent novel *The Sparrow*, which brought religion to the sci-fi novel in the most thoughtful, rewarding way possible. That was a long time ago. Now, she’s the author of a pair of historical novels—the first is about Doc Holliday, the newest is about Wyatt Earp. Pearl is a terrific interviewer, and Russell undoubtedly now has a metric ton of facts about the American west in her brain thanks to years of intensive research. This should be a fun conversation.

**Tuesday**: We at *The Seattle Review of Books* love Town Hall for their readings series, of course, but they also provide important community engagement sessions at key moments. [This is one such moment](https://townhallseattle.org/event/the-continuing-fight-for-lgbtq-equality/): in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to make same-sex marriage legal across the United States, representatives from Lambda Legal, the ACLU of Washington, Legal Voice, and QLaw Foundation will lead a discussion about “the current state of LGBTQ equality, and examine key areas where there’s still work to be done.” It’s easy to forget, in moments of celebration, that we’re still so far from where we need to be. This is a great opportunity to plan the way we move forward.

**Wednesday**:  Rebecca Makkai, author of  the novels *The Borrower* and *The Hundred-Year House*, will read from her new book of short stories, *Music for Wartime*, [at Elliott Bay Book Company](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/rebecca-makai). *The Seattle Review of Books* hasn’t read this book, but Makkai is a frequent contributor to the Best American Short Stories series, for whatever that’s worth, and Pam Houston can’t slather enough praise on Makkai. That makes this free reading absolutely worth your time.

**Thursday**: It’s always exciting when a Seattle author debuts her first book. And this debut looks to be a doozy: Sonya Lea’s memoir *Wondering Who You Are* is the latest production of the exceptional Portland publisher Tin House. The book is about what happens when Lea’s husband suffers a medical emergency that leaves him with no memory of their life together. [Hugo House throws a party for Lea tonight](http://hugohouse.org/event/book-launch-party-for-sonya-leas-wondering-who-you-are/), with a reading and signing and guest appearances from other local authors.

**Friday**: [Up in Lake Forest Park](http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/lfp-jesse-goolsby-id-wal-my-friends-if-i-could-find-them), Third Place Books hosts Jesse Goolsby, author of *I’d Walk With My Friends if I Could Find Them*. It’s a debut novel. Third Place’s press copy describes the plot thusly: “three American soldiers haunted by their actions in Afghanistan search for absolution and human connection in family and civilian life.”


**Saturday**: This weekend, local Oulipian treasure Doug Nufer is hosting two readings. Saturday’s reading is a new iteration of Nufer’s popular [Barrom Writers Offensive](http://www.duwamishrevealed.com/event/the-barroom-writers-offensive/), and it takes place in Georgetown “and the water.” We’re informed that “ there will be a shuttle service from the Georgetown Art Attack.” More readings should take on the energy and mystery of a good kidnapping, I always say. (Sunday, [Nufer will be performing with jazz saxophonist Wally Shoup](http://www.duwamishrevealed.com/event/doug-nufer-wally-shoup/) at the Lower Duwamish Superfund Site, as part of the ongoing Duwamish Revealed art festival, too.)

**Sunday**: Ada’s Technical Books is hosting their [third annual celebration of R. Buckminster Fuller’s birthday](http://www.seattletechnicalbooks.com/3rd-annual-buckminster-fuller-birthday-celebration-l-steven-sieden). Not enough mainstream attention has gone to Fuller, the geodesic dome fetishist and utopian thinker, and Ada’s earns a special place in our hearts for keeping the torch lit in Fulller’s name. The bookstore will celebrate Fuller’s birthday with a presentation by Fuller scholar L. Steven Sieden, a Q&A, and “a special birthday treat.” What better way to end a week, we ask you, than with a special birthday treat? None. There is no better way to end a week.
