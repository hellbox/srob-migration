<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday, February 5: Thrilling Tales**</h5></p>

The downtown Seattle Public Library hosts a lunch-period storytime for adults two times a month. It’s a chance for grownups to leave the office, relax and hand over their attention to someone else for a while. Todays’ short story selection was written by San Diego sci-fi author Greg Bear. It’s titled "Blood Music,” and it’s one of his beset-known works.
*Seattle Public Library, 1000 4th Ave., 386-4636, http://spl.org, 12:05 pm, free.*
