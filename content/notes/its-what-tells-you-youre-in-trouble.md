On paper there is a woman and a heart. On<br>
another, something is missing from a hand.<br>
These are not metaphors. Weight becomes<br>
a unit of measurement. Here. The point<br>
of origin is here. Hands suspended<br>
next to your skin is here. But that ends<br>
here. Next to overturned boats and a drum<br>
that can hold chemicals strong enough<br>
to dissolve a body, but not dissolve itself.
