I need bread for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br>
Sweet grain, salted grain, I want so much<br>
To swallow you whole. I'm a damn sinner

Who can only be saved by your fingers.<br>
Hurry, place the sacred bread on my tongue<br>
And consecrate breakfast, lunch, and dinner &mdash;

Or maybe not. I wish I were slimmer<br>
And more disciplined &mdash; a secular monk!<br>
But I lust, lust and lust. I'm a sinner

Who seeds, threshes, harvests, feasts, and shivers.<br>
Forgive me. Condemn me. I need flesh and blood<br>
And bread at each breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

I know I want too much. I know what hinders<br>
And troubles you. But join me in this flood.<br>
Look at me. I'm your beloved sinner.

Sit with me. Please. Let's talk. Please. Linger.<br>
Let's touch and eat everything that we touch.<br>
Let us stay through breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br>
Sweetheart, it's your turn to be the sinner.
