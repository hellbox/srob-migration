<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Modern Filipino Children's Stories: Sari-Sari Storybooks_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1438429130/modern-filipino-childrens-stories-sari-sari-storyb?ref=category_recommended). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Christina Newhard](http://www.sarisaristorybooks.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
These gorgeously illustrated picture books bring Filipino stories to the world. Printed + media-rich digital books.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	This project seeks to publish books in more Filipino languages than just English or Tagalog. As she says in the video, there are 181 languages in a country the size of Florida (update: Christina contacted us to say Arizona is a better match than Florida, and she's correcting the video to say so), and by creating books in some of those other languages, it both reinforces the local cultures, while also sharing them with the world â€” since each book will also be translated into English. 
</p>


<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	Besides the altruistic drive of the creation, the books look amazing. I remember, as a kid, reaching out into other cultures through their stories, learning about the experiences of children far different than my white suburban childhood. But just wanting to expand a child's horizon isn't enough, it has to be done well. From the looks of it, these books are well written, nicely illustrated, and well presented. It's a great concept presented well. 
	</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	71% funded with 24 days to go. Wouldn't it be great to see them hit a total home run?
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
