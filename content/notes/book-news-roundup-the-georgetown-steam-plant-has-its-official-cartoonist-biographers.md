* In the midst of [all the exciting City of Literature news yesterday](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/10/31/seattle-designated-a-unesco-city-of-literature-the-world-is-looking-at-seattle-as-a-cultural-leader/), this piece of news didn't get the attention it deserves: [David Lasky and Mairead Case have been selected](http://artbeat.seattle.gov/2017/10/31/historic-georgetown-steam-plant-powers-graphic-novel/) to create a fictionalized graphic novel about the beautiful old Georgetown Steam Plant. (We [told you about the open call for Seattle cartoonists](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/06/06/book-news-roundup-want-50000-dollars-to-make-a-graphic-novel/) five months ago.) Case and Lasky will be blogging about the experience of creating the graphic novel on the new site [Steam Plant Graphic Novel: The Blog!](http://steamplantgraphicnovel.com/) Bookmark that site, now; it should be an interesting look into the research and process of two of Seattle's finest cartooning talents.

* If the blog is interesting enough, I hope someone adapts it into a theatrical experience called "Steam Plant Graphic Novel: The Blog!: The Musical!"

* Also in the midst of yesterday's UNESCO hullabaloo — UNESCOBALOO? — [Martin McClellan wrote a piece on this site announcing an amazing new literary award](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/10/31/poetry-northwest-launches-the-joan-swift-memorial-prize-for-women-poets-over-the-age-of-65/) for women poets over the age of 65. The prize, sponsored by *Poetry Northwest*, honors the life and legacy of brilliant Seattle poet Jane Swift.

* [Congressperson Pramila Jayapal is now choosing monthly book club picks at Third Place Books!](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=third%20place%20books%20pramila) Her first selection is Claudia Rankine's excellent *Citizen*, which [I reviewed back in January](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/a-room-full-of-citizens/) after we discussed it for the Reading Through It Book Club. This is a great way for an elected official to stay in touch with her district. 

* *SRoB* tipper **Levi** points out [the news that the movie rights to un-prolific Seattle cartoonist Nate Simpson's comic *Nonplayer* has been bought by Legendary Entertainment](http://deadline.com/2017/10/nonplayer-movie-legendary-entertainment-eric-pearson-writing-thor-ragnarok-1202195649/). The first issue of *Nonplayer* came out in 2011, and the second issue came out in 2015. Just because the movie rights have sold don't mean an actual movie will be made, but the odds are pretty good that a movie version will come out before the fourth issue of *Nonplayer* hits the stands.

* And *SRoB* tipper **Doug** wants you to see this tribute to literary maestro Harry Mathews, who passed away in January of this year:
