From the other-sided, alee the valley; to give what you want &mdash;<br>
says the mentor, irreparably. As pretense gets wrecked like a<br>
photograph. As we haunt eternally.

It's hard to tell.<br>
Do we?

Cold guy drifts in cold veins, this nightly swim.<br>
So I overheard in LA, grab a shovel, LA is dead.<br>
_Nothing is Real_. Lame, 

I know. Ask if there's proof.<br>
Of life, if not for death's warming the carpet living room.

I'm officially bored with weed,<br>
as if a backpack with nothing in it. As if I hope the world is done<br>
sleeping in synchronicities. 

Are there heavenly capillaries networking? Blacked-out to neon.<br>
Who is recording<br>
our untitled hallucinations: washed up on the amethystine sea he plunged,

and what of the notes nailed to the roof with a gun? Days of<br>
noise funneling into the hollows<br>
of my hips. A lot of beating hearts out there. As they say, _imitation_<br>
_is suicide_, you lowlife.
