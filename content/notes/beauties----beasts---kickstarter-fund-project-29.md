<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Beauties / Beasts_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/babytattoo/beauties-beasts?ref=category_recommended). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Baby Tattoo](http://babytattoo.com).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>A sexy combination of Pinups and Creatures from world-renowned artist Olivia De Berardinis and master monster-maker Jordu Schell!

</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	Olivia is the most well-respected living pinup artist. Jordu Schell is a master monster sculptor, who has worked on dozens of movies, making creatures we love to hate. This book brings together their art to explore the trope of beauty and the beast &mdash; both artists see them as an expression of fantasy. 
</p>

As a man who <a href="http://californiafouroclock.com" title="California Four O&amp;rsquo;Clock by Martin McClellan">wrote a novel about pinups</a>, Olivia (like photographer Bunny Yeager before her) has always been fascinating to me, because of the different approach women have to creating sexualized, idealized imagery of women. "I'm looking for a very confident, sensual, sexual woman who is not impeded by any second thoughts, like I am," she says in the video.

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	If you're into movie monsters, or the work of filmmakers like Guillermo del Toro, you'll find a lot to love in the beautifully shot monster masks. If you're also into pinup artwork, then you'll the combination probably pretty hard to resist. The book itself look gorgeous, nicely designed and packaged, and a hardcover signed by both artists is only $50.
</p>


<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	They're about 50% funded with 27 days to go. Looks like they're on a good trajectory, but you could help assure that they make it.
