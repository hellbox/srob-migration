I'm thrilled to hear that the great Spokane alternative weekly the *Inlander* — which, full disclosure, [publishes my writing](http://www.inlander.com/spokane/ArticleArchives?author=2523577) sometimes — is [planning a poetry issue](http://www.inlander.com/Bloglander/archives/2016/10/05/submit-your-creative-verses-for-the-inlanders-first-poetry-issue). And if you live in eastern Washington, they want you to send your poetry to them sometime before November 20th. They will publish roughly a dozen poems, with each poet receiving $40 for their work. Many thanks to the *Inlander* for supporting local poetry; I can't wait to read this issue.

(*Thanks to* SRoB *tipper **Hannah** for the tip*.)
