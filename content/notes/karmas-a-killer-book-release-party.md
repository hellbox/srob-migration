This Saturday, <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">sponsor Tracy Weber</a> is throwing a release party for the third book in the Downward Dog Mystery series, and she'd love it if you came by. The new book, _Karma's a Killer_, follows heroine and Seattle yoga instructor Kate Davidson and her onery German shepherd Bella, as they encounter yet another impossible situation that only Kate can solve. 

<a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">Read a full chapter from _Karma's a Killer_ on our sponsors page</a>, and make sure to mark your calendar for this Saturday January 23rd, from 2:30-4:00pm, and join Tracy at [Whole Life Yoga](http://www.wholelifeyoga.com) on Greenwood. 

Because of sponsors like Tracy, we have the money to pay for the content you see here every day. All we ask is that you read a free chapter from her book, and if you like it, considering picking up a copy of her book, or dropping by her party.
