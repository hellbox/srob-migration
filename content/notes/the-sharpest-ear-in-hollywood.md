You've heard Artie Kane, even if you haven't heard of him. Kane spent decades in Hollywood, composing, conducting, and playing the music to a dizzying number of television shows (*Wonder Woman*!) and movies (*Eyes of Laura Mars*!) — and along the way, hobnobbing with the giants of the entertainment industry.

[Amphora Editions](https://amphoraeditions.com/), a small publisher with a penchant for the odd and beautiful, is sponsoring us this week to give you an inside look at Kane's new memoir, *Music to My Years*: a candid and wryly witty account of his life and adventures in entertainment. The [sample chapter on our sponsorship page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) includes cameos by Jascha Heifetz, and Lionel Newman, among others. Stop by and spend a few minutes in 70s-era Hollywood with one of Hollywood's great working musicians.
