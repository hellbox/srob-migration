Eugene M. Babb spent a life in gigs, and then wrote about it. His book _Grit and Roses_, published by <a href="http://thirdplacepress.com" title="Third Place Press | Home | Print on demand and self publishing services">Third Place Press</a> (yes! <a href="http://www.thirdplacebooks.com" title="Third Place Books | Books, community, events and more">Third Place books</a> has a press! They print books on their Espresso Book Machine, Ginger), covers his thirty years of life as a working musician. 

We have two expcerpts from this short, sharply told book <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">on our sponsors page</a>. How wonderful to have a local author, published by a local press, as a sponsor this week. We loved the work, and thin, you will too. 

And thanks to Babb and Third Place Press, we're able to bring you the content we do every day.
