Did you know that the good folks at Humanities Washington publish a magazine called *Spark*? It's true! and [the latest issue of *Spark* is now online in PDF form](https://www.humanities.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/HW_Spark_FallWinter2017_LO.pdf). In this issue, you'll find a new poem from Sherman Alexie, a history of Washington literature as told in 14 books, a discussion of the long history of fake news, and a new short story by Spokane author Jess Walter. It has a fantastic first sentence:

<blockquote>Your goddam kids wanna send *you* to the booby hatch?</blockquote>
