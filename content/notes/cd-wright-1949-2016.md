The Arkansas-born poet who published with Copper Canyon Press [died unexpectedly](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2016/01/c-d-wright-1949-2016/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+HarrietTheBlog+(Harriet%3A+The+Blog) yesterday. She was a MacArthur "Genius" award winner and a giant on the American poetry scene. You can find some remembrances of her life and work by [Max Brantley](http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2016/01/13/cd-wright-arkansas-native-poet-dies-at-67) and [Rich Smith](http://www.thestranger.com/blogs/slog/2016/01/13/23417447/in-praise-of-poet-cd-wright), and there will undoubtedly be more in the days and weeks ahead.

For right now, I'd like to send your attention to a recording of Wright reading her own poem "[Everything Good Between Men and Women](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/177350)" at the Poetry Foundation. It's a loud, lively, even raucous poem that starts with a bang (the title flows dircectly into the opening lines, "has been written in mud and butter/and barbecue sauce") and concludes with a demand for the reader to "Call it a night. O soul. Flow on. Instead." That's a powerful demand from a poet to her audience, and tonight it feels like something more: sad, encouraging, raw. It feels like an invocation, a demand, and a love letter all at once.
