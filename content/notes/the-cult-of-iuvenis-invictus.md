<em style="font-size:16px;font-family:SeravekLightItalic">(for Abbey, Belle, Circa, Fiddleback, Fritz, Oscar, Sideway, Toast, and Zan)</em>

The Vixen pinks his way through whiskers,<br>
strikes a nice plié,<br>
then knocks a shot of Jäger back,<br>
and drops some Fourier.

The shaven Lion shyly strides<br>
beside his own conceit:<br>
a guileless wilding<br>
twice defiled, but innocent and sweet.

Mama Panda and her Pup<br>
(wily as Montaigne)<br>
splay their limbs in slick abandon,<br>
rolling through the rain. 

She's a powder-hounded faun<br>
with talcum in her eyes &mdash;<br>
he's Dauphin of Malcontrites:<br>
: the locus of surprise.

The Kangaroo who used to wear<br>
a Fox's gold lapel<br>
casts himself on infant seas<br>
and rides each roll and swell

Rainbow Rat, the dayglo champ<br>
of pan-harmonium<br>
wriggles in a bedsty tizzy,<br>
nursing at his thumb.

The Folf-cum-Husky's snugly tucked<br>
and tangled up in blue<br>
and white and glows so bright<br>
he turns the old moon new.

Even Wolves, who play at stern<br>
and sober countenance,<br>
lose themcells in padded selves<br>
and capillary dance:

though shadows blaze through every day<br>
and coruscate the night,<br>
we learn to see beyond the darkness<br>
by each other's light.
