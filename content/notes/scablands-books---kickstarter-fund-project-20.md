<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">_[Scablands Books](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/scablands-books/x/13901556#/)_. We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Sharma Shields](http://sharmashields.net).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>Help us publish the poetry collections of local writers Ellen Welcker and Tim Greenup!</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you're a regular reader of the _Seattle Review of Books_, or a fan of Northwest writing, you know Sharma Shields. She's <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/sharma-shields/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sharma Shields">written for us</a>, and is the author of the novel _<a href="http://thesasquatchhuntersalmanac.com/" title="The Sasquatch Hunter&#x27;s Almanac: A Novel by Sharma Shields - Excerpt">The Sasquatch Hunter's Almanac</a>_, and the short story collection _Favorite Monster_.
</p>

This project by her is all about publishing poetry collections from fellow inland Northwest writers Ellen Welcker and Tim Greenup. 

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">Local pride, for one. Spokane has a burgoning lit scene, and that's great to see. Also, the money is to make the books right, from paying the poets a good rate, to hiring designers to lay them out right. Here's to small publishers in Spokane!</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">They're 42% funded currently, with less than $1400 pledged of their $8k goal.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
