* ZAPP, the Zine Archive and Publishing Project that was formerly based out of Hugo House but which is now looking for a permanent home for its library, is [looking for submissions](https://www.facebook.com/shortrunseattle/posts/1046861722033543) for its next issue of *Xenographic*, its quarterly publication. The theme is "IRL/URL," and they accept prose, poetry, fiction, non-fiction, illustrations, and photographs. Send your submissions to info@zappseattle.org by August 9th.

* Bitch Media, the organization that publishes the indispensible *Bitch* magazine, is [now accepting applications for fellowships](https://bitchmedia.org/article/announcing-bitch-media-fellowships-writers#.V5-yqGMOIrc.twitter) which encourage writers to explore themes of reproductive rights & justice, pop-culture criticism, technology, and global feminism. 

<blockquote>This fellowship was created in order to cultivate and amplify new voices. If you are a writer who has minimal publication experience, we strongly encourage you to apply. If you are passionate about one of the above subject areas but do not have a history of writing or blogging about them, we strongly encourage you to apply. If you are a writer still figuring out what subjects obsess you, we strongly encourage you to apply. </blockquote>

* If you're sick of reading things written by humans, good news! There's now a literary magazine that will [publish works written by artificial intelligence](https://electricliterature.com/do-androids-submit-to-electric-lit-mags-a-new-journal-publishes-poems-by-computers-e4b2c3d86a64#.8dpsiqes2).

* Lindy West [tackled that problematic Jonathan Franzen interview](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/02/jonathan-franzens-lack-of-black-friends-is-unsettling-but-its-hardly-unusual-in-white-america) from yesterday:

<blockquote>It’s a strikingly honest inversion of the cliche that white people usually reach for when asked pointed questions about race – “Some of my best friends are black!” – yet somehow more unsettling in its complacency. I don’t know these people, Franzen is telling us. These are not my people. I know enough to be embarrassed but I do not care enough to change.</blockquote>
