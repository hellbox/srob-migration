Or maybe you were frustrated, <a href="https://twitter.com/ava/status/918718017030168578" title="Ava DuVernay on Twitter: &amp;quot;Calling white women allies to recognize conflict of #WomenBoycottTwitter for women of color who haven&amp;#39;t received support on similar issues.&amp;quot;">like Ava DuVeray</a>, that it was only when a white woman was banned that people started speaking up, when women of color have been reporting this behavior for years. 
</p>

Which sums the problem up nicely: Twitter doesn't listen. Or, they listen and don't care. Or, they care and are somehow so bound to &mdash; Metrics? Engagement? Shareholders? Satan? &mdash; _something_, that they cannot fix this problem. So it sure feels like Twitter isn't listening, and the only way to make them listen is stop using their service. 

Or, to put a fine point on it, stop giving them the content, for free, that they then sell advertising against. On Twitter, as the saying goes, you are the product. It was an okay trade-off when you were meeting interesting people and making friends, but, that wasn't everybody's experience. <a href="http://arielwaldman.com/2008/05/22/twitter-refuses-to-uphold-terms-of-service/" title="Ariel Waldman  &amp;raquo; Twitter refuses to uphold Terms of Service">Ariel Waldman wrote about Twitter being unwilling to uphold their TOS</a> in 2008, just a year-and-a-half after the service's launch. Six years before Gamergate became, as many have pointed out, a trial balloon for the kind of networked harassment that lead to the organized silencing of women and liberals under the Trump campaign. 

And lest you think these things are not connected, the man who, kind of openly, but still allegedly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Sierra" title="Kathy Sierra - Wikipedia">harassed the amazing Kathy Sierra</a> off the internet in 2007 has come out fully as a white supremacist. Previously, he claimed it was all about the lulz. It probably is, to him, as is his belief that anybody without his skin is substandard. 

So I'm dedicating today's prompts to some what-ifs. A peek into another dimension of what could have been. Maybe it's just progressive dreaming, but since we're apparently on the alternate timeline where pretty much everything is going wrong, progressive dreaming seems to be all we have left. 


<h5>Today's prompts</h5>

1. The first response was so rude she couldn't believe it was real. Who could have that big of a problem with her tweet about a comic book? By the time the fiftieth response showed up, she shut down Twitter and went to bed. In the morning, fearing to look, she saw her response timeline was clean, and there was a DM for her from support. "Looks like some jerk sent a bot army your way. We've banned them and cleaned up their mess. So sorry to disrupt your right to express yourself on our platform. We think your actual voice is so much more valuable than trolls."

2. The cop, broom mustache, wide-set brow, asked her "and where did this threat come from?" — "He posted it on Twitter" — "And you are sure it's your ex?" — "Pretty sure, yeah." — "And this was on...how did you say it? Twitter?" — "Yes." — "What's that?" — "It's a website for publishing thoughts." — "Okay. I don't know much about the internet, but obviously, all of these accounts have real people behind them, and we take any threats very seriously. I'll work with our technology team to request IP addresses and personal information on your harasser so that we can verify it is your ex and build up a case against him before he escalates into violence against your person."

3. She tweeted "love Twitter! Got this mail today." Attached was a picture of the email. "We noticed that you're friends with a lot of people who have suffered harassment on our platform. We've taken the liberty of hiding your tweets from some people who react too strongly to content, we hope that helps you feel safe and able to express yourself on our platform without fear of harassment."

4. That bitch. He was gonna teach her a lesson. He went to 4chan and posted a picture of her, and her address. "Help me dox this piece of trash," he wrote. "I dunno," came a quick reply. "The last guy who did this got arrested by the FBI, even though he was going through TOR. I guess these services really take harassment seriously and shut it down before it could grow into anything major."

5. <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/919028953284673536" title="jack on Twitter: &amp;quot;4/ Today we saw voices silencing themselves and voices speaking out because weâre *still* not doing enough.&amp;quot;">@jack woke in a cold sweat, again</a>.
