After Seattle and San Diego, Portland gets the "honor" of hosting the third [Amazon Books brick-and-mortar store](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/09/the-algorithm-method/). 

<blockquote>“We are excited to be bringing Amazon Books to Washington Square, and we are currently hiring store managers and associates. Stay tuned for additional details down the road.”</blockquote>

Who's going to be the first person to [showroom a book at Portland's Amazon Books](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/11/06/independent-bookstore-fan-showrooms-amazon-books/) and buy it from Powell's?
