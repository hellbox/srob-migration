* Hugo House is very close to moving in to their new home in the old location — the sign is up! — but they still need to raise a little cash before they can settle in. Right now, they've announced that they've got a Challenge Match of $100,000. "That means every dollar donated will be doubled," [an email from the House announced](https://mailchi.mp/hugohouse/new-hugo-house-challenge-match?e=eb1b2e904f). If you haven't given, now is a great time. And if you only have five bucks to spare, you'll actually be donating ten bucks. 

* [Colson Whitehead's AMA on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/878ytl/im_author_colson_whitehead_just_another_down_on/) is full of all kinds of great answers, including his answer to the beloved Reddit question "would you rather fight 50 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck?" Whitehead's response to that question, in particular, is the only correct one.

* [Sean fucking Penn thinks he's a novelist now](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sean-penn-bob-honey-who-just-do-stuff-review_us_5ab9a1bee4b008c9e5fa89a2?f6p), and his book includes a poem about #MeToo. Like everything else Sean Penn does, it's gross. I vow to never review this book.

* Have you heard of *Teen Bo$$* magazine? If not, [I'm sorry to do this to you](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-very-unnerving-existence-of-teen-boss-a-magazine-for-girls).

* [This job description](http://paulbogaards.tumblr.com/post/172350356897/im-looking-to-hire-a-publicist) is the shocking truth about being a book publicist.

* Good headline: "[Ursula K. Le Guin‘s Folk/Electronica Album Can Teach Us a Lot About Storytelling](https://electricliterature.com/ursula-k-le-guin-music-and-poetry-of-kesh-c65c1f14cb83)."
