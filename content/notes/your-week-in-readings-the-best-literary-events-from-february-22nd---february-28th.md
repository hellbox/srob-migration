<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday February 22nd: *The Burning World* Reading**</h5></p> 
Hardcore zombie purists may not love Isaac Marion's young adult novel *Warm Bodies* — zombies who can *talk*? Sacrilege! — but everyone else seems to have fallen pretty hard. In the new sequel, the semi-alive protagonist learns how to reconnect with the human race and come to terms with his past.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday February 23rd: Faggots in the Stacks**</h5></p> 
Likely due to its controversial name, the listing for this book group warns that “this event is not officially sponsored or endorsed by the Seattle Public Library.” Officially endorsed or not, it’s a must-attend discussion of Martin Duberman’s *Hold Tight Gently*, a true story of two artists during the AIDS epidemic.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday February 27th: Gaslighting in Government**</h5></p> 
 Two UW professors (David Domke, a communications expert, and Christopher Sebastian Parker, who specializes in political science) will talk with a mental health professional to discuss the idea of gaslighting — the imposing of a false reality upon an innocent victim who gradually accepts the fiction as real— and how that relates to the Trump administration.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday February 28th: Bridges Not Walls**</h5></p> 
 Many Seattleites will be attending the reading from George Saunders for his debut novel *Lincoln in the Bardo* at Town Hall tonight. But this event, which features Seattle authors like Donna Miscola and Kathleen Alcalá, deserves your attention as well. This event is designed to examine who deserves a platform, and who you’re silencing when you speak. Seems appropriate for the time.
