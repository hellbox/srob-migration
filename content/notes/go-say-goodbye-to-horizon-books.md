Long ago, the Ada's Technical Books space on 15th Ave used to be a used bookstore called Horizon Books. In [2009, Horizon moved](http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2009/02/horizon-books-closing/) to an underground space on 10th Avenue between Pike and Pine. And now, this message from Horizon bookseller Don Glover started circulating on social media:

<blockquote>Fellow booksellers, friends, and long time customers, It's come that time, to finally close the shutters, and hinge the doors of Horizon Books, but it's been a grand run these past 47 years. Come join us for one last jaunt - 50% off sale through July, with deeper discounts through August, and always a deal to be made if you're loading up. 1423 10th Ave Studio A - Between Pike and Union, down the loading ramp, in the basement level, open most days 12pm-5pm. Feel free and give Don a ring at 206 523 4217, and stop on in.</blockquote>

Horizon is one of those bookstores that will horrify people with OCD tendencies: if the shelves were ever alphabetized, you'd never know it now. But Glover knows his stock well, and if you're looking for a particular subject, odds are good he can help you find it. It's always sad when an eccentric bookstore closes, but I don't want to get too maudlin over Horizon closing: 50 years of bookselling is quite an achievement. Go enjoy what you've got while it's still there.
