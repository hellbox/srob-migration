This year's Nobel Prize for literature will be announced on October 13th, which is later than usual for weird calendar reasons. [This piece at The Local](https://www.thelocal.se/20160930/nobel-literature-prize-announcement-pushed-back) says the betting markets think Haruki Murakami is a favorite to win the prize this year. Since Philip Roth retired, Haruki Murakami has always topped the betting markets, and — spoiler alert — he has never won the Nobel Prize. (Neither has Roth, for that matter, and he was the favorite for at least a decade before Murakami took over the position.) Betting markets are notoriously bad for this sort of thing. Some financial advice from the *Seattle Review of Books*: **do not bet on arts awards for financial gain**. You will likely lose your shirt. Just wait until the 13th to find out who wins with the rest of us.
