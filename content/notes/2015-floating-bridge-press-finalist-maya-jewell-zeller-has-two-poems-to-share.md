Sponsor Floating Bridge Press is back to feature a great work from Maya Jewell Zeller, titled _Yesterday, the Bees_. Zeller's piece was a finalist in the 2015 chapbook competition, a work that looks at parenting, and being a part of a family. 

We have <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">two poems from the work on our sponsors page for you to read</a>. Be sure to look, and click through to their website to find out more about Zeller's work, and the other chapbook winners. Thank you, Floating Bridge for your sponsorship!

If you're a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, [take a look at our open dates](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/).
