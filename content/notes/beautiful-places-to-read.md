Let's be clear that [this post at Web Urbanist](http://weburbanist.com/2015/09/02/room-to-read-in-a-digital-world-14-modern-library-designs/) is a multi-page list, which is a genre of blog post that usually deserves nothing but scorn. But I'll have to give it a pass, because it's about 14 modern library designs and it's the most beautiful thing I've seen on the internet this week. Every single one of these spaces looks like a wonderful place to read; I especially love the Prague National Library, which looks like a giant cartoon amoeba.
