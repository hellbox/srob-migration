In advance of tonight's [#JournalismSoWhite](https://townhallseattle.org/event/journalismsowhite/) event at Town Hall, we wanted to recall our own diversity reports, written by our Public Diversity Editor, Vanessa Willoughby. 

We published [Vanessa's first report on September 7th of this year](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/09/07/public-diversity-editor-report-1-september-2016/). We think her observations and analysis of our work on this issue were right on-point. 

As she pointed out: "Whether it be diverse representation in film or a diverse workplace, sometimes diversity doesn’t necessarily mean equality. A company could mistakenly believe that they’re diverse because they have a few people of color in an otherwise very white staff."

The day after we published her piece, [we responded](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/09/08/our-response-to-the-public-diversity-editor-report-1-september-2016/). Vanessa has agreed to come back at regular intervals and gauge our growth on these important issues.

We call on all publications to take the simple step we did — let an outside auditor evaluate your diversity, so that any tallies or calculations are free of your own internal biases. We'd love to see a media landscape where publications are held to task for the important work of inclusivity.
