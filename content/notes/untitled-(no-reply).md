Oh Wednesday<br>
Full of rain<br>
An argument<br>
With no one

Junk mail<br>
In the mailbox<br>
Hummingbird<br>
In the fall smoke tree

Waiting it out<br>
Coffee going<br>
Cold again<br>
In the untouched

Cup<br>
My father<br>
Not my father<br>
Gone since June

His voice a message<br>
On my phone<br>
Everything<br>
Sounds like rain

In the living room<br>
Of his greeting<br>
When I rewind<br>
Or fast forward

Or gather in stillness<br>
Like smoke<br>
In a hummingbirdâ€™s<br>
Tinfoil throat

Who would listen<br>
Like the rain listens<br>
Tap tap<br>
Like late season

Apples fallen into<br>
The middle of<br>
This week polishing<br>
Their green disbelief
