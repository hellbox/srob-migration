As a rule, I'm against embedding threaded tweets onto a website. Besides the fact that a series of embedded tweets is pretty ugly, there's also the fact that if a so-called news organization posts an entire thread by an author into a blog post, they are publishing an essay and they should pay the writer for their work.

But I recognize that many of you are not on Twitter — good choice, by the way — and you should read this amazing thread by the Seattle Public Library about their recent criminal justice, equity, and inclusion program. (If you are on Twitter — horrible choice, by the way — you should definitely follow [@SPLBuzz](https://twitter.com/SPLBuzz) because they are doing the people's work and they are clearly having a good time while they do it.) Here it is:
