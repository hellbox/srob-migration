Not the rejected lies of the New York Foundling<br>
home, not the adoptive widow of two names,<br>
one of devious spelling,<br>
not the dog tag pinned to the plaid dress<br>
for the train ride to Missouri, but the surname<br>
work like a shoulder brand<br>
on the skin of the natural mother,<br>
Grandmother Grant. 

When I went in my black robes through the hot<br>
streets of the city, a young nun<br>
pale as the star I followed<br>
led to the desk of a three-faced guardian. One<br>
face called me Sister to my face. One was<br>
motherly, "Oh my dear, I can't risk the wrong<br>
information." One, older than the order, nervous,<br>
bit the sentence off<br>
on a fragment of Irish history. 

I couldn't get past the gate. I recognized<br>
the road I was on<br>
led to heaven or hell. Either was barred,<br>
date too early for the name,<br>
a Closed File. I should tell my mother to come.<br>
Back home in Oregon, sixty-nine, wanting to know,<br>
not wanting to know, she waited.<br>
I crossed the continent angry, three thousand<br>
miles of featureless plain. 

Mother, now that you're gone, I'm the same,<br>
swaddled no more in the habit.<br>
Whatever it is that drives us &mdash; bad blood,<br>
the face in the unlighted window,<br>
I'm bound to get it straight. If he knocked her down<br>
in the stinking hold of a ship and raped her,<br>
if she followed him out of the church<br>
into the oldest garden under moonstone limbs<br>
of the sycamore, it's too late<br>
to cover her tracks. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever she was, whatever ties,<br> 
here is my claim. I need to come into my own.
