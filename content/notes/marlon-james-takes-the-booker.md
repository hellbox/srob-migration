Great news! Jamaican novelist Marlon James has won the booker for _A Brief History of Seven Killings_. Everybody I know who has read this book has done nothing but rave about it, and as this linked BBC article says: “The judges had come to a unanimous decision in less than two hours.” 

Congratulations to James. If you’d like to know more about him — and his winning book — Jess Walter and Sherman Alexie recently [talked to him on their podcast _A Tiny Sense of Accomplishment_](http://www.infiniteguest.org/tiny-sense/2015/04/marlon-james-audio-book/).
