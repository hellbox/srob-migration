<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday June 8: *Homegoing* Reading
**</h5></p> 
It’s hard to turn anyone’s head with a dust jacket blurb these days, but the rare appearance of a Ta-Nehisi Coates blurb on Yaa Gyasi’s debut novel *Homegoing* — calling the book an “inspiration” and citing its “so fully realized, so elegantly carved” characters — is a rare meaningful instance. It announces this book as something worth your time. *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday June 9: *Graphic Masters* Opening Night**</h5></p>

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday June 10: *Writers* Opening Night
**</h5></p>
For months now, Seattle artist Christine Marie Larsen has created portraits of local and historical literary figures as a weekly feature here on the *Seattle Review of Books*. Tonight, she’s debuting her first show of author portraits, with three of her subjects — Maged Zaher, Sarah Galvin, and Lesley Hazleton — in attendance. Plus: a Little Free Library! 
*Essentia, 2008 1st Ave, 441-0321, http://pushpullseattle.weebly.com. Free. All ages. 6 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday June 12: Sci-fi Bike Ride**</h5></p>
New-to-Seattle author Adam Rakunas celebrates his new novel about an interplanetary labor union, *Like a Boss*, with a bike ride featuring fellow sci-fi/fantasy authors Laura Anne Gilman and Brenda Cooper. The ride starts at Husky Stadium Station at noon and continues for 2.6 miles to Café Solsticio in Fremont for a 1 pm reading. *Café Solsticio,  1110 N. Northlake Way 547-0404, http://solsticiofremont.com/. Free. All ages. 1 p.m. * 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday June 13: Leveraging Female Political Power
**</h5></p>
It’s clear that women will decide the election this November, either by showing up to vote against Donald Trump or by staying home out of disgust at the electoral process. *Time* magazine reporter Jay Newton-Small will share everything she knows about American women and democracy—from Hillary Clinton’s dealmaking to surprising demographic information—in a talk tonight.
 *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m. * 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday June 14: *Sweet Lamb of Heaven* Reading
**</h5></p>
Lydia Millett’s delightfully creepy novels are full of sticky secrets and missing people and monstrous obsessions. Tonight she’s joined by Seattle’s own Stacey Levine—herself no stranger to bizarre and uncomfortable fictions. This pairing makes so much sense it’s ridiculous; these two writers will either become best friends or they’ll light each other on fire.
