<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_EDGE OF MORNING: Native Voices Speak for the Bears Ears_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/torreyhouse/edge-of-morning-native-voices-speak-for-the-bears). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Torrey House Press](http://torreyhouse.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>How can we protect a sacred landscape without knowing its stories? Help native voices save the Bears Ears with this hardcover book.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	The Bears Ears is a land region of 1.9 million acres in Southern Utah. Ancestral land on the Colorado Plateau. It's the home to amazing history of our lands indigenous peoples, including petroglyph, ancient villages, and other important sites, many of which have been vandalized. Five tribal governments have come together to seek protection for the Bears Ears, and the historical resources it holds. 
</p>

And this anthology seeks to tell stories by native writers about the Bears Ears and its importance. Storytelling is a way of making sure the importance of the land is known, and can help spread awareness for what the coalition is attempting. 

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
It's a worthy project, for one, but be selfish and order it because it's going to be a good book. Hardcover, with introductions, maps, 15 essays and poems about the Bears Ears. Let's show a little love to people using books as a way to spread awareness for something larger themselves, a novel way to get the word out about an important part of the history of this land. Think about how you would have heard about this project 15 years ago, if you did at all? Here's a chance for you to be involved, and watch the project unfold, all while gaining a handsome volume. 

</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	They're 29% funded with 18 days to go, so they need the help. Put your pledge in, and spread the word!
