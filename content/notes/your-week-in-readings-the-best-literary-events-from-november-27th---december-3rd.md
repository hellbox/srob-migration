<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday, November 27th:  *Obama: an Intimate Portrait* Reading**</h5></p>
Pete Souza was President Barack Obama’s official photographer, and the photos that he’s captured in that role have defined America’s relationship to Obama. These are photos that will last forever, long after the horrendous current political moment has passed. And Souza has been trolling Donald Trump quite effectively on social media in the last few months by posting photographic proof of Obama’s competence whenever Trump messes something up. It’s a cathartic, moving experience.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday, November 28th: Loud Mouth Lit with Lindy West**</h5></p>
Playwright and memoirist Paul Mullin's reading series continues a string of knockout lineups with the indomitable Lindy West. Mullin will be reading a chapter from an upcoming novel. West will be reading, and I quote from the press release, "whatever she goddamn pleases." (But seriously: West's working on her second book, so you might just get a special preview if you come out tonight.)

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday, November 29th: *The Sentient Machine* Reading  **</h5></p>
Amir Husain’s first book has the oh-so-humble name of *The Sentient Machine: The Coming Age of Artificial Intelligence*. Is it true that AI will be the death of us all? Is it possible that the AI revolution that so many have predicted simply…won’t happen? What the hell should we do about it? Husain will provide the answers tonight.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday, December 2nd:  Healing Histories**</h5></p>
*Everfair* novelist, much-anthologized short story author, and *Seattle Review of Books* columnist Nisi Shawl teaches a free writing class in the Green Lake branch of the Seattle Public Library. What the hell could you possibly have to lose? For the low, low price of free, Shawl will almost certainly leave you a better author than you were when you walked into the room.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday, December 3rd:  Seattle's Cold Moon: A Reading of Poetry and Rituals**</h5></p>

Location details to be announced. Reader list to be announced. The event will be free and open to the public, so please share widely.</blockquote>
