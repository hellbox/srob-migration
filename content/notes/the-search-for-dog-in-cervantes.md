You may recall that <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/ivan-schneider/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Ivan Schneider">Ivan Schneider</a> &mdash; frequent contributor and friend of the _Seattle Review of Books_ &mdash; in his <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/06/05/talking-to-ourselves/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Talking to ourselves">interview with David Shields</a>, talked about his delicious outsider theory on how Cervantes intended _Don Quixote_ to have a talking dog character. 

Schneider turned that theory into an academic paper titled "The Search for Dog in Cervantes", which was just published in the peer-reviewed _Humanties_ journal, in their special "Animal Narratology" issue. <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/6/3/49/htm" title="Humanities  | Free Full-Text | The Search for Dog in Cervantes | HTML">You can read the whole thing online</a>. 

This Tuesday, August 15th, Ivan is hosting a private event at Mercer Street Books to celebrate the publication. If you would like to attend this memorable event, <a href="mailto:ivan@ivantohelpyou.com">contact Ivan</a> for an invitation. It sounds like it will be one for the ages.
