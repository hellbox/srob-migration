This week, the _Seattle Review of Books_ is sponsored by Lois Farfel Stark — the award-winning filmmaker behind more than forty documentaries and, now, the author of _The Telling Image_. Stark's new book is an exploration of how humans experience the world through shape: a web, a ladder, a helix. Her vast experience makes a tour de force out of what could easily have been a quiet coffee table book.

We look at the world in a sleepy way, especially through the lens of social media, where images slide past in a blur. Stark's book is like caffeine for the visual center of your brain. Stop by [our sponsorship page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) for a glimpse at the rich images she's captured while traveling the world, and her take on them. Then go for a long walk. Keep your eyes open. See what you see.

Sponsors like Lois Farfel Stark make the *Seattle Review of Books* possible. Did you know [you could sponsor us, as well](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/)?
