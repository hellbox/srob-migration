* Don't forget that the deadline to apply for a table at this year's Short Run Comix & Arts Festival is July 31st. The organizers this year are eager to include the literary arts, so even if you're "just" a writer and not an artist or cartoonist, [you should consider applying](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeks10GN1fuW7fcBGEDbVhqMSJoaesD1CCjlkaaASn3poBLeA/viewform?c=0&w=1).

* This is a pretty big get: the [King County Library System Foundation announced yesterday](http://mailchi.mp/kclsfoundation/announcing?e=f1d9c375e6) that basketball great and all-around awesome human Kareem Abdul-Jabbar will be the headliner at their 2018 Literary Lions fundraising dinner. This year's headliner, for comparison's sake, was Daniel Handler. Handler gave a spectacular speech and he's definitely a high-profile author, but Abdul-Jabbar is a household name. Expect tickets to go very fast for this one. The Literary Lions dinner will take place in Bellevue on Saturday, March 10th of next year. We'll let you know when tickets go on sale.

* At the *Seattle Times*, SPL librarian David Wright [wrote a great profile of local publisher Pharos Editions](http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/local-publisher-revives-lost-northwest-classics/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=article_title_1.1), which has brought some essential Northwest literary classics back from the dead.

* While we're talking about local reviews, Seattle Mystery Bookshop bookseller Fran [published a good review of Cory Doctorow's latest novel](http://seattlemysteryblog.typepad.com/seattle_mystery/2017/07/walkaway.html), *Walkaway*.

* [Tara Marie at the Polygon has written](https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/18/15960690/howard-chaykin-divided-states-of-hysteria-image-comic) a good meditation on white cisgender privilege in the comics industry, using Howard Chaykin's atrocious *Divided States of Hysteria* as the launching pad for the piece. (I read the first issue of the series and decided to ignore it; Chaykin has a long history, with his best work decades behind him, and he's now become nothing more than an aggrieved-white-dude comics troll like Frank Miller. I'm happy to not give Chaykin the attention, but I'm glad that writers like Marie are around to explain what it all means to general audiences.)

* The new Jane Austen pound notes have a quote from *Pride and Prejudice* — "I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!” — that was...how shall we say...[not quite delivered earnestly in the novel](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-jane-austen-pound-note-features-egregiously-misused-quote_us_596e366de4b0b95f893e66a5?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004):

<blockquote>As many Janeites were quick to point out, that quote wasn’t sincere. Caroline Bingley, the haughty gentlewoman who competes with Elizabeth Bennet for Mr. Darcy’s attentions, makes this announcement in hopes of impressing him. “How much sooner one tires of anything than a book!” Miss Bingley adds. Shortly after saying so, already bored by a quick dip into a book, she throws it aside and tries another gambit to grab his attention. In short, Austen wrote the line as a satirical comment on how we perform certain admirable qualities to win approval.</blockquote>

* I don't really believe in guilty-pleasure reading. Every book has some value, even if it proves that value through negative means. But people like interactive lists on the internet, so maybe you might enjoy this checklist of "[Books You'll Never Brag About Having Read](http://www.listchallenges.com/books-youll-never-brag-about-having-read)." Don't listen to the headline; feel free to brag if you want to. Try to beat my score:

<p class="image">![](/webhook-uploads/1500413201029/brag-brag-brag.png)</p>

* I prefer to leave the writing prompts to Martin, since [he does them so well on this site every Saturday](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/07/15/seattle-writing-prompts-the-dystopian-emotionalist-future-of-our-ruined-commie-red-city/), but this tweet is too good a writing prompt to ignore:

* After you've watched *Wonder Woman* for the 16th time this fall, you might want to take a break by watching the biopic about the creator of Wonder Woman, titled *Professor Marston & the Wonder Women*. The trailer was just released yesterday:
