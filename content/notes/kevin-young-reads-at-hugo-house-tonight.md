I just want to call your attention to what should be a magnificent book event tonight. Poet Kevin Young is [giving a craft talk at the Hugo House](https://hugohouse.org/event/kevin-young-on-throwing-your-voice/) starting at 7 pm. Young is one of the very best American poets; his last collection, *Book of Hours*, destroyed me with its raw depiction of grief. It's one of the best collections I've read in recent memory. (You can [read my review here](https://medium.com/@paulconstant/a-total-loss-f46831d8dece#.khy2ukre5).) In addition, Young is being interviewed by Jane Wong, the excellent local poet whose [work has appeared](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/03/29/apology-in-the-age-of-construction/) on the *Seattle Review of Books* on [more than one occasion](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/13/spoiled/). This should be a night to remember.
