I'm taking part in a couple of upcoming readings at Benaroya Hall that you might want to consider attending. 

<p class="image">![](/webhook-uploads/1507334947348/maupin.jpg)</p>

Next Monday, I'm appearing in conversation with beloved novelist Armistead Maupin. He'll be in Seattle to debut his brand-new memoir, *Logical Family*, which charts Maupin's path from a young conservative kid growing up in the South to a beloved newspaper columnist and gay rights activist to the novelist who created the astonishing *Tales of the City* series. Maupin's career path is a wild one, and he's telling his own story for the very first time. [Tickets for that reading are available here](https://cart.seattlesymphony.org/single/SYOS.aspx?p=19556).

And then on Sunday, November 19th, I'll be introducing David Sedaris as he makes his annual swing through town. You probably don't need me to tell you that Sedaris is one of the very finest readers in the world. I've attended his Seattle readings for almost twenty years now — from back when he used to fill up the downstairs reading room at Elliott Bay Book Company's Pioneer Square location — and I've never seen him give a bad show. He's always funny and smart and very, very entertaining. [Tickets for that are available now](https://cart.seattlesymphony.org/single/SYOS.aspx?p=19548). You won't regret attending this reading.
