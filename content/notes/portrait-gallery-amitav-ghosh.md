<p class="intro">Each week, [Christine Larsen](http://christinelarsen.com) creates a portrait of a new author for us. Have any favorites you’d love to see immortalized? [Let us know](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about)</p>

I’ve seen Ghosh speak on his previous trips to Seattle. He’s a funny, dynamic, and fascinating storyteller. Be sure not to [miss him tomorrow at Town Hall](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/05/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-october-5-to-october-11/).
