<p class="prose-poem">Police Chief Kathleen O’Toole says,<br>
“My hope is this will be the community’s police station”</p>

<p class="prose-poem">and every inch of black girl resistance in me becomes a tremor becomes palpitation of heart and earth,<br>
a bullet in barrel,<br>
Earth’s crust eager to rift itself into a beast that breathes fire.</p>

<p class="prose-poem">Experts say,<br>
a .9 earthquake will hit Seattle within the century.<br>
Police union says it needs a new facility able to endure eventual catastrophe and I think<br><br>
if cops need building material,<br>
there’s nothing more able to endure fission than a black or brown body.</p>

<p class="prose-poem">There’s nothing that holds up guilt, greed, and excess more than a back that is used to being broken,<br>
but I’m glad<br>
I get a seat at a table I’ve set<br>
A community space a floor above a shooting range:<br>
a court to practice the de-escalation technique of killing people who look like my family Thank you, officer, for this concession.</p>

<p class="prose-poem">Capital will never become full enough to not steal the fruits of our labor. Will never sacrifice beyond what it can get away with spitting up. Capital<br>
harvests stolen crop<br>
until mouth twists into gallant smile, blood on leaves and blood at root Strange<br>
Fruit</p>

<p class="prose-poem">O’Toole wants the new precinct host a farmers market.<br>
What can grow in a fortress besides a pedestal to hang a noose? What good is a community that bonds over lynching?<br>
Is this what a safe city looks like?<br>
Is this<br>
Emerald City progressive showing us the man behind the curtain and expecting us to pay no mind?</p>

<p class="prose-poem">Government ain't the wizard we hoped<br>
but a coward pretending to be better than he is<br>
Is this the fraud I'm expected to call progressive?<br>
Is this the shooting range I am expected to call my community?<br>
Tell me,<br>
O’Toole<br>
What's a new precinct to Oscar Perez’s grieving family?<br>
What's a new bunker to the 10,000 homeless people in Seattle besides another place they can't live in?<br>
This is excessive force<br>
of the most insidious kind</p>

<p class="prose-poem">I don't know which will hurt me first:<br>
a building collapse or a cop mistaking my mother’s body for a weapon Either way<br>
I know whose lives matter in this city<br>
and it's not black lives.<br>
Seattle is prepared for us to die<br>
Seattle making a refuge for people who already get away with killing us, too.</p>

<p class="prose-poem">Insurrection will be the next major disaster this city faces<br>
Will resurface all the lies and empty promises it was told<br>
Pulse from the streets up, radiate the heat of magma Molotov and bitter history, no longer latent and cowering,<br>
but surging, dangerous, and revolutionary.</p>

<p class="prose-poem">We will be hammer to the coffin of every cruel and fragile thing that has wronged us and tool to every dream we want to build in its place<br>
A table where capitalism is not welcome<br>
A city my mother can feel safe in<br>
A city where all lives actually matter<br>
Where hands reach out to hold mine instead of to the gun in its holster</p>

<p class="prose-poem">I know<br>
it's hard to stay hopeful<br>
in times where death seems to lurk around every corner But we are unstoppable<br>
and another world is growing within us<br>
I am prepared to fight<br>
for a community<br>
That is real</p>

<p class="poem-footer">Azura Tyabji is our February Poet in Residence.<br><br>
