We're taking the day off to enjoy our loved ones, and we hope you'll do the same. Tomorrow we begin a new year in earnest, with several fun new features and more on the way. But today, if you're looking for something to do, stop by Comics Dungeon in Wallingford for their [annual year-end (and year-beginning) sale](https://www.facebook.com/events/348658922175339/). Take it from me: there is no joy as pure as digging through a box of $1 comics and finding $20 worth of cultural artifacts to plow through on a cold winter afternoon.
