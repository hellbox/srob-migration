**Podcast #1**: [The Art of Commerce](http://www.0s-1s.com/the-art-of-commerce-xxxiii) talked with Third Place Books managing partner Robert Sindelar about the pleasures and problems of running a bookstore. (If you're wondering, the Seward Park Third Place Books is still scheduled to open early in 2016.)

**Podcast #2** I talked with Brad Craft and Nick DiMartino for [the 50th episode of their delightful Breakfast at the Bookstore podcast](https://soundcloud.com/ubookstore/breakfast-at-the-bookstore-50). We discussed the importance of criticism, what we've been reading lately, and why Martin McClellan and I started the *Seattle Review of Books*.
