Here's a *SRoB* conflict of interest that might be of interest to you: *Seattle Review of Books* columnist [Aaron Bagley](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/aaron-bagley/) is debuting a new kid's book he created with his wife Jessixa Bagley in two weeks at the wondrous Secret Garden Bookshop in Ballard, and you're invited!

*Vincent Comes Home* is the story of a cat who lives on a freighter. When the freighter comes to port and its sailors all return to their homes, Vincent wonders if he has a home of his own. Aaron and Jessixa created the watercolor art for the book together and it's gorgeous.

The party is on [Sunday, February 18th at 4 pm](http://www.secretgardenbooks.com/event/jessixa-bagley-aaron-bagley-vincent-comes-home). Jessixa and Aaron will be there. And it's free!
