Our sponsor [Priscilla Long](http://www.priscillalong.com "Home - Priscilla Long") is launching her new poetry collection _Crossing Over_ September 19th at 7pm at Elliott Bay Books. For the next day, we're featuring one of her poems on our [sponsrship page](/sponsorships), and we hope you take a look. 

Like all of our sponsors, Priscilla is a hard-working writer. She wants to get the word out about her upcoming event. Take a look, consider going to see her, and tell her you found out about the reading on the _SRoB_. Your consideration is the first step in our campaign to make advertising on the [internet something we all like](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/ "The Seattle Review of Books - Help us make internet advertisements 100 percent less terrible").
