<p class="noindent">
Friday November 18th: 
<br />As <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/after-the-end-of-the-world/">Sarah Galvin noted in her excellent review</a>, **Michelle Tea** is an iconic memoirist and queer sex symbol. Her newest book, *Black Wave*, is a memoir with a dystopic novel laid over the top, which kind of resembles the world in which we live right now. Tea is joined by memoirist Donna Kaz and musician Jordan O’Jordan. <br />
<br />*Fred Wildlife Refuge, 128 Belmont Ave. E., 322-7030.<br /> http://www.hugohouse.org. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*</p>
