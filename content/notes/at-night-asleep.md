She comes into our room again,<br>
her first time in weeks.<br>
I hear a small stir on the floor,<br>
the rustle of crumpled paper or a bag.<br>
Last month I would have covered my head<br>
at this noise, groaned in irritation,<br>
but not so today. I lie quiet in hopes<br>
that she complete her first return. 

On the phone last night, a surprise,<br>
my mom said, Your dad<br>
and I divorced when you were ten.<br>
For two or three years, you didn’t have stable<br> 
parents. I was caught up in my head<br>
and couldn’t really be there for you.<br>
Her years-old absence, precise, pristine, still stings me,<br> 
though I feel some shame that it does &mdash;

it’s like being a child again,<br>
though I am all grown.<br>
An aching need for my mother<br> 
originated decades ago, landed,<br> 
dug a hole, and took root. She was gone.<br>
Sadness grew then, sprouted up and bloomed,<br>
blue and dark, with petals that peeled easily<br> 
from the slight stems when I touched them.

This was all I knew of growing,<br>
so I tended it<br>
and cultivated a garden<br>
of these flowers, navy-dark, gray-rimmed, the kind<br> 
of night in which no stars can be seen<br> 
by the eye that searches up for them.<br>
I mistook the sadness for beauty. It was.<br>
I mourned each blue petal that fell.

That was a thing, my mother said.<br>
It’s not surprising <br>
that loving causes you worry.<br>
Sometimes sadness seemed the heart of love. Tonight,<br>
though, I lie in wait for her, the cat.<br>
I’m hopeful she’ll come back. With her here,<br>
I’ve learned some joy, how to honor another’s<br>
right to be. So too with my Boo,

sound asleep, snoring, not worried<br>
when, or if, she will<br>
return. He settles in his sleep<br> 
against my body, his warm skin on my skin,<br>
solid and soft, a quiet promise<br>
that some loves are here to stay. They will.<br>
A small rustle, just a thread, and she jumps<br>
from the wooden floor to the bed.
