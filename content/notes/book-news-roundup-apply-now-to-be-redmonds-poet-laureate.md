* Applications for the next Redmond Poet Laureate are [due on December 15th](http://redmond.gov/cms/One.aspx?portalId=169&pageId=201458). The selected poet will get $5,000 per year in artist fees and $5,000 per year in project materials.

* [These maps Kathy Acker drew of her own dreams](http://lithub.com/see-the-detailed-diagrams-kathy-acker-drew-of-her-dreams/) are simply gorgeous.

* The quest to create the ebook version of marginalia has yet to truly break new ground. [Liza Daly](https://medium.com/@liza/interactive-marginalia-f39424877d73) has some thoughts on that.

* Some [reflections from Amazon staffers as the Kindle turns ten](https://publishingperspectives.com/2017/11/amazon-kindle-turns-10-david-naggar-interview/). The claim that Kindle â€œreally was about the content" makes me shudder. Books are not content. Content is meaningless chaff you shove into the blank spaces of a website. Books are books. Please make a note of it.
