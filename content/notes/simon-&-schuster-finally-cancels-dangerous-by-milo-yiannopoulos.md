So it turns out that Simon & Schuster's "free speech" defense of Yiannopoulos was total bullshit. When people complained about Yiannopoulos's racism and sexim, Simon & Schuster was high on the free speech horse. But now that video has emerged of Yiannopoulos exercising his free speech about pedophilia, Simon & Schuster runs away. 

In other words, it was only when Yiannopoulos started spouting **unmarketable speech** that Simon & Schuster got queasy. **This was never about free speech. This was always about money.**
