<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday November 10th: *Now for the Disappointing Part* Book Launch**</h5></p> 
Seattle writer Steven Barker made a big splash in 2013 with a GeekWire piece titled “An open letter to Jeff Bezos: A contract worker’s take on Amazon.com.” Tonight, he launches a whole book about life in the contract-work economy, subtitled *A Pseudo-Adult’s Decade of Short-Term Jobs, Long-Term Relationships, and Holding Out for Something Better*.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Alternate Friday November 11th: Red Badge Project's Women Veteran Reading**</h5></p> 
Because the *Seattle Review of Books* is co-producing the previous event at Elliott Bay Book Company, we'd like to provide an alternate, conflict-of-interest-free event for you to consider. And this looks like a great cause: Seattle authors Suzanne Morrison and Sonya Lea present a reading from their Red Badge Project, which invites an audience "to hear the stories of women veterans in this remarkable evening to honor their service, on Veteran's Day."
*Frye Art Museum, 704 Terry Ave., http://https://www.facebook.com/events/1808684429377526/, 7 p.m., all ages, free.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday November 12th: *Hola and Goodbye* Book Launch Party**</h5></p> 
 Seattle author Donna Miscolta launches her new collection of short stories, which charts the progress of a Latinx family across three generations. In a time when the Republican Party is trying as hard as they can to demonize immigrants, this book celebrates the immigrant experience. This publication party features music from Acustico Perfecto.
*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*


<h5>**Sunday November 13th: Book Launch Times Two**</h5></p> 
It’s a week to launch books into the world, apparently. This evening, Open Books is host to two book launches at once: Ellen Welcker presents her newest poetry collection *Ram Hands* and Tim Greenup’s new book of poetry is titled *Without Warning*. Greenup writes poetry about corn mazes and wild animals. Welcker writes poems about babies and “butt holders.”
*Open Books, 2414 N. 45th St., 633-0811, openpoetrybooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m.* 


<h5>**Monday November 14th: *Mapping the Heavens* Reading**</h5></p> 
Priyamvada Natarajans is an astrophysicist. Her new book aims to make sense out of the mysteries of the cosmos. *Mapping the Heavens* explains dark matter, black holes, and the expansion of the universe. If it helps, think of it as astrology, only it’s actually based in facts and it can’t help predict if you’re getting laid this weekend.
*Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m.*


<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday November 15th: *Future Sex* Reading**</h5></p>
Emily Witt’s new book examines modern sexuality, from online dating to changing opinions about polyamory. Future Sex is part memoir, part investigative journalism, part profile of sexual subcultures. And all together, those different narrative threads combine to form a portrait of what it means to be a sexual woman in the 21st century.
 *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m.*
