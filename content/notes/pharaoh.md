In the saltwater aquarium at the pain clinic<br>
lives a yellow tang<br>
who chews the minutes in its cheeks<br>
while we await our unguents and anesthesias. 

The big gods offer us this little god<br>
before the turning of the locks<br>
in their Formica cabinets<br>
in the rooms of our interrogation.

We have otherwise been offered magazines<br>
with movie stars whose shininess<br>
diminishes as the pages lose<br>
their crispness as they turn. 

But the fish is undiminishing, its face<br>
like the death mask of a pharaoh,<br>
which remains while the mortal face<br>
gets disassembled by the microbes of the tomb.

And because our pain is ancient,<br>
we too will formalize our rituals with blood<br>
leaking out around the needle<br>
when the big gods try but fail

to find the bandit vein. It shrivels when pricked,<br>
and they'll say _I've lost it_<br>
and prick and prick until the trouble's brought<br>
to the pale side of the other elbow

from which I turn my head away &mdash;<br>
but Pharaoh you do not turn away.<br>
You watch us hump past with our walkers<br>
with the tennis balls on their hind legs,

your sideways black eye on our going<br>
down the corridor to be caressed<br>
by the hand with the knife and the hand with the balm<br>
when we are called out by our names.
