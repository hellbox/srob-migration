We get asked this a lot, and it is the nicest, most heartening compliment we can think of. We are not a non-profit, so we don't ask for your money. We're not interested in a Patreon or GoFundMe page. In fact, the best way for you to support us to be slightly selfish and take a bit of time for yourself each week. How?

Well, did you know that our sponsorships are not generic, horrible internet advertising? Do you know that preparing and presenting each sponsorship is an hours-long, hand-crafted process to create the very best reading experience possible for you? That the people who buy our sponsorships feel like you're really going to like what they have to say, and that you may like it so much that you'll want to buy their book, or attend their reading?

<p class="pull-quote">All we ask is that you take a few minutes each week to look at our sponsorships.</p>

We do have to say it pretty often, because we're all so used to advertising on the internet being so terrible. But: _All we ask is that you take a few minutes each week to look at our sponsorship_. Read the sample chapter and see if it's something that appeals to you. That's it! If you like it, of course we invite you to pick up a copy of the book, or attend the event. But really, all we ask, as your way of supporting us, is for you to look each week. If you've done that, you are actively supporting us in very real way. 

If you're more motivated, then if you're ever talking to a friend and they say something like "_Wow, did you see that Elisa Chavez poem on the Seattle Review of Books? I love that they run poems like that._", you should reply: "_Did you visit their sponsor's page? Do it every week. It paid for Elisa's poem to appear on the site._"

Not to lay it on too thick, but it literally is true: your attention and time is all the support we desire, and it would mean so much to us if you could help us out in this way.

***But what if I _really_ want to send you money?***

<p class="noindent">We seriously get asked this. We're not making it up. And, finally, we have an answer: _you, too, can buy a sponsorship_! 

We'll give you a discount over our published rate, and you can tell us about a book you want people to know about. As long as you have no financial interest or connection to the author, we'll take your thoughts and write up a nice blurb, and get that book in front of our readers for a full week. You'll have given us some money, and directly paid for the content you see every day on the site.</p>

And of course, if you have your own book or event to promote, our sponsorships are as popular as ever. <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">Take a look at the newly released block of dates</a>, and let us help you tell your story. We can't wait.
