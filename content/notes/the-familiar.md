I’ve memorized the dark of my room now,<br>
the path between the door and the bed posts<br>
that lash out and mark my pale shins,<br>
memorized the width of the rivulet I make<br>
between our two sleep bodies by rolling<br>
just slightly away.<br>
He told me his kink was “morning sex.”<br>
Indeed, I feel extra naughty<br>
at approximately 6:36 a.m.,<br>
get off on licking the sleep<br>
from your eyes. I reach my peak<br>
when over pancakes I get a glimpse of the deflated<br>
anniversary balloon in the diner shellacked<br>
to the curtains and hanging sad.<br>
In my dream last night I lived with my parents<br>
and we were skipping town. Their faces a<br>
mishmash blur, they told me I’d have my own<br>
room; a window seat, a walk-in closet.<br>
We arrived in the evening. My dream self<br>
paced through the room, which became a set of<br>
stairs, which became a zigzagging blue<br>
slide into a dirt hole. No the slide is<br>
a yellow water slide in Texas and cherry blood<br>
spills from my toe. No my toe is my future<br>
child’s toe that I bandage. No my child<br>
is a portable first-aid kit no my child<br>
is a pixelated projection on a weird white wall<br>
no I will not just spend my life as<br>
the tender of this tin of bandaids!<br>
You shouldn’t end anything<br>
with your character waking from a dream.<br>
But I can’t get out of this room<br>
without at least one eye cracked.
