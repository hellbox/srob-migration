This morning, Gawker.com — the popular news site that started as a publishing industry gossip blog — confirmed rumors that it will [shut down next week](http://gawker.com/gawker-com-to-end-operations-next-week-1785455712). This would be a great time to read Brian Abrams's ebook *Gawker: An Oral History*, which was published last summer. I [reviewed that book when it was released last year](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/who-gawks-at-the-gawkers/).
