<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Denise Levertov Plaque_](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/denise-levertov-plaque-poetry). We've put $60 in as a non-reward backer &mdash; that's our normal $20, plus $40 from the fund for the two unsuccessful projects we've backed that we decided to put towards this campaign.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Paul E Nelson / SPLAB](http://splab.org).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
A plaque to be installed outside of Levertov's last home, in Seattle's Seward Park neighborhood.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	We're fans of Levertov, here at the _Seattle Review of Books_. Our co-founder, Paul Constant, wrote a <a href="http://lithub.com/denise-levertov/" title="Denise Levertov Should Be More Famous | Literary  Hub">dedicated plea for her to be better recognized last year in LitHub</a>. We love the idea of a plaque, one of those urban markers that cement the past to the present. We love the idea of the city bearing a tattoo of her presence, and the idea that it may lead a few curious bypassers to investigate her name, and discover her work.
</p>


<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	Because you're a Levertov fan who feels that her work is under appreciated. Because you like the idea of the history of a place informing and shaping it. Because you're a booster and fan of local poetry, and marking something like this, albeit a small gesture in the grand civic scheme, puts a thumb-print on the city that says: this work was important to us; this woman was important to us. Let's take a moment to recall her.
	</p>


<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	52% there, with five days to go. We'd love to see this worthy project backed. If you can afford to, please get involved.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
