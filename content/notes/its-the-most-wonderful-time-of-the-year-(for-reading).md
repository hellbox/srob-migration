This ["Introvert" Christmas ornament](http://mcphee.com/shop/introvert-ornament.html#Details) from Archie McPhee, featuring a bespectacled reader hiding behind a book, seems like the sort of thing that readers of this site might enjoy. (They're not a bookstore, but the *Seattle Review of Books* still loves the ever-loving hell out of Archie McPhee.)
