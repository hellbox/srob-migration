Mary Ann Gwinn at the *Seattle Times* pays tribute to the Washington Center for the Book's executive director, Chris Higashi. In her time at the Center and in conjuinction with the Seattle Public Library, Higashi has done more for reading and literature in this city than just about anyone. Now she's retiring. [It's a lovely piece and you should read it](http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/saying-farewell-to-one-of-the-founding-mothers-of-our-city-of-literature/). 

Whoever takes Higashi's position will be facing down a tremendous responsibility: leadership at the Seattle Public Library has [not demonstrated a commitment to books and readings](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/26/an-open-letter-to-the-seattle-public-library-board-of-trustees-about-spls-anti-book-agenda/). Higashi has been a tremendous champion for the importance of connecting authors and Seattleites, and that is a charge which must be kept alive.
