The Seattle Poetics LAB notes that the new plaque honoring poet Denise Levertov, which [Martin told you about a couple months ago](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/10/01/denise-levertov-plaque-kickstarter-fund-project-37/), has been installed at **5535 Seward Park Ave S**. [Learn more about Levertov here](http://lithub.com/denise-levertov/), and visit the plaque next time you're in south Seattle.
