See our Literary Event of the Week column for more details.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday December 15th: *Hola and Goodbye* Reading**</h5></p> 
Seattle author Donna Miscolta’s new book of linked short stories, *Hola and Goodbye* follows multiple generations of women in a Latinx family as they come to America and forge new paths for themselves, facing tremendous sexism, racism, and economic barriers. This is a heartfelt American story that was published at exactly the right time.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday December 17th: Holiday Story Time**</h5></p> 
Elliott Bay Book Company traditionally hosts kids’ readings on Saturday mornings. (They’ve been much better-attended since the store moved from Pioneer Square to Capitol Hill.) The final edition of the year is a special holiday-themed reading for kids read by “a local Seattle actor.”

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday December 20th: *How the Grinch Stole Christmas* Reading**</h5></p>
*How the Grinch Stole Christmas* is a holiday classic that even managed to survive the apocalyptic threat of that Jim Carrey-starring abomination that Hollywood shat up a while back. Today, University Book Store hosts a reading of Dr. Seuss’s Christmas classic for young audiences. Take part in the tradition. *University Book Store,  4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/. Free. All ages. 11 a.m. *
