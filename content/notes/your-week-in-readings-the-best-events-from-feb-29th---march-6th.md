**MONDAY** Your week starts at [Town Hall](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=02&evyear=2016&eventid=2015121110254900&pre=20160221&pst=20160229) with science journalist **Sonia Shah**. Her new book *Pandemic* examines the possibility of infectious disease destroying human civilization by examining the many times cholera has broken out over the last two centuries. Cholera has killed hundreds of millions of human beings. Which, you know, is depressing. But important!

**TUESDAY**  We’re starting this day off by pointing out that Timothy Egan debuts his new book, *Meagher, From Irish Immigrant to Hero*, [at Town Hall](https://townhallseattle.org/event/timothy-egan-2/). Egan is one of Seattle’s heavyweights, and this is sure to be a huge reading. But we also like the smaller events, and Hugo House’s second [Ask the Oracle](https://www.facebook.com/events/172118549825910/) reading at the Sorrento Hotel sounds like a very fun time. Three authors read works in response to audience questions, and the whole event is disguised as a fortune-telling experience. Today’s readers are New York poet **Roberto Ascalon**, Seattle novelist **Megan Kruse** (author of the [excellent *Call Me Home*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/tolstoys-unhappy-family-moves-to-the-northwest/)), and Seattle poet **Imani Sims**. Honestly, you could go to either of these events and have a lot of fun.

**WEDNESDAY** Up in [Third Place Books Lake Forest Park](http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/kathryn-aalto-natural-world-winnie-pooh-walk-through-forest-inspired-hundred-acre-wood)  **Kathryn Aalto** reads from her book *The Natural World of Winnie-the-Pooh*, which examines the story behind A.A. Milne’s childrens’ books through drawings, photographs, and biographical details. If you’re into behind-the-scenes material, you’ll love this one.

**THURSDAY** [Elliott Bay Book Company](https://www.facebook.com/events/1741557519409192/)  hosts Sri Lankan author **Nayomi Munaweera**, whose new novel *What Lies Between Us* explores “the bonds between women, the lifelong impact of trauma, and feminism's last taboo.” 

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1456533731837/bloodmemory.jpg)</p>**FRIDAY** It’s back to [Elliott Bay Book Company](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/colleen-j-mcelroy) with you for professor emeritus at the University of Washington **Colleen J. McElroy**, who will read from her newest book of poems, *Blood Memory*. McElroy really ought to get more credit as a towering figure in Seattle poetry; she’s been an involved member of the community for decades, and her poetry might just [knock your (metaphorical) socks off](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/237220).

**SATURDAY** The third [Rainier Valley Lit Crawl](https://www.facebook.com/events/230258920644420/) happens tonight, rain or shine. Tonight’s Crawl runs from Spinnaker Bay Brewing to Big Chickie to The Collaboratory to Union Bar, and it features writers including **Paul E. LaPier, Kathryn Burgomaster, [EJ Koh](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/06/korean-war/), Philip Randolph, Faiza Sultan, Becca HallJed Myers, and Mary Crane**. I bet you’ve never attended a poetry reading in a Peruvian-style chicken restaurant, have you? Tonight’s your big chance. It’s free. What do yo uhave to lose?

**SUNDAY** As with most of our weeks recently, our week ends tonight at The Monorail Reading Series at [Fred Wildlife Refuge](https://www.facebook.com/events/1670245093227275/). Tonight’s poets are all reportedly pioneers in one way or another, including new-to-Seattle poet **Michael Harper**, Portland author and Octopus Books assistant editor **Hajara Quinn**, and Copper Canyon poet **Natalie Shapero**.  Pioneering or not, this seems like a stellar lineup of local and visiting poets. Plus: booze! What’s not to love?
