Heyyyyyyy! [An actually useful piece of information has been added to Google searches](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/09/18/local-librarys-ebooks-now-appear-google-search/): now when you look up books, Google will include links to ebook listings at local libraries. Just look all the way at the bottom of the card that comes up when you Google a book title and you'll find it there. I can't remember the last time Google made a change that actively improved my life with no serious setbacks, so this is a welcome development.
