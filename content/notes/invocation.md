<p class="intro">_And God said "&hellip; I'm lonely_<br>
_I'll make me a world."_<br>
â€” James Weldon Johnson<br>
"The Creation"</p>

Tell us your stories<br>
August Wilson

Remind us<br>
of the voices you hear<br>
Boy Willie<br>
Ma Rainey<br>
Aunt Esther's children

Bring forth for us<br>
the visions you hear<br>
King Hedley<br>
Fences<br>
Two Trains Running

Conjure up for us<br>
Langston's words<br>
"Life for me ain't been<br>
no crystal stair, but<br>
I's climbin"

August Wilson<br>
keep dippin' your fingers<br>
in the waters<br>
Tell Freedom<br>
We'z ready<br>
Take our love<br>
with you<br>
Take our love

_for Constanza_<br>
_&amp; all of us_
