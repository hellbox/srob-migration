I have [written before](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/08/24/thursday-comics-hangover-dumbforgiven/) about how much I detest Mark Millar's *Old Man Logan* story. It's the worst of modern superhero comics: cynical, try-hard, a crass rip-off of a significant pop cultural icon (Millar should have to pay royalty checks to Clint Eastwood for what he did to *Unforgiven*.) Somehow the series, which imagined Wolverine living in a dystopian future in which the Hulk breeds with his cousin to father a posse of inbred hulkbillies, managed to inspire Hugh Jackman's final Wolverine movie, *Logan* - a film with all the heart and thoughtfulness that the original series lacked. But that's the only good thing to ever come out of *Old Man Logan*

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1522908229867/oldwomanlaura.jpg)</p>

Until now. The 33rd issue of *All-New Wolverine*, which follows the adventures of Wolverine's younger female clone Laura, kicks off a new storyline called *Old Woman Laura*. Written by Tom Taylor and illustrated by Ramon Rosanas, this series seems to be a direct response to *Old Man Logan* - a critique and a call to better superheroic storytelling.

I haven't read a single issue of *All-New Wolverine* before this one, but I could still easily follow the action. Laura - a character that almost everyone knows, thanks to Dafne Keen's heartfelt portrayal in *Logan* - is a national leader in a utopian future. She's mentoring an even-younger clone of herself, Gabby, who has taken on the Wolverine name for herself. (This is not the ugly, grim Wolverine of the 1990s: Gabby makes her grand entrance in the comic by groaning at the bad guys, "Urgh, you're the worst.") Laura learns that her time on Earth might be numbered, so she decides to fix the two biggest mistakes from her past: give one person a second chance, and kill another person who escaped justice.

Where *Old Man Logan* was nasty and mean, *Old Woman Laura* is fun and compassionate. "We fought against greed and hate and fear. And we actually made the world a better place. The heroes won," Laura announces in the first few pages. It's accompanied by a cityscape drawn by Rosanas that shows glimmering towers and huge expanses of vegetation, all in lush shades of green. It's a beautiful world - one that laughs in the face of *Old Man Logan*'s loathsome dustbowl.

Of course, things could go wrong between this first issue and the end of the *Old Woman Laura* storyline, but Laura's quote above seems to be the mission statement for the book, a refutation of the cynical worldview espoused by Millar in *Old Man Logan*. Millar argued that even if heroes did their best, they'd still lose because the natural order of things is to decay and turn sour. Taylor and Rosanas seem to take Millar's vision into account, talk amongst themselves, and then reply, "yeah, fuck that." I'm with them.
