Matthew Simmons, the local author and publisher of Instant Future, an e-novella imprint of Future Tense Press, has figured out a way to re-enact an American short story classic in *Grand Theft Auto*:

If those tweets put you in the mood to read "The Swimmer," it looks like [Library of America has made it available to read as a PDF](http://www.loa.org/images/pdf/Cheever_Swimmer.pdf). I hope someone figures out how to adapt Updike's "A&P" in *Batman: Arkham Knight* next.
