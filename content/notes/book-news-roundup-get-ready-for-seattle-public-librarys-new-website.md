* By now, you've likely heard about some drama involving nerdy sci-fi festival GeekGirlCon. The best take on this was a long thread spotlighted by Ijeoma Oluo on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you want to know what is going on with <a href="https://twitter.com/GeekGirlCon">@GeekGirlCon</a> please read this ENTIRE thread. Social justice language being appropriated &amp; abused. <a href="https://t.co/PF4ebiytAI">https://t.co/PF4ebiytAI</a></p>&mdash; Ijeoma Oluo (@IjeomaOluo) <a href="https://twitter.com/IjeomaOluo/status/894644918206865408">August 7, 2017</a></blockquote>

* The second-best take is from Teresa Jusino at The Mary Sue, which has the headline "[Former GeekGirlCon Volunteers Resign Over â€¦ 'Reverse Racism'?](https://www.themarysue.com/geekgirlcon-and-supposed-reverse-racism/)"

* In case you missed it last night, the [finalists for the Washington State Book Awards were announced](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/08/08/2017-washington-state-book-awards-finalists-announced/). Winners will be...crowned? Do they get crowns?..on October 14th at the downtown library.

* Speaking of the library, SPL unveiled a preview video showing their long-awaited website redesign, which looks pretty slick:

* What kind of an asshole [sues LeVar Burton for encouraging literacy](http://www.vulture.com/2017/08/levar-burton-sued-for-using-his-reading-rainbow-catchphrase.html)?
