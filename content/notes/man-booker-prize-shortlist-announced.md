And then there were six. Here's the Man Booker Prize shortlist:

*A Brief History of Seven Killings* by Marlon James

*Satin Island* by Tom McCarthy

*The Fishermen* by Chigozie Obioma

*The Year of the Runaways* by Sunjeev Sahota

*A Spool of Blue Thread* by Anne Tyler

*A Little Life* by Hanya Yanagihara

The last two books are by American authors, a first for the Man Booker Prize. Of those two Americans, Hanya Yanagihara is considered a frontrunner for the prize. And you'll have a chance to see her in person; Yanagihara will be [reading at University Book Store on November 20th](https://twitter.com/daviewheeler/status/643483335721795585), in conversation with Shelf Awareness associate editor [Dave Wheeler](https://twitter.com/daviewheeler).
