Yesterday, [I wrote that comics and cookbooks go together as perfectly as bread and butter](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/it-should-exist-but-it-doesnt/). I also pointed out that no publisher has put together a truly great, comprehensive comics cookbook. In comments on Facebook, though, a few readers pointed out that there are some more comics recipes out there for you to enjoy.

**Chris** suggested Tyler Capps's [weekly comic strip *Cooking Comically*](http://www.webtoons.com/en/slice-of-life/cooking-comically/list?title_no=622). I hadn't heard of this one before. Capps uses a blend of photography and comics to lay out his recipes. I'd appreciate a little more cartooning in his strip — the process could be slightly more stretched out and explained more thoroughly — but it's a neat blog and I happily subscribed to it.

Queen Anne Book Company bookseller **Tegan** recommended [a vegetarian cookbook called *Dirt Candy*](http://www.qabookco.com/book/9780307952172), by Amanda Cohen, Ryan Dunlavey, and Grady Hendrix. This one looks like a graphic novel.  Here, [from the Dirt Candy website](http://www.dirtcandynyc.com/), is a sample of a couple pages:

<p class="image">![](/webhook-uploads/1494574037440/book-3_1024x1024.jpg)</p>

Now, maybe this will make more sense once I actually look at the book. But I don't understand why you'd have a whole book told in comics form and then switch over to prose for the recipes before switching back to comics again. Still, I'm excited to check this book out! I'm not a vegetarian, but I do love to cook and eat vegetarian meals, and this book looks like an interesting hybrid.

And **Alex** said that [*Cook Korean! A Comic Book with Recipes*](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/252746/cook-korean-by-robin-ha/9781607748878/) by Robin Ha is getting great reviews. This one does look very close to my idea for a good comics cookbook. Get a load of this chunk of a full-page spread showing off a Korean refrigerator (The next page in the book explains what everything is:)

While none of these three recommendations quite fit the bill of what I was talking about in my post, they're certainly very close, and they demonstrate that people are playing around with the form. I think this proves that the field of cookbook recipes is rapidly advancing, and one day soon I will have my dream book on my cookbook shelf.

Most importantly, **thanks to Chris, Tegan, and Alex** for the tips! These are all great recommendations. I'm excited to have a new weekly cooking blog to read, and the next time I'm out I'll definitely check out these two books. If I have any thoughts on *Dirt Candy* or *Cook Korean!* after checking them out, I'll share them here. And if you have any other recommendations, please feel free to [drop us a line on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/seattlereviewof/).

**UPDATE 10:55 AM**: And in [the Facebook comments to this post](https://www.facebook.com/seattlereviewof/posts/1363584823710758?comment_id=1363593100376597&notif_t=share_comment&notif_id=1494610769642139), Seattle cartoonist **Colleen Frakes** writes:

<blockquote>The [Trees & Hills Comics Group](http://treesandhills.org/) has put out a couple of comic anthologies about food/recipes, one was "Seeds" (that one had my egg drop soup recipe. I cook a lot of soups) and the newer one is called "Sprouts". [*Saveur* was also running comic recipes for a while](http://www.saveur.com/site?string=comics).</blockquote>
