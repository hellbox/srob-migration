<p class="intro">Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles good for slow consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-sunday-post/" title="Sunday Post archives">look through the archives.</a></p>

<p>Friend of <em>SRoB</em> Rahawa Haile <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2170266/solo-hiking-appalachian-trail-queer-black-woman">returns to the Appalachian Trail</a>, this time on a road trip with her father. Speeding from BBQ to buffet, they take the first small steps toward knowing each other after a ten-year hiatus and map the distance that remains between.</p>

<blockquote>
Now, driving instead of hiking down these mountains, I learn that my father loves taking sharp turns too fast, something I never noticed growing up in the road-dull broadsheet that is Florida. I do not share his enthusiasm. I’ll take sore knees from 4,000-foot descents over feeling my inertia any day. I recognize for the first time just how much of him comes from the highlands of Eritrea. He's been courting death in this way since before I was born.

Also fascinating: the backstory of how the original article came to be, via an [interview with Haile](https://www.cjr.org/the_feature/appalachian-trail-outside-rahawa-haile.php) in the *Columbia Journalism Review*.

<p>Meet Ann Wroe, obituarist for <em>The Economist</em>, who&#8217;s eulogized the lives of figures as towering as <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21710922-cubas-communist-leader-who-outlasted-ten-american-presidents-has-died-age-90">Fidel Castro</a> and tiny as <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/14209766">a fish</a> (well, Benson was not so tiny, as fish go).</p>

<blockquote>
People think it’s a rather gloomy job, but it’s very seldom a sad job. Usually, the people you’re dealing with have lived for ages and have done really interesting things. It’s only when people die young that I think it becomes sad. I think of death as going into another place where you are as alive there as you are here. It doesn’t bother me at all.

<p>If you were born at a certain point in history, your childhood shelves included odd books about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Livingston_Seagull">stunt-flying seagulls</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_for_the_Flowers">sky-climbing caterpillars</a>, and this gem: Shel Silverstein&#8217;s <em>Uncle Shelby&#8217;s ABZ</em>. I was lucky enough to read it (likely while sitting in the middle of the street with a handful of firecrackers) before the &#8220;adult only&#8221; flag was added to the cover. Kevin Litman-Navarro celebrates Uncle Shelby and the consternation of several generations of unsuspecting parents.</p>

<blockquote>

Given all of the thinly veiled adult humor throughout the book, it seems quite clear that Uncle Shelby’s ABZ Book is not intended for children. But some distracted adults, it seems, neglected to actually read it before passing it to their sweet, impressionable young ones — today’s parental equivalent of giving a child unprotected internet access. One scandalized reader on the book review site Goodreads didn’t realize her mistake until she had already begun a family reading. “The truly shocking page,” she wrote, “was where he was joking about going with kidnappers and eating the lollipops they offer.”

<p>In its <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/features/athletes/alex-honnold/most-dangerous-free-solo-climb-yosemite-national-park-el-capitan/">exclusive on Alex Honnold&#8217;s free-solo climb (no ropes, no company) of the massive El Capitan</a>, <em>National Geographic</em> says Honnold&#8217;s &#8220;tolerance for scary situations is so remarkable&#8221; that he&#8217;s been a lab subject for neuroscientists fascinated by his ability to chill. Honnold&#8217;s take? &#8220;I just set [fear] aside and leave it be.&#8221; Philippe Petit, the man on the wire, has a somewhat more detailed and poetic anatomy of the deadly emotion.</p>

<blockquote>
A clever tool in the arsenal to destroy fear: if a nightmare taps you on the shoulder, do not turn around immediately expecting to be scared. Pause and expect more, exaggerate. Be ready to be very afraid, to scream in terror. The more delirious your expectation, the safer you will be when you see that reality is much less horrifying than what you had envisioned. Now turn around. See? It was not that bad.
