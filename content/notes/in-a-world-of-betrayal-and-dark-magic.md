If you like epic dark fantasy, stop reading this post and [go immediately to the sample chapter](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/) from sponsor Allen Batchelder's *Steel, Blood & Fire*. You'll find the not-so-heroic hero Tarmun Vykers sitting in the stocks, at the mercy of an entire village he's mysteriously offended. It's an irresistible opening, and so are the cameos by Aoife, a woman on a secret and possibly deadly mission, and Long Pete, a man whose destiny (at least for today) lies at the bottom of a flask. The first book in a series called Immortal Treachery, *Steel, Blood & Fire* is a fast-paced and gripping story, and we're delighted to share a taste with our readers.
