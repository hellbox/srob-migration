I got my ballot in the mail last night and I happily voted and mailed the damn thing back immediately and it felt so damned good, like the horse that's been sitting square in the center of my chest finally got up and moseyed away in search of some hay or something. (Not that you asked me or anything, but I heartily recommend [Seattlish's voting guide](http://seattlish.com/post/151982549421/the-official-seattlish-guide-to-your-ballot) to help identify the lesser-known names on the ballot.) This is almost over. We can do it.

In the meantime, [Melville House did a very good job of capturing the best #trumpbookreports](http://www.mhpbooks.com/trumpbookreport-gives-us-the-america-we-deserve/) that were spinning around Twitter yesterday. Some of them are very funny. Go read them, and [search the hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23trumpbookreport&src=typd), and laugh a little bit at the book jokes, and then vote, and soon — Nate Silver willing — you will never, ever have to think of that horrid man ever again.
