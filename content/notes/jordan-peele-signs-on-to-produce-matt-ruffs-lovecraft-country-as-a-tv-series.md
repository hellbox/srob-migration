Seattle novelist Matt Ruff's excellent novel [*Lovecraft Country*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/18/talking-with-matt-ruff-about-science-fictions-racist-past/) started its life as a pitch for a television show. Now, [the *Hollywood Reporter* says the cycle is complete](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hbo-orders-jordan-peelea-drama-lovecraft-country-bad-robot-1004446?utm_source=twitter), as *Lovecraft Country* (the novel) is heading to HBO. And *Get Out* director Jordan Peele is producing it, along with J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot production company:

<blockquote>The drama — described as an anthological horror series that reclaims genre storytelling from the African-American perspective — hails from Peele's Monkeypaw Productions, as well as Bad Robot and Warner Bros. Television. Peele and Green will executive produce alongside Bad Robot's J.J Abrams and Ben Stephenson.</blockquote>

Congratulations to Matt Ruff! This is terrific news. The series has been greenlit straight to series, so we hope to see it at some point in the near future.
