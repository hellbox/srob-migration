Yesterday, I told you that Arizona poet Natalie Diaz is in town for [a fantastic new series of events celebrating indigenous women writers](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/12/04/literary-event-of-the-week-poetry-across-the-nations-an-indigenous-reading/) called Poetry Across the Nations. 

What I failed to tell you was that Diaz's first Seattle event this week is [tonight at the downtown branch of the Seattle Public Library](https://www.spl.org/about-the-library/library-news-releases/natalie-diaz-and-john-freeman-1017). She'll be appearing in conversation with great literary editor John Freeman in a discussion about inequality and invisibilty in modern America. I interviewed Freeman a couple years ago, and I can tell you that he gives brilliant, thoughtful answers. I bet he and Diaz will have one hell of a fascinating conversation.

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1512457606086/talesoftwo.jpg)</p>

And while we're talking about Freeman, I hope you'll [join me tomorrow night at 7 pm at Third Place Books Seward Park](https://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/reading-through-it-tales-two-americas) for the final Reading Through It book club of 2017. We'll be discussing Freeman's anthology *Tales of Two Americas: Stories of Inequality in a Divided Nation*. It's a book that covers a lot of ground, from poverty to immigration to racism to homelessness. Basically, it's an opportunity to discuss any problem in America today, through the eyes of some of the sharpest writers of our time. Even if you haven't read the whole book, I hope you'll come out and join the book club tomorrow night. It's absolutely free, and the conversation will be hot and heavy.
