<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday June 14th: *You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me* Reading**</h5></p> 
Sherman Alexie is Seattle’s most entertaining reader, the most famous literary figure from Seattle, and one of our finest writers. And tonight he’s launching the biggest book of his career — a memoir about his complicated relationship with his mother. This reading is sold out, but Town Hall often has standby tickets available at the door.

 <p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday June 15th: Writers & Poets of Washington State**</h5></p>
Western Washington poets Gary Lilley and Ann Tweedy team up with Spokane story author Erin Pringle and Spokane novelist Sharma Shields to bridge the divide and bring eastern and western Washington together at last. For one night, let’s pretend the mountain range, desert, and broken political discourse that separates us just doesn’t exist.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday June 19th: *Discovering Seattle's Parks* Reading**</h5></p> 
Did you know that there are 426 parks in Seattle? Linnea Westerlind has visited every single one of them, and now she’s turned her blog about visiting them all, [YearofSeattleParks.com](http://YearofSeattleParks.com), into a fully fleshed-out book about those pockets of green which make our city so damn livable.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday June 20th: *Afterparty* Reading**</h5></p> 
Set in a near(-ish) future in which anyone can print drugs at home, *Afterparty* is about a designer drug that becomes the basis for a new religion. After the religion starts, people begin to die.  Author Daryl Gregory will discuss whether or not *Afterparty* was inspired through pharmaceutical intervention tonight.
