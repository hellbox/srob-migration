To make the banana naked, crack<br>
its neck and peel its jacket. To make<br>
the bed naked, throw back the sheet<br>
and the cotton blanket and the down one, too,<br>
along with whatever's been whispered to<br>
them in the damp minutes around midnight.<br>
To make the dog naked, let the mange<br>
rake and ravage, the tiny mites like<br>
humpbacked handmaids, plucking a hair,<br>
dropping it overboard, scraping away the skin. 

To make the moment naked, take a look<br>
right at it: Under your gaze, the wrapping<br>
of what might happen slides down<br>
its shoulder and slumps to the hardwoods,<br>
drowned in a pool of shadow. Nakedness

means _now_, the very is-ness of being. Time<br>
is nippling toward us and we dare not<br>
glance aside, dare not toss the subject<br>
out the window, flip the page to stop<br>
the topic of how to bear so much to bare. 

Branches in January are naked.

The inside of eggshells is naked. 

Wrong notes on the cheap guitar<br>
when the child is tired and sad are naked.

The bike, bound to the stop sign<br>
by a spiral of steel, shorn of its tires,<br>
stricken by the nightglow: naked. 

The man's face at the graveside<br>
of his child, a nakedness sheer<br>
enough to tear the fabric of everyone<br>
nearby and leave them dangling there,<br>
threadworn and bleeding out memory,<br>
skinned by the minute that is now upon us,<br>
shaved of everything but the we that are in it.
