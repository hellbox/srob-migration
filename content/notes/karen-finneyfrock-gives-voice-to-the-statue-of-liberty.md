Well, it's been another banner week in the history of our great republic. The democratic process has never seemed so...well, uh. Yeah. 

Maybe the appropriate way to close out your workweek, then, is to [listen to KUOW's Elizabeth Austen and Marcie Sillman introduce Karen Finneyfrock's poem "The Newer Colossus,"](http://kuow.org/post/what-would-statue-liberty-have-say-about-immigration-today) which is written from the perspective of the Statue of Liberty. Finneyfrock's version of Liberty is weary. She's seen too many anti-immigration hypocrites, from her island. "Quit your silly shit," she's basically telling us. 

Hopefully, we'll listen.
