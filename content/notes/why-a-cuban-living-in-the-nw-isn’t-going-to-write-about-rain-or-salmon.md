right off &mdash; there’s already enough rain<br>
I’m not inviting it into my poetry

salmon—this fish whose body<br>
torques up ladders  &mdash;<br>
has enough problems

if you’re Cuban<br>
and wind up in the Pacific Northwest  &mdash; <br>
the ecstasy of your dreams is pocketed until August  &mdash; <br>
the only month of certain heat

you troll the Asian produce stands<br>
for malanga, scotch bonnet peppers,<br>
and the elusive green plantain

you wait months for the only Desi Arnaz CD in the Seattle Public Library’s holdings  &mdash; <br>
even though there aren’t any other holds
