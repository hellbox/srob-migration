* Next Tuesday, outstanding sci-fi writing organization Clarion West is [hosting a reading and open mic at Naked City in Greenwood](https://www.clarionwest.org/brewing-other-worlds/). First, the open mic will encourage people to share short works, and then local sci-fi authors Randy Henderson, Seanan McGuire, Evan Peterson, and E. Lily Yu take over the stage. Tickets are ten bucks, and it benefits the Clarion West Writers Workshop. I hope you'll consider coming out and supporting emerging sci-fi writers.

* At [*Seattle Magazine*, Erica C. Barnett wrote](http://seattlemag.com/news-and-features/seattle-library-employee-was-stuck-needle-should-branches-make-changes-deal-opioid) about a Seattle Public Library employee who was stuck with a needle in a library bathroom. Unlike other library systems, SPL doesn't provide sharps containers — and for the most maddening reason in the world:

<blockquote>[SPL Spokesperson Andra] Addison says there’s a simple reason that the library doesn’t provide sharps containers for drug users: “We don’t allow illegal drug use in the library. It’s against our rules of conduct.” Providing sharps containers would be a tacit acknowledgement that people are using drugs at the library in violation of those rules.</blockquote>

* Okay, look. In a perfect world, nobody would suffer from opioid addiction. But we do not live in a perfect world. This dumb head-in-the-sand policy is endangering our librarians, and SPL needs to reassess their responsibility to their employees immediately. Thanks to Barnett for the great reporting.

* Great news! We [told you a couple months back](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2018/01/17/tonights-words-west-reading-benefits-one-of-seattles-best-neighborhood-independent-coffee-shops/) that West Seattle coffeeshop C&P Coffee, home to the Words West readings series, was in danger of closing unless they could raise the funds to save the site from development. [They have successfully raised the money](http://westseattleblog.com/2018/03/it-is-a-home-it-is-your-home-c-p-coffee-announces-its-raised-the-money-to-purchase-and-preserve-the-coffee-house/), which means C&P isn't going anywhere. Thanks to all who helped.
