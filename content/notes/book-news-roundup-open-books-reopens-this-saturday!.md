Find the whole list at [the Seattle Public Library's website](http://www.spl.org/about-the-library/library-news-releases/wsba-finalists-announced-914).

* Get ready for an insufferable press tour! The most criminally negligent president of our lifetimes is [putting out an art book](http://crownpublishing.com/feature/president-george-w-bush-publish-book-honoring-courage-sacrifice-americas-military-veterans/#.V9nJL1DyuB1) in February of next year:

<blockquote>The Crown Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC, announced today that it will publish a new book by George W. Bush, the 43rd President of the United States. Titled PORTRAITS OF COURAGE: A Commander in Chief’s Tribute to America’s Warriors, the book features 66 full-color portraits and a four-panel mural personally painted by President Bush of service members and veterans who have served our nation with honor, and whom the President has come to know personally since leaving office.</blockquote>

* Lena Dunham will [represent independent bookstores on Small Business Saturday](http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/lena-dunham-is-new-spokesperson-for-indies-first/124888) this fall.

One million dollars is going toward a fancy new scoreboard for the fancy new stadium UNH is building. And the library...[is getting a measly $100,000](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/15/critics-question-spending-librarians-donation-scoreboard?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed&utm_campaign=c72eec25d2-DNU20160915&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1fcbc04421-c72eec25d2-199444225&mc_cid=c72eec25d2&mc_eid=5a987e3d6d).
