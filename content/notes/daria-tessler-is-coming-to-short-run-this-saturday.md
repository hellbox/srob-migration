<p class="intro">Portland illustrator and cartoonist [Daria Tessler](http://www.animalsleepstories.com/) is coming to the Short Run Comix & Arts Festival for the second time this year. She makes beautiful illustrations that feel like a blend of children’s book illustrations and 1970s countercultural comics. You can find her booth in the show and she’ll also be performing in *The Midnight Variety Hour*, described as an “active participatory performance” at the Vera Project at noon.</p>

<p class="image">![](/webhook-uploads/1509082076908/musicofchanges.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">**Are you bringing anything new to the show?**</p>

<p class="noindent">Yes, I have *Accursed*, a book of ancient curses that was lavishly published by Perfectly Acceptable Press earlier this year. It's a 4 color riso book with a snazzy letterpressed cover. I also hope to finish a last-minute minicomic. Plus I'll have a few new silkscreens.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Are there any artists you're excited to see at Short Run this year?**</p>

<p class="noindent">I'm really excited to meet an artist whose Instagram name is [_abrownrecluse_]( https://www.instagram.com/_abrownrecluse_/), and whose real name is Jordan, who makes incredible stippled and layered drawings and minicomics. We plan to collaborate on a book project next year.</p>

<p class="noindent">**You've got a comic coming out from Fantagraphics next year! Do you see yourself moving away from minicomics and into the publishing side of things, or are you going to continue with a blend of self-produced and "professionally" published works?**</p>

<p class="noindent">I love hand-making books and printing small run publications using print methods other than offset printing. I'm sure I'll continue to work with those alternate types of bookmaking because they offer a different feel or mood and a special more personal art object. But working with a bigger publisher is great, you can create books that are more affordable to all kinds of readers and they get good distribution and you reach a larger audience. So both seem important to me.</p>
