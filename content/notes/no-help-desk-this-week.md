Cienna Madrid is celebrating the long Presidents' Day weekend by not offering any advice at all. Never fear: **she'll be back next week with an all-new column**. If you're desperately in need of a Cienna fix, may we humbly suggest you [investigate the Help Desk archives](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-help-desk/)? That's 25 weeks packed full of literary advice!
