<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_FASHIONPEDIA - The Ultimate Fashion Bible_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fashionary/fashionpedia-the-ultimate-fashion-bible?ref=category_newest). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Fashionary International Ltd](http://fashionary.org/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>A visual fashion dictionary with extensive information and easy-to-read layout in a compact size. Mini, but mighty.

</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	I love visual dictionaries. I mean, my job is a designer, and a well thought-out visual dictionary is one of my favorite books to hold. 
</p>

I remember seeing a Tumblr post that had diagrams for all the different kinds of, say, ladies shoes, or men's collars, or types of hats. Why is this interesting? Well, I'm a writer, and I want to talk with authority about the things that my characters, some of whom are fashion mavens, are wearing. That means I need to know.

A book like this is even better than some random internet gif. All the detail! All the fashion! All the facts! And, if you're not a writer, maybe you're a fashion designer. Even better.


<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">Unless you're like me, maybe you shouldn't. But, if you look at this campaign and kind of go _omg this is amazing_, like I did, then you probably should. I think it's fair to say this one is totally self selecting. Either you're going to get it or you're not, and if you do, just pointing to it is going to be enough for you to want it. I mean, just _look_ how amazing the design is. Seriously.</p>

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">They're totally kicking ass. 20 days to go, and they've raised about 330% of their initial bid. Look, they don't need you. But, ask yourself, do you need them?</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
