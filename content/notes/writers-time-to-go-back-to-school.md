<p class="noindent">Our sponsor <a href="http://mineral-school.org/" title="Mineral School | Mineral School - Arts Residency at Mt. Rainier">Mineral Schoo</a>l is in the midst of <a href="https://mineralschool.submittable.com/submit" title="Mineral School Submission Manager">receiving applications for their 2017 fellowships</a>. Let's see if any of these describe you: an early or mid-career writer of fiction, non-fiction, or poetry? A writing parent of a child under 18? A visual artist? There are residencies for you, spanning from full subsidized one-week stays, to two week residencies for the remarkable price of $425.</p> 

Oh, and they feed you. And have visiting writers come through. And you live in an old schoolhouse in Mineral Washington, a lakeside town with a sterling view of Mount Rainier. It's a totally unique, wonderful, and productive way to hunker down and focus on writing, and writing alone. On our <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">sponsor's page, see what Washington State Poet Laureate Tod Marshall write about his stay at Mineral School</a>.
