For five years, Lit Fix has been pulling down big and appreciative audiences on Capitol Hill, with proceeds going to local charities. Tonight, authors Megan Chance, Putsata Reang, Montreux Rotholtz, and Natalie Singer help to celebrate the books-and-music series.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday, March 14: *A Long Way from Home* Reading**</h5></p>
Australian author Peter Carey is a world-class talent, and I'm not just saying that because he's won a shelf full of awards. A Carey novel is always an intensely readable thing, and he's the rare kind of talent that doesn't preen or showboat. He's just interested in expending exactly the right amount of effort for every one of his books. His latest novel takes place during a car race around Australia in the 1950s, and it explores Aboriginal identity.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday, March 16: *Enlightenment Now* Reading**</h5></p>
Harvard professor Steven Pinker's new book says everything is great. No, really. Press materials say "in 75 jaw-dropping graphs, he shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise worldwide." Uh, okay, but the president is still a dumpster fire.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday, March 17: *Wonderland* Reading**</h5></p>
Portland poet Matthew Dickman, who has now published three poetry collections, reads with Portland historical novelist Emily Strelow. Strelow's book looks at two very different times in Northwest history - the late 1800s and the mid-1900s - to examine our Northwest character.

This afternoon, join Hedgebrook for a literary star-studded event featuring talks from playwright Sarah Ruhl and historian Annette Gordon-Reed and appearances from other Hedgebrook alumna.
