Over [at The Smart Set](https://thesmartset.com/always-a-critic/), Paula Marantz Cohen wrote a terrific piece about how one negative book review — written by Norman Mailer — changed the course of a friendship and a career.

<blockquote>If the personal is political, as the ’60s activists used to say, the political is, even more, inherently personal. When a smart, highly sensitive man like [Norman] Podhoretz is dramatically misread by most everyone he respects, when his dearest friend makes a laughing stock of him in print, is it surprising that he would be driven to separate himself socially and politically from everything such people stand for?</blockquote>

Can negative book reviews inspire a person, eventually, to become a horrific apologist for one of the dumbest wars in American history? You'll have to [read Cohen's](https://thesmartset.com/always-a-critic/) piece to find out.
