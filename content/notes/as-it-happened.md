Today is the 14th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. This morning, a Facebook user shared [this Warren Ellis fan forum thread](http://forums.delphiforums.com/n/main.asp?webtag=ellis&nav=messages&msg=23018.1&prettyurl=%2Fellis%2Fmessages%2F%3Fmsg%3D23018%2E1&gid=2040474526) from the day of the attacks. Reading through it, I realized I'd forgotten so many details from that day: the confusion, the fear, the hope, the hatred, the ugliness. 

In this one thread on a comic writer's forum, you can watch America turn itself upside down and rip itself apart. You can see the trajectory of the next 10 years, laid out in the frantic writings of a handful of scared people.
