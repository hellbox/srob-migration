<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday June 11th: *Lily and the Octopus* Reading**</h5></p> 
It’s not every Sunday that a bestselling author comes to town, but this afternoon screenwriter Steven Rowley reads from his literary phenomenon, which is about a sad man named Ted Flask who finds meaning in an octopus attached to his dog’s eye. How did this book top bestseller lists nationwide?  Maybe Rowley can explain.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday June 12th: *The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.* Reading
**</h5></p> 
Seattle novelist Neal Stephenson’s follow-up to the magisterial Seveneves is a co-authored novel with Nicole Galland. It’s about a language expert who gets wrapped up in a secret government agency over some documents which supposedly prove that magic has always existed. Set in the near-future, this one looks like it might appeal to fans of Stephenson’s lighter side.
