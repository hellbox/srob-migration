Our thanks to sponsor <a href="http://www.atelier26books.com" title="Atelier26 Books">Atelier26</a> for bringing the astounding book _Funny-Ass Thoreau_ to our readers this week. The book, released officially on Tuesday the 8th, covers a side of America's favorite recluse not seen in his more famous writings. 

There's <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships" title="The Seattle Review of Books - sponsorships">a great sample on our sponsor's page</a>, so we can back up this astounding statement: Thoreau was, indeed, a very funny man. But don't take our word for it, check out the book, and be sure to click through and pick up a copy if you like what you read. 

Do you want to be a sponsor, like the tremendous Atelier26? We have two openings in December, and one in January, before we're sold out of our current run. If you have something to advertise for the holidays, now is your time! Check out the available dates <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">on our booking page</a>, or more details <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor" title="The Seattle Review of Books - Sponsor the Seattle Review of Books">here</a>.
