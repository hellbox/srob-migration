 <p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday May 11th: Borough Body**</h5></p>
Tennessee painter Douglas Degges teams up with Seattle writer Chelsea Werner-Jatzke to create two maps of the New York City subway system: one told visually and one told with words. Maybe one day, Seattle’s subway system will be large and complicated enough to inspire works of art like this.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday May 12th: *Love and Trouble* Reading**</h5></p> 
Bainbridge memoirist Claire Dederer debuts her much-anticipated new book. Subtitled *A Midlife Reckoning*, *Love and Trouble* is about what happens when Dederer finds herself in an unexpected state of sexual reawakening. The book juxtaposes Dederer’s youth and her midlife into a single narrative, tied together through eroticism.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday May 13th: *Eartha* Reading**</h5></p> 
Fantagraphics cartoonist Cathy Malkasian’s latest book, *Eartha*, is a splendidly illustrated graphic novel about a brave young woman in a strange world where people read news printed on biscuits and then very publicly cry. It’s about the internet. [Here's my interview with her, which we published on Monday](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/05/08/im-being-so-manipulative-cathy-malkasians-latest-comic-is-a-polemic-against-social-media/). At this event, Malkasian will appear in conversation with Fantagraphics co-founder Gary Groth, who knows a thing or two about interviewing.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday May 15th: Keller Family Lecture with Jeffrey Toobin**</h5></p> 
This year’s annual Keller Family Lecture is delivered by Jeffrey Toobin, who is the *New Yorker*’s Supreme Court expert, which makes him one of the world’s leading Supreme Court experts. But Toobin has also written books about the Obama administration and, most recently, Patty Hearst. So it’s anyone’s guess as to what this talk will be about
