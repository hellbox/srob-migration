Laura Lippman has written over 20 works of detective fiction and has won a butt-ton of awards. David Simon created *The Wire*, which is a TV show that you wanted to hate because nobody could shut up about it but then you watched it and it was really just that brilliant.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday, March 31: Sorting Room Residency Reading**</h5></p>
The most important thing that a writer needs is peace and quiet. Seattle7Writers offers a low-key residency called The Sorting Room, which is a humble room for writers to write in. Tonight, three Sorting Room residents - Matthew Bennett, Janet Buttenwiser and Sierra Nelson - will share work they've written in the room. This event will also raise awareness for Seattle 7 Writers' Pocket Library program, which donates books to "shelters, food banks, correctional facilities, and other places with readers in need of books."
