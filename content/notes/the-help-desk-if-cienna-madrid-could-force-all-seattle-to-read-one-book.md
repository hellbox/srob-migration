<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 
<p class="noindent"><strong>This year, the Seattle Public Library chose Angela Flournoy’s *The Turner House* as the Seattle Reads selection — as in, the one book they wanted everyone in Seattle to read this year.</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>I’m dying to know: if you had the power to make everyone in Seattle read one book, what would that book be?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Dinah, Central District</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>P.S. If you ever wanted to start your own misanthropic version of Oprah’s Book Club, I’d be a charter member.</strong>

<p class="noindent">Dear Dinah,</p>

<p class="noindent">I have been sitting on your question for months now and each week, my answer has changed. My favorite recommendations are spontaneous and personal – for instance, a conversation about my dead aunt's newly-discovered secret 70's love child sparked a recommendation to read Katha Pollitt's *Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights* (not because my cousin should've been aborted, but because my aunt had no safe, legal recourse other than adoption at the time).</p>

So you can understand how encouraging an entire city of people to read just one book is daunting. The kind of people who could answer that question unblinkingly are the kind of people who have only read three books in their lifetime – for them, choosing a favorite is easy.

In past weeks, I would've recommended Amy Bloom's *Lucky Us* because it is so funny and beautifully written that I have actually confused lines in the book for memories of my own, or *Kindred*, by Octavia Butler, because Butler lived and died in Seattle and despite her powerful stories, not enough people in the region know her name or worship her writing. 

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1500655551691/cadillac%20desert.jpg)</p>

But if I had to choose a book this week, it would be Marc Reisner's *Cadillac Desert*, which is a nonfiction book about the diversion of rivers and damming of the American west. Reading about our untenable water policies is not as fun as reading Bloom or Butler would be, but it is a fascinating and necessary book for westerners. Seattle may not suffer from a water shortage, but it is the de facto democratic capital of the west and should be a leader when it comes to progressive water policy, and this book pretty clearly spells out the ecologic and economic disaster we're going to face if we don't re-evaluate how we use and think about water. Also: the only people I've found who've actually read this book are homeless-looking white men with REI budgets.

Along with a ton of other useful shit, like comprehensive sex ed and how to responsibly handle a credit card, *Cadillac Desert* is the kind of history lesson that should be taught in schools – or at least discussed among a wider audience than redwood-humpers with briar-patch beards and gear that costs more than my mortgage.

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
