If you've ever wanted to own the remains of a famous writer's body, [this is your best shot](http://www.vulture.com/2016/08/you-can-now-own-truman-capotes-ashes.html).

<blockquote>The famed author's cremains — which are stored in a Japanese wooden box and dated from August 28, 1984 — have been put on sale at the Los Angeles–based auction house Julien's Auctions. "I am sure people are going to think this is disrespectful," Julien's Auctions chief executive Darren Julien told Vanity Fair. "But this is a fact: Truman Capote loved the element of shock. He loved publicity. And I’m sure he’s looking down laughing, and saying, 'That’s something I would have done.'"</blockquote>
