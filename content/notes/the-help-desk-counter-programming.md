<p class="intro">*Every Friday, Cienna Madrid offers solutions to life’s most vexing literary problems. Do you need a book recommendation to send your worst cousin on her birthday? Is it okay to read erotica on public transit? Cienna can help. Send your questions to* advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Dear Cienna,**</p> 

<p class="noindent">**My son hates to read. The rest of the family? That's all we do. We don't have a TV, even. The other five of us could pass every moment of every day with our noses in a book, but our son wouldn't read chocolate if it were a book. We bought him a computer, and he's getting pretty good at programming and really likes it, but I think he needs to let his eyes rest from all of the vibrating pixels every now-and-again. He thinks we're all (the wrong kind of) nerds, and wants us to learn more about the internet. What kind of compromise do you think we can find? **</p>

<p class="noindent">**Georgia in Georgetown Heights**</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Georgia,</p>

<p class="noindent”>You can't force your loved ones to enjoy your hobbies – if that were possible, all of my friends would be wild about American Girl cosplay and farm-to-table spider farming. That said, if your son is programming, he *is* reading – you just don't get his language.</p>

<p class="noindent”>So buy him a few books that suit his interests and make a parental decree: Read for an hour, then your child can computer (and yes, you should definitely be letting him show off his internet skills). The method works: It's how I eventually weaned my cat off porn. </p>

<p class="noindent”>It's difficult to recommend specific books without knowing your son's age and abilities but [*Python for Kids: A Playful Introduction to Programming*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781593274078) and [*3D Game Programming for Kids: Create Interactive Worlds with JavaScript*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781937785444) both come highly rated for kids 10+. If he's a little bit older, I'd throw in William Gibson's cyberpunk classic, [*Neuromancer*](http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780441569595). In fact, that might be a fun book to read and discuss as a family book club project, you nerds.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
