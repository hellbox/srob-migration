<p class="intro">Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles we enjoyed this week, good for consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that’s your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-sunday-post/" title="Sunday Post archives">look through the archives.</a></p>

<p>By an accident of timing, the Sunday Post has the last word on 2017 at the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em>. </p>

<p>When I agreed to collate this weekly list, it was just after Donald Trump&#8217;s election; the news cycle hadn&#8217;t yet <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/us/politics/trump-news-overload.html">shifted into something past lightspeed</a>. Truth was still truth, <a href="https://medium.com/wordsthatmatter/truth-matters-2f281b5a748d">more or less</a>, and <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/11/20/art-monstrous-men/">powerful men weren&#8217;t monsters</a>, or at least we weren&#8217;t yet <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories">saying so out loud</a>. We knew that Donald Trump was a racist and that his election <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/my-president-was-black/508793/">represented something ugly embedded in this country</a>. We didn&#8217;t understand — those of us who had the privilege not to already live and breathe it — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/27/the-year-in-nazi-propaganda-images-of-white-supremacy-in-trumps-america">how ugly and how deep</a>.</p>

<p>As happens after a visceral blow, we were numb for a while, huddled under shock blankets and waiting for the pain to hit.</p>

<p>Then it did hit, hard. And writing on the internet became a firestorm of Trump-centered emotion and analysis: grief and fury, resignation and defiance, reflection and contention. Much of that writing is stunning in its depth and force.</p>

<p>And yet, and brilliantly, people still committed millions of words and images to simply <a href="https://kottke.org/17/09/rip-the-broccoli-tree">celebrating the oddity and beauty of the world</a>.</p>

<p>And yet, and brilliantly, people still committed millions of words and images to simply talking about things like books.</p>

<p>By treating <em>words and ideas and books</em> as if they matter, these writers ensure that <em>words and ideas and books</em> continue to do so.</p>

<p>So: Usually the Post covers writing that happens off the site. But I&#8217;m ceding the last word of 2017 (here at <em>SRoB</em>, at least) to the reviewers, poets, artists, and essayists who wrote about books for the <em>Seattle Review of Books</em> this year. Each of them, in their own way, transformed the fire around us — took the heat, and turned it back around.</p>

<h5>A year in reviews</h5>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Robert Lashley</strong> wrote eloquently and with passion about <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/words-written-in-anger-words-written-in-ink/">Ta-Nehisi Coates&#8217;s <em>We Were Eight Years in Power</em></a> and showed us the thoughtful, personal, eloquent book obscured behind cheap shots and hot takes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sophia Shalmiyev&#8217;s</strong> review of <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-mourning-pause/">Eileen Myles&#8217;s <em>Afterglow</em></a> was breathless and reckless and startling and perfect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Donna Miscolta</strong> wrote several pieces for us this year, but her essay on the language of rape and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-language-of-justice/">M. Evelina Galang&#8217;s <em>Lolas&#8217; House</em></a> is the one that left us speechless, which <em>believe me</em> is not easy to do.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/drawn-from-felt/"><strong>Kelly Froh</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-angry-doodler-reviews-private-citizens-by-tony-tulathimutte/"><strong>Siolo Thompson</strong></a> reviewed books by drawing comics, which is maybe the coolest thing ever.</p></li>
<li><p>Contrariwise, <strong>Colleen Louise Barry</strong> and <strong>Jessica Mooney</strong> reviewed comics by writing words. Both of their pieces are standouts: Barry&#8217;s review of <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/let-lightning-snake-reveal-yourself-to-you/">Jason T. Miles&#8217;s <em>Lightning Snake</em></a> adeptly captures the book&#8217;s disorienting disjointedness. The opening to Mooney&#8217;s review of <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/among-the-ruins/">Kristen Radtke&#8217;s <em>Imagine Wanting Only This</em></a> is heartwrenching, and her exploration of why we&#8217;re drawn to decaying things is perceptive, empathetic, and smart, smart, smart.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nick Cassella</strong>, in his review of <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/unstacking-the-deck/">Richard Reeves&#8217;s <em>Dream Hoarders</em></a>, and <strong>Jonathan Hiskes</strong>, covering <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/why-cant-literature-deal-with-climate-change/">Amitav Ghosh&#8217;s <em>The Great Derangement</em></a>, tackled some of the terrifyingly large social and environmental issues of this year (and unfortunately, but unquestionably, the year ahead).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samuel Filby</strong> looked at <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/strange-bedfellows/">Maged Zaher&#8217;s <em>Opting Out</em> through the lens of Richard Rorty&#8217;s <em>Philosophy as Poetry</em></a> through the lens of Socrates and Derrida. A knowledgeable and wide-ranging brain-bender of a review.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;If you have never been close to death, then this book is probably not for you.&#8221; That&#8217;s <strong>Dujie Tahat</strong> on <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/heavy-is-the-head/"><em>The Crown Ain&#8217;t Worth Much</em>, by Hanif Willis-Abdurraqib</a>, reminding us that poetry is in no way distant or distinct from real life, and pushing hard on our assumptions about the Black Lives Matter movement as he does it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore</strong> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/07/17/no-pastors-or-pews-talking-with-anastacia-rene%C3%A9/">interviewed Anastacia-Reneé</a> about violence, injustice, and our home city. <strong>Ivan Schneider</strong> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/06/05/talking-to-ourselves/">interviewed David Shields</a>, then wrote him a long letter about talking dogs.</p></li>
<li><p>And <strong>Anca Szilágyi</strong>, whose <em>Daughters of the Air</em> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/a-fairy-tale-of-new-york/">was just released</a>, explained <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/translation-is-not-kale/">why we&#8217;ve all been thinking about translation in the wrong way</a> — in an essay that includes one of my favorite lines of the year, and perhaps the best possible close to 2017: &#8220;To all this I say: <em>poppycock</em>.&#8221;</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>A year in verse</h5>

<p>The fact that our year in poetry started with battle, with <strong>Elisa Chavez&#8217;s</strong> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/01/03/revenge/">&#8220;Revenge&#8221;</a> (&#8220;rest assured,/anxious America, you brought your fists to a glitter fight&#8221;), and ended in a hot bath, with <strong>Sarah Jones&#8217;s</strong> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/12/26/when-i-finally-get-that-claw-footed-tub/">&#8220;When I finally get that claw-footed tub&#8221;</a> (&#8220;the heat a rising redemption/misty and heaven-bound&#8221;), makes me gleeful — they&#8217;re the perfect bookends (sorry, couldn&#8217;t resist).</p>

<p>This year the site was graced by an incredible range of <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/tuesday-poem/">Poets in Residence</a>: in addition to <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/elisa-chavez/">Chavez</a> and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/sarah-jones/">Jones</a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/jt-stewart/"><strong>JT Stewart</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/jamaica-baldwin/"><strong>Jamaica Baldwin</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/joan-swift/"><strong>Joan Swift</strong></a> (posthumously), <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/oliver-de-la-paz/"><strong>Oliver de la Paz</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/tammy-robacker/"><strong>Tammy Robacker</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/kelli-russell-agodon/"><strong>Kelli Russell Agodon</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/daemond-arrindell/"><strong>Daemond Arrindell</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/esther-altshul-helfgott/"><strong>Esther Altshul Helfgott</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/kary-wayson/"><strong>Kary Wayson</strong></a>, and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/emily-bedard/"><strong>Emily Bedard</strong></a>. If you haven&#8217;t been following the Tuesday poem, top off your cup and catch up now.</p>

<h5>A year in columns</h5>

<p>Our columnists have a regular platform to talk about what they love — explain why it matters, and show us how the world looks through its lens, even when that world is run, seemingly, by a madman with bad hair.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Nisi Shawl&#8217;s</strong> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-future-alternative-past">Future Alternative Past</a> is a masterclass on SFFH. Her knowledge of the genre is comprehensive, and she approaches it with a completely fresh critical lens and a fine eye for relevance. See, for example, her column on <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/10/12/future-alternative-past-lets-talk-about-fat-positivity-in-sci-fi/">fat positivity in science fiction</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Olivia Waite&#8217;s</strong> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/kissing-books/">Kissing Books</a> touches on <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/12/07/kissing-books-historically-speaking/">race</a> and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/11/02/kissing-books-the-other-f-word/">feminism</a> and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/10/05/kissing-books-she-works-hard-for-it-honey/">socioeconomic issues</a> — all the hard, smart ideas that romance novels are supposed to not contain but do. And her <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/09/27/robert-gottlieb-is-obviously-smitten/">takedown of Robert Gottlieb</a> was epically excellent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Daneet Steffens&#8217;s</strong> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/criminal-fiction">Criminal Fiction</a> is a monthly reminder that reading is a pleasure. The joy she takes in what she reads is evident in every capsule review and interview.</p></li>
<li>Whoever your favorite author may be, you&#8217;ll love them a bit more after <strong>Christine Marie Larsen</strong> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/portrait-gallery/">captures them in a portrait</a>. (For me, it's this one of <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/10/19/portrait-gallery-g-willow-wilson-redux/">G. Willow Wilson</a>.) Her talent for conveying the kindness, compassion, and humor of her subjects is very welcome in these angry times.</li>
<li><p>Two new columnists started sharing their pen-and-ink perspective on the world at <em>SRoB</em> this year: <strong>Aaron Bagley&#8217;s</strong> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/aaron-bagleys-dream-comics">Dream Comics</a> are charming and odd and full of import; <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/11/03/aaron-bagleys-dream-comics-body-language/">this one is about whales</a>. <strong>Clare Johnson&#8217;s</strong> <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/11/24/novembers-post-it-note-art-from-instagram/">Post-It Note Art</a> is quiet and personal and expressive far beyond the boundaries of a three-by-three square.</p></li>
<li><p>Nobody addresses humanity&#8217;s relationship with the written word, and all the shame and social awkwardness and anxiety it provokes, as regularly and accurately as <strong>Cienna Madrid</strong> in <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-help-desk/">the Help Desk</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>Oh, right. Martin and Paul.</h5>

<ul>
<li>Did you know co-founder <strong>Paul Constant</strong> likes to walk? He does. He <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/10/16/meet-the-cartoonist-behind-seattle-walk-report-if-you-want-the-worst-time-of-your-life-go-on-a-walk-with-me/">walks</a> and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/seattle-step-by-step/">walks</a> and <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/walking-around-seattle-with-jane-jacobs/">walks</a>. His review of <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/with-a-single-step/">Neal Stephenson&#8217;s <em>Seveneves</em></a> talks about why, with characteristic clarity and piercing lyricism.</li>
<li>Did you know co-founder <strong>Martin McClellan</strong> was in a band? He was. For the Thanksgiving essay this year (yes, <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/thanksgiving-essay/">that&#8217;s a thing</a>, and so is the <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/christmas-ghost-story/">Christmas ghost story</a>), he talked about a country earwormed by Donald Trump. And then he gave us <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/11/23/morning-terror-nights-of-dread/">a playlist to survive to</a>.</li>
