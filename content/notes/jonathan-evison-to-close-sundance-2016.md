The bad news is that the film adaptation of local author Jonathan Evison's spectacular novel *The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving* has been changed. It's now *The Fundamentals of Caring*, a title that sacrifices specificity at the altar of sentiment.

But! Here's the good news: it stars Paul Rudd, so I will still be there for this movie whenever it opens locally. And here's the even-better news: [it was announced last week](http://www.finalreel.co.uk/the-fundamentals-of-caring-first-look/#more-15650) that *The Fundamentals of Caring* will be the Closing Film at this coming year's Sundance film festival, a position of pride that indicates confidence in the quality of the film. Might we get to see it at next year's SIFF? Here's hoping.
