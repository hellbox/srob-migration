In case you weren't keeping track, [Arundel Books](http://www.arundelbookstores.com/home.html), which used to be a beautiful bookstore on 1st Avenue downtown, is now a beautiful bookstore in the old Wessel & Lieberman space facing Occidental Park in Pioneer Square. And Arundel founder Phil Bevis still publishes books, both under the [Arundel Press](http://www.arundelbookstores.com/publications.html) shingle and, more expansively, as [Chatwin Books](http://www.chatwinbooks.com/). (One of Arundel Press's titles, Nicole Sarrocco's [*Karate Bride*](http://www.karatebride.com/KB2.html), is a Seattle poetry classic.)

Bevis has just announced that Chatwin Books is publishing collected poetry editions (with previously published and new work) from three poets: [Maged Zaher](http://www.themonarchreview.org/three-poems-maged-zaher/), [Jack Grapes](http://jackgrapes.com/grapes_bio.php), and [Rex Wilder](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/rex-wilder). 

Zaher's will be the first in the series. Titled *Opting Out: Collected Poems (2000-2015)*, it will be out sometime this winter. Next will be *Last of the Outsiders: The Collected Poems of Jack Grapes Volume I*, out in late winter or spring 2016, with the second, still untitled, volume arriving later in the year. *The Collected Poems of Rex Wilder* will be published in spring of 2016. (Bevis thanks Red Hen Press for giving "generous permission to use work from" Wilder's [two recent Red Hen releases](http://redhen.org/authors/?author_UUID=A51AE7E1-F163-8D36-18A2-B1BC736822A3).)

Wilder and Grapes are both California poets. Zaher is a proud Seattleite (by way of Egypt), and a substantial collection of his work is a big deal for the Seattle literary scene, even moreso because he's being published by a Seattle press. Expect to hear a lot about this book in the next few months.
