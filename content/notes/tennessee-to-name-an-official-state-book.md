I am all for the idea of states naming official books. (*Make Way for Ducklings* is, adorably, Massachusetts's official children's book.) But I'm not a fan of [this move](http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/04/bill-make-bible-official-state-book-heads-haslam/82625250/):

<blockquote>Tennessee is poised to make history as the first state in the nation to recognize the Holy Bible as its official book.</blockquote>

The problem is, of course, Tennessee lawmakers aren't just naming a state book by doing this; they're effectively naming Christianity the official state religion. Instead of the Bible, a book that I can promise was neither written nor set in Tennessee, why not make Cormac McCarthy's semiautobiographical novel *Suttree* the state book instead? It's set in Tennessee, and it's an underappreciated McCarthy novel. Why not promote literacy, rather than waging a petty and unnecessary religious war?
