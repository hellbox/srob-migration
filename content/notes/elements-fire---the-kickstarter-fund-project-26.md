<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_ELEMENTS: Fire_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beyondpress/elements-fire). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Beyond Press](https://www.beyond-press.com).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>ELEMENTS: Fire - A comics anthology by creators of color</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	This is an awesome looking comics anthology, the second from the same group that made the [Beyond Anthology](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/335445879/the-beyond-anthology), and were so successful that they're turning this into a comics publishing house. 
</p>

Every creator is a person of color. They were given a theme to run with ("our fire"), and the result is this anthology that seeks to publish, and pay the creators a fair rate for their work. Beyond that, the work is done, so this Kickstarter is just to fund the printing and production.

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
Because you like comics, and you like that indie comics now have a way of publishing where they don't have to prove themselves to some middleman. But mostly, back it because the work looks like it will be awesome, and the first anthology won a Lammy for LGBT Fiction Anthology from the [28th Annual Lambda Awards](http://www.lambdaliterary.org/features/news/06/07/28th-annual-lammy-award-winners-announced/). That means the editors, Taneka Stotts, and Shin Yin Khor, know what the hell they're doing. 
</p>

Also, it's based out of Portland, so local pride!

<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	They're 34% funded with 30 days to go. I think they'll be fine. Hop on while there's still some early bird specials to be had!
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
