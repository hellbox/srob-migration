As I said yesterday, I am loving the newfound attention Colson Whitehead is receiving. If you're unfamiliar with Whitehead's work, [this interview with Jennifer Schuessler of the *New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/books/colson-whitehead-on-slavery-success-and-writing-the-novel-that-really-scared-him.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0) is a great way to learn about him.

<blockquote><p>He mentioned a bookstore owner from the South who invited him to come down for “a frank talk about race.”</p>

<p>“I’m honored by the response to the novel, but I was like, ‘Can we just talk about the book?’” he said. “I’m not a representative of blackness, and I’m not a healer.”</p></blockquote>

Hugo House is bringing Whitehead to the [Seattle Public Library on Saturday, September 17th at 7 pm](https://hugohouse.org/event/colson-whitehead/). Start getting excited now.
