<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_"This is Fine" Plush Dog_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kcgreen/this-is-fine-plush-dog?ref=nav_search). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[KC Green](http://kcgreendotcom.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
Official plush merch based on the comic/meme that is becoming all too relatable these days. Take the edge off and hug a boy.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	Okay so this isn't a book, let's get that straight right away. It's a comic that went memeish, and now gone plush. You've seen it before, it's this one: 	
</p>

<p class="noindent">
	<p class="image">![](/webhook-uploads/1470502870972/658.png)</p>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
	It's been popular lately, what with the election and all. And although the most of the "this is fine" sentiment has been aimed the feelings of overwhelming frustration at the Repbulican nominee, the GOP made a tone-deaf use of image:

</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DemsInPhilly?src=hash">#DemsInPhilly</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EnoughClinton?src=hash">#EnoughClinton</a> <a href="https://t.co/qVywJM90Eu">pic.twitter.com/qVywJM90Eu</a></p>&mdash; GOP (@GOP) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOP/status/757687865471963137">July 25, 2016</a></blockquote>

Which inspired The Nib to do something amazing: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">. <a href="https://twitter.com/GOP">@GOP</a> We actually paid the artist who made this. Here&#39;s what he came up with. <a href="https://t.co/4D4bmx9ccp">pic.twitter.com/4D4bmx9ccp</a></p>&mdash; The Nib (@thenib) <a href="https://twitter.com/thenib/status/757790230350929921">July 26, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">
		And then <a href="https://thenib.com/this-is-not-fine" title="None">comission an update</a>. Now, you can buy your boy, the burning melting dog, in stuffie format. With a coffee cup that says "This is fine."
	</p>


<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	I'm no hipster throwing pennies into the well of irony, but even I have to admit this particualr meme talks to me. And buying this is a way to reward the artist for giving us the zeitgeist, so neatly packaged and perfectly delivered. Plus, you can get him with a cardboard room to sit in. This is fine, the huggable version.
</p>


<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	They don't need your money, but support a comic artist anyway. Let's line his brilliant pockets.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
