<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1499099932962/sponsorship-by-you-small.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">We've just released [sponsorship dates through January 2018](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/). They're going fast, but there's still plenty of time to [grab a slot](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/).</p> Got a breakthrough book to promote, an amazing event, or a class or retreat that Seattle's active community of readers and writers should know about? We'd love to help you get the word out.

Our sponsors get an exclusive presence, appearing on every page of the site for a full week, with a special mention on the home page and in our social media feeds at start and finish. Our favorite bit: the chance to hook readers by offering a sneak peek at a chapter or more. Check out this week's special feature &mdash; [a young author's harrowing journey](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) &mdash; to see what it looks like.

Sponsorship costs $150 for a full week of promotion to our engaged and passionate readers. And it supports all of the great writing you see on the site, from our [weekly columns](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/06/15/future-alternative-past-deadish/) to our [Poet of the Month](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/01/03/revenge/).

[Sign up now](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/) to get your preferred dates, or [email us](mailto:sponsorships@seattlereviewofbooks.com) with questions.
