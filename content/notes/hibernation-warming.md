Wind kicks a few cups down the alley.<br>
Pocketful of stones, a greasy lot.<br>
Morning chill in fleeting sunlight.

You’d rather stay under this blanket agreement.<br>
Not any storm can house you off the cuff.<br>
The troposphere brushes your cold turned cheek.

Wake up. Get the child to school.<br>
Now you are alone in this story<br>
of cornflakes and Tuesday frost.

If you smell gas leak, all the more reason.<br>
If you can walk back your talking point<br>
happier still. Confusion in the hypodermis.

Poverty of whiteness<br>
or hostile witness &mdash;<br>
you’ll need a hole to crawl into

soon enough. Who lingers<br>
finds the daylight wary. Who wavers<br>
stands for nothing still. Hyper

nation state of being always out of<br>
reach for the sky. Though you thought<br>
your silence golden. 

Though you felt like running<br>
until your feet grew wings. This very morning<br>
a crooked heartbeat stalked you out the door.
