You should absolutely [read Noah Davis's overview of what it means to be a freelance writer in 2015](http://www.theawl.com/2015/09/dox-dox-dox-ii-the-doxxing). 

<blockquote>Many newer outlets offer upwards of fifty cents per word or more—sites like The Verge might pay a dollar per word—as do established publications including *New York*'s blog network and *The Guardian*. “You can expect that two hundred and fifty dollars is an ultimate baseline for anything that you do,” Kyle Chayka, a New York-based freelancer, told me. “No one is paying less than that. My own perception is that fifty cents per word is a fair going rate for an experienced freelance writer who’s writing something primarily for web that’s been reported.” But still: figure twelve hundred or fifteen hundred words per piece, and you’re talking closer to twenty cents per word. “That’s depressing math when you’re doing your budget,” Erik Malinowski, a freelancer writer, said.</blockquote>

It's not all bad news — more outlets are paying freelancers than ever before — but freelancers are balancing on a cliff made from venture capital cash, and publishers still, almost *two decades* after the birth of the mass-market internet, don't know how to make money out of advertising clicks. (We have [our own revenue system](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/) here at *Seattle Review of Books*, and the response has been solid, though we could always [use more Sponsors](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/).) 

So what can you do as a reader? In short, it's tough out there for freelancers and if you read a piece you like, you should share it far and wide, because clicks (unfortunately) are the way that most publishers determine a piece's worth. If you *really* like a piece, you should write in to the publication to let them know how much you like it. And, as always, a little bit of praise never hurt anyone; maybe track the writer down on Twitter or Facebook and let them know how much you enjoyed their writing.
