It's time! The application period for 2018 residencies at the Mineral School is open. You've only got until February 15, 2018, to [put your name in the hat](https://mineralschool.submittable.com/submit) — and we recommend that you do. Mineral School is impossibly cool, a reformed elementary school in a [quirky small town](http://mineral-school.org/location-and-history/) near Mt. Rainier. It attracts great writers and artists, some of whom we're proud to have published on the *Seattle Review of Books* (like [Clare Johnson](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/11/24/novembers-post-it-note-art-from-instagram/) and [Kelly Froh](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/drawn-from-felt/)). And it's two weeks of focused time to work, let your brain re-shape to the mountain and the lake, and be fed by someone who knows their way around a kitchen.

We're delighted to have Mineral School back as a sponsor, though jealous, as always, of the people who'll actually take those residency slots. Check out our sponsorship page for [details on the 2018 program](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorship), and get a sneak peek at what what Mineral School alumni are publishing next year.

Sponsors like the Mineral School make the *Seattle Review of Books* possible. Did you know [you could sponsor us, as well](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/)? If you have a book, event, or opportunity you’d like to get in front of our readers, [reserve your dates now](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/).
