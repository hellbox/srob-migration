I’m five years old.<br> 
We’ve just been buzzed into Aunt Miriam’s house.<br>
Uncle Ben’s office is to the right, off the hall.<br>
Before walking upstairs to the second floor,<br>
I look to the right and see dark.<br>
Mother holds my hand while I peak in:<br> 
Equipment. The kind the Nazis used?<br>
No, for taking x-rays.

Overheard: Once, he gave me medicine<br>
to abort my baby but it didn’t work<br>
and the baby was born with an extra thumb.

I’m thirteen years old now.<br>
Uncle Ben’s been dead eight years.<br>
Daddy says the only good German is a dead German.<br>
That was 1946 and Uncle Ben can’t practice medicine<br>
at Johns Hopkins hospital. No Jews allowed.<br>
Is that why he doesn’t smile?

I don’t know how to like him.<br>
He doesn’t look at me.<br>
He has a Doberman Pinscher named Prince.<br>
When women come to the house,<br>
Prince looks under their dresses.<br> 
Men laugh. Women are embarrassed.

In the basement of Aunt Miriam’s house,<br>
a ping pong table and knotty pine walls.<br>
Once when I was nine<br>
a cousin played ping pong with me.<br>
He was sixteen. Now I’m sixteen<br>
and I read about a man the Nazis put in a freezer.<br>
to see how much cold a human being can withstand.<br>
When the man’s testicles turned blue, he collapsed<br>
and guards dragged him out. A doctor records<br>
how much time it took for the man to die,<br>
but I don’t remember what the number said.
