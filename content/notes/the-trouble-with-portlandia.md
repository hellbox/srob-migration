[Yesterday, I told you](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/09/29/book-news-roundup-the-feminist-bookstore-from-portlandia-lashes-out/) that In Other Words, the feminist bookstore featured in the TV show *Portlandia* under the fictional name Women & Women First, had put a "Fuck *Portlandia*" sign in its window, and when the *Willamette Week* reached out for comment, bookstore staff told the *Week* to "go fuck themselves."

Now, In Other Words has [written a post](http://inotherwords.org/2016/09/28/fuck-portlandia/) explaining the sign. Also titled "Fuck *Portlandia*," the post makes a great case for why In Other Words doesn't want to play by the show's rules anymore:

<blockquote>This was a direct response to a particular egregious filming of the show in our space which saw our store left a mess, our staff mistreated, our neighbors forced to close and lose business for a day without warning, and our repeated attempts to obtain accountability or resolution dismissed.</blockquote>

The post, [which you should definitely read](http://inotherwords.org/2016/09/28/fuck-portlandia/), explains a bunch of specific reasons why the store staff decided not to be involved with the show anymore: insufficient pay for use of the space, the questionable trans politics of the "deeply shitty joke" of Fred Armisen in a dress, and the fact that *Portlandia* staff reportedly asked In Other Words to remove the "Black Lives Matter" sign from their front window, along with other points.

It will no doubt be easy for reporters to make cheap "unfunny feminist" jokes about this post, but In Other Words makes a legitimate case here as to why they don't want to participate in *Portlandia* any more. I'll be curious to see if the show even bothers to respond to their allegations. If they do, I'll let you know.
