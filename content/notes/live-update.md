Teju Cole [published a poem at the *New Inquiry*](http://thenewinquiry.com/blogs/dtake/live-update/) in response to today's terrible news out of San Bernardino. It's a moving reminder that poetry can respond to current events, can be as timely as a thinkpiece, can be so much more meaningful than a hot take on Twitter.
