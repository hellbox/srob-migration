Italian news sources [are reporting](http://www.corriere.it/cultura/16_febbraio_20/morto-umberto-eco-6a6c8fac-d760-11e5-a4d1-c8704a1e2204.shtml) that author Umberto Eco has passed away. He turned 84 years old last month. Eco is the author of two global bestsellers: *Foucault's Pendulum*, a playful conspiracy thriller; and *The Name of the Rose*, a murder mystery set in a Benedictine monastery. I especially enjoyed Eco's underrated 2004 novel *The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana*, a deeply personal tribute to the comics and pulp literature of Eco's youth, as well as a rumination on memory and aging. Eco's novels were always fun and elegant and rewarding on multiple levels; he created beautiful labyrinths. 

Between this news and Harper Lee's passing, this has been [a very sad day](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/19/harper-lee-1926-2016/) for literature.
