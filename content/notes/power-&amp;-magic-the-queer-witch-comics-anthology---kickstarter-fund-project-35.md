<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_POWER &amp; MAGIC: THE QUEER WITCH COMICS ANTHOLOGY_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/131668411/power-and-magic-the-queer-witch-comics-anthology). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Joamette Gil](http://powerandmagic.tumblr.com).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
15 comics about queer witches of color, created by 17 women, demigirls, and bigender people of color.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	I've always loved stories about witches. Out of all the mythical creatures, witches are most relatable because they are fundamentally about how society views women. Unlike vampires, say, that maybe represent a single angle of men, there is a witch for every view of women. They may be good, or evil, benevolent or merciless. But one thing that witches always are: resourceful and independent, two traits society frowned upon in women, historically.
</p>

<p>
	And more so for women of color. So yes: more stories about witches. And yes: more stories about queer witches of color. It's a great premise, and from the artwork on the site, and the list of contributors (uh, the coven, although counting the cover design I count 15 projects in this piece, so maybe it's a baker's coven) is strong and interesting.
</p>


<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	Comics! Witches! Queer witches! Queer witches of color! I mean, need I say more?
	</p>


<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	30% funded with 28 days to go. Good trajectory, but let's see if we can help them out and spread the world. Every bit helps.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
