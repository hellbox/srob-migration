It's true that Donald Trump has admitted to never reading books. But in case you think he doesn't care about books, please note that [the Huffington Post revealed](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-book-donor-money_us_580e7b09e4b02444efa4e7c4?rv5) that Trump bought $300,000 in small donations to his campaign on books last month. Of course, the books he bought were copies of his ghost-written memoir *The Art of the Deal*. Weirdly, Trump also offered signed copies of *The Art of the Deal* as a fundraiser, even though...

<blockquote>Trump’s statement calling the book “out-of-print,” repeated on the committee’s website, however, is false. The Art of the Deal had a new paperback edition printed last October, and the hardcover is currently in print and available from Random House and retail booksellers. Barnes and Noble, for example, sells it for $22.35.</blockquote>

So Donald Trump isn't just a liar. He lies about books. How much lower can you get?
