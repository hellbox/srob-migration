Carolyn Kellogg [at Jacket Copy](http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-hugo-awards-the-complete-finalist-lst-20160426-story.html) has the full list of the sci-fi/fantasy Hugo Award finalists. Here's the novel category:

*    *Ancillary Mercy* by Ann Leckie 
*    *The Cinder Spires: The Aeronaut's Windlass* by Jim Butcher 
*    *The Fifth Season* by N.K. Jemisin 
*    *Seveneves: A Novel* by Neal Stephenson 
*    *Uprooted* by Naomi Novik 

Kate Macdonald [reviewed the first book in Leckie's Ancillary series, *Ancillary Justice*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/pronouns-in-space/), for us last year. And our cofounder [Martin McClellan reviewed Stephenson's *Seveneves*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/sticking-the-landing/) almost a year ago. 

Of course, last year, [the Hugo Awards finalists were overtaken by a horde of men's rights dimbulbs](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/23/hugo-award-winners-announced/), and I see some of those same names on some of the categories again this year. But those conservative jackasses didn't win any awards last year, and they won't win this year. Let's not make the story about a few loud and crass white men. Instead, let's celebrate the sci-fi writers who deserve our celebration.
