Jason Weisberger [writes about](http://boingboing.net/2016/07/12/vandals-wage-war-on-san-franci.html) a San Francisco Little Free Library that was targeted by some vandals. This is, of course, outrageous and I'm glad they keep putting the Library back up.

However, I have noticed that we've seen a flood of Little Free Libraries in Seattle over the last year and a half, and I must say that **the quality of books in those libraries has markedly decreased**, with a lot of magazines, hopelessly battered paperbacks and dated technical books popping up all around town. 

I think, and I do not have any data to back this up, the problem is that perhaps there are **too many Little Free Libraries in Seattle**? The quantity of Libraries is perhaps finally outstripping the quality of their stock. 

I'd invite anyone considering launching a Little Free Library of their own to investigate the situation in their neighborhood — if there's another Library five or six blocks away from your home, maybe you should just work as hard as you can to contribute to the pre-existing one? After all, as [Cienna Madrid pointed out](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/26/the-help-desk-my-local-little-free-library-is-a-disaster/) back in February, it takes a community to raise a Little Free Library.
