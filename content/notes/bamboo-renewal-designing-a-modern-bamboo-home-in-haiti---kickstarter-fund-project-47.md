<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Bamboo Renewal: Designing a modern bamboo home in Haiti_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/heliotrope/bamboo-renewal-designing-a-modern-bamboo-home-in-h?ref=profile_created). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Swoon / The Heliotrope Foundation](konbitshelter.org).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
Together with a village in rural Haiti, we will design and build a home that brings an ancient building material into the present.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>
	
<p class="noindent">
A non-literary project today. Brooklyn-based street artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/swoonhq/?hl=en" title="Swoon Studio (@swoonhq) â˘ Instagram photos and videos">Swoon</a> (Caledonia Curry) went to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, and worked with local artists, architects, engineers, and builders to create a community center for the village of Comiers. It was a huge success &mdash; using adobe, and other traditional building materials &mdash; and created shared structures that could withstand hurricanes and earthquakes.
</p>

In the years since, working with local farmers, and training residents in construction, the foundation has built another house, as well as run arts education projects with the residents. Now, Konbit Shelter is turning its attention to building a home for Louisiana Pierre Louis. Louis lost her son and daughter-in-law in the earthquake, and their kids, her grandchildren, have returned from Port Au Prince to live with her.

It was the community that choose her as the best possible recipient for the house &mdash; and one thing that is impressive about the way that Konbit Shelter doesn't helicopter in with solutions &mdash; they go and work with the community on what their needs are, and then bring in thoughtful design and architecture to address them. 


<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
Because it's a great idea, a great project, and they need help making the finish line. Spend a few bucks that will make you feel good, today. 
</p>


<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	54% funded, and 17 days to go. Pitch in, and help them make their goal!
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
