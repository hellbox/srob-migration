A singular talent, a life-saving artist who constructed a brilliant career, and [a passionate reader](http://electricliterature.com/david-bowies-100-favorite-books/): to call David Bowie one-in-a-million would be to seriously devalue his uniqueness. Maybe he was one-in-a-species, but he made us all feel like we could be better people. There's not a single dud on his top-100 book list, which was found and shared this morning by Lincoln Michel at [Electric Literature](http://electricliterature.com/david-bowies-100-favorite-books/). Also, [the Seattle Public Library has put together a list of Bowie-related books](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/list/share/72535308_rainy_day_librarian/571420248_david_bowie_book_list) for you. (Get a load of [Bowie's wonderful pro-library poster](https://twitter.com/CNRGillLibrary/status/686587336260468737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), too.)
