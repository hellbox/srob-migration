When I was a girl<br>
I wanted to live<br>
inside of one. 
 
A wooden, small<br>
place to hold me.<br>
I was in love 
 
with its bird<br>
face. I imagined us<br>
married. The dream 
 
of domesticity. Keeping<br>
house à la bric-a-brac<br>
or conversation piece.  
 
But time has told<br>
what makes them tick.<br> 
More machinations 
 
than magic. Dark<br>
pastoral scenes<br>
and a stiffness  
 
crowns the eaves.<br>
Clockmakers all carve<br> 
the same male game  
 
in their overhang.<br>
Reared buckhorns<br>
and alpha beasts &mdash; 
 
They rule the ornate<br>
roost. And it’s a heavy<br>
pull on me. Those two  
 
coniferous strung<br>
weights dangling<br>
their gonadal hang.
