Our January Poet in Residence, [Kevin Craft](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/kevin-craft/), is a writer who has a deep understanding of Seattle's literary tradition and has taken on an active role as a caretaker of that tradition. (You'll hear more from Craft in an interview on that exact subject tomorrow.) Our February Poet in Residence, Azura Tyabji, is one of the newest and most exciting poets in our Seattle tradition. 

As [Marcie Sillman wrote in the summer of last year](http://kuow.org/post/world-ending-yes-you-have-seen-it-end-and-begin-again-morning), Tyabji, a Seattle native and a student at Nova High School, burst onto the scene thanks to some nurturing poetry teachers and the great local organization [Youth Speaks Seattle](https://www.artscorps.org/programs/teen-leadership/youth-speaks-seattle/). She's a prolific writer and spoken word performer, and she has already represented our city at the national Brave New Voices slam.

We'll be running poetry by Tyabji every Tuesday of this month, and we'll sit down for an interview with her in the next few weeks. We hope *Seattle Review of Books* readers will enjoy and share the work of this bold new voice in Seattle poetry.
