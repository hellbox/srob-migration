1. The (I guess NSFW, maybe?) photograph of [the "naked language mural" by artist Vladimiro Lunardon up at The New Post-Literate](http://thenewpostliterate.blogspot.com/2016/03/naked-language-mural-by-vladimiro.html) is a thing of beauty. It's exactly what reading great literature feels like to me. Lunardon's art employs [lots of writing-like imagery](https://www.facebook.com/Vladimiro-lunardon-146087905413487/photos_stream), and some of it is really quite beautiful.

2. The great Roger Langridge has [a new cartoon of "Abandoned First Drafts"](http://hotelfred.blogspot.com/2016/03/abandoned-first-drafts.html) up on his blog for your enjoyment. (I would absolutely read that fourth panel.)

3. Chip Zdarsky's [addition to the conclusion of *Frankenstein*](http://zdarsky.tumblr.com/post/141274340631/huh-who-knew) solves one of literature's greatest problems.
