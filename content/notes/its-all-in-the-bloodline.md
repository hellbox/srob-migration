We're so pleased to announce Anne Kelleher as this week's sponsor. She's the author of over a dozen books, and her career has bridged major publishing houses and agents, to forging new ground in self-publishing.   

Her latest _The Jesus Gene_ is a thriller that wonders what would happen if a modern-day person really did carry the bloodline of Jesus Christ. [Read the prologue on our sponsors page](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships).
