Since Shelf Awareness published the rumors that [Amazon is preparing to open a bookstore in University Village](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/08/amazon-to-open-bookstore-in-university-village/), Geekwire has [done a little digging](http://www.geekwire.com/2015/amazons-bookstore-revealed-blueprints-provide-new-clues-about-mysterious-seattle-site/) into Seattle public records and uncovered blue prints for a space that "will **combine elements of an Apple store and a Barnes & Noble**, with areas for browsing books and checking out and buying new devices." It's a [huge space](http://www.geekwire.com/2015/amazons-bookstore-revealed-blueprints-provide-new-clues-about-mysterious-seattle-site/).
