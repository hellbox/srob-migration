_Seattle, at the old World's Fair_

He stands by the helm, his face full of blue<br>
from the buildings at twilight, his hand<br>
knuckled around a metal pole that keeps him<br>
from falling, as he flies past the vaults<br>
of startled mannequins, the red ohs of their lips.<br>
Christmas lights are also falling<br>
through the windshield, onto his chest:<br>
right side green, left side red &mdash;<br>
dark then back again. 

Wait&hellip;my father is not moving yet:<br>
no one has claimed the worn leather throne. <br>
But his thoughts are moving, wondering<br>
whether movement is the same as growing old<br>
in the province of space, not time. Inside his shoes,<br>
his toes are as blue as the city streets,<br>
and the drum in his chest, his red-lit chest,<br>
is growing dim. He knows the train he's about to ride<br>
has one rail: no steering, no turns.<br>
And the only skill is in the brake. 

The brake. His lips roll over the words:<br>
_the dead man's brake_. And a small boy<br>
&mdash; come to ride up front &mdash; hears him,<br>
tugs my father's coat and asks:<br>
_Hey mister, are you the driver of this train?_
