We're thrilled to have Kelley Eskridge back as a sponsor this week. Her fantastic book _Solitaire_ has been turned into a feature film, titled _Otherlife_. That means it's time to read the book before the film arrives into the world. [Read the entire first chapter](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships) on ours sponsors page. Also, check out Kelley's writing [about what it was like to write this film based on her book](http://kelleyeskridge.com/drink-and-have-feelz-olj-1/).

If you're a small publisher, writer, poet, or foundation that is looking to back our work, and advertise your own in an inexpensive and expressive way, [take a look at our open dates](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/). We'd love to talk to you about opportunities to sponsor us.
