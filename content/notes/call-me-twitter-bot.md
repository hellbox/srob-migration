Are you following the *Moby Dick* bot on Twitter? It frequently posts random tweet-sized quotes from the text of *Moby Dick*, and sometimes it feels eerily appropriate for the day and time. Or maybe it's just that every tweet seems appropriate for the Trump administration. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">from hell&#39;s heart I stab at thee; for hate&#39;s sake I spit my last breath at thee</p>&mdash; Moby Dick (@MobyDickatSea) <a href="https://twitter.com/MobyDickatSea/status/942844675924418560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2017</a></blockquote>

There's something to be said for the synchronicity of a freshly appropriate Melville quote smacking you across the face in your timeline. It's kind of like watching a fin break the surface of the water and knowing that there's something more, something bigger, going on beneath the surface.
