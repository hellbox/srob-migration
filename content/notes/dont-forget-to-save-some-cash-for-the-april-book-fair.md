Don't forget that this Saturday, from noon to 4 pm, the APRIL Book Fair is happening at Hugo House. 27 local publishers — including the *Seattle Review of Books* — will have tables full of merchandise for sale. [Find a full list of vendors right here](http://www.aprilfestival.com/expo/).

All I'm saying is this: if you're on a budget, and you're thinking about hitting the bars on a weeknight this week, maybe stay home and invest in some literature this weekend. You'll thank me later.
