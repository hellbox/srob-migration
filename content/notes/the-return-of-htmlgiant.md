HTMLGiant, the popular literary blog that shut down two years ago, just started [publishing again this morning](http://htmlgiant.com/random/move-to-trash/), with seemingly no notice. They're also starting an [anonymous advice column](http://htmlgiant.com/blind-items/beatrice-anonymous-advice-on-revenge-beauty-and-life/).
