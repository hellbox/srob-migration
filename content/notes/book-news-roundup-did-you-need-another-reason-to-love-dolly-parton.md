* Emerald City Comicon is coming this weekend! The fantastic [Sarah Anne Lloyd at Curbed](https://seattle.curbed.com/maps/seattle-comic-book-shops) compiled a handy list of Seattle-area comics shops to visit over the weekend. I have to admit, I had never heard of Burien's [Ancient Comics](https://www.facebook.com/Ancientcomics-278474455532743/) until I read this list and now I can't wait to check it out. 

* The Seattle Public Library's [Shelf Talk Blog](https://shelftalkblog.wordpress.com/2018/02/27/worldbuilding-in-comics/) is celebrating ECCC with a list of worldbuilding comics, including Faith Erin Hicks's excellent Nameless City series.

* Applications close tomorrow for [Clarion West's summer workshops](https://www.clarionwest.org/workshops/summer/). If you're an aspiring sci-fi writer, you should get involved with Clarion West; they're an amazing resource.

* Ta-Nehisi Coates [is writing a *Captain America* series](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/02/we-who-love-america/553991/?utm_source=atltw). The first issue will be published on July 4th.

* Fantasy author Terry Goodkind became an internet villain this week when he [encouraged his fans to mock his most recent book cover](https://io9.gizmodo.com/fantasy-author-terry-goodkind-wants-everyone-to-know-ho-1823323895), which was illustrated by Bastien Lecouffe Deharme. I've literally never heard of an author shitting on his own book cover in public. Goodkind is [known as an Ayn Rand acolyte](https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?742364-The-Sword-of-Truth-Just-how-bad-does-the-objectivism-propaganda-get); it's not too surprising that he has no idea how to act like a decent human being.

* But let's not dwell on the horrible people in the world. Let's celebrate the truly great human beings out there, like Dolly Parton. Why am I talking about Dolly Parton on a book site? Because of [this story from the *Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2018/02/27/dolly-parton-likes-to-give-away-books-she-just-donated-her-100-millionth/?utm_term=.e61095cde5d8): Parton just donated her hundred millionth book. Yes, her **100,000,000th** book.

<blockquote>Parton is the founder of Imagination Library, a nonprofit that started out donating books in Sevier County, Tenn., and grew into a million-book-a-month operation. Families who sign up receive a book per month from birth to kindergarten. The singer donated her organization’s 100 millionth book to the nation’s library on Tuesday.</blockquote>
