<p><strong>Dear Cienna,</strong></p>
 
<p class="noindent"><strong>It's Summertime and that means car trips with the kids! Both my rugrats love reading, and will happily while away the hours (that they're screen-restricted) with their nose in books. They're seven and ten right now. Any good suggestions for things to keep them happy and humming along so I can listen to my podcasts in peace, and have a bit of time to mess around setting up the tent without them whining that they have dirt in their sandals?</strong></p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Bob, Queen Anne</strong></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Bob,</p>

<p class="noindent">Fortunately for you, I have a 12-year-old sister and 10-year-old brother (the eggs in my family have a long shelf life). I made a vow when they were younger, and that vow was to buy them books for every major holiday and to never question the origins of their birth, even though – and I'm not being melodramatic here – they might actually be demons. </p>

Look at the evidence: they both shot out of the womb cackling instead of crying, we had to file their teeth down to a congenial size (pity we couldn't do the same for their heads), and last Valentine's Day my brother gave me a homemade card that read: "God has abandoned you. Love Max."

Nevertheless, I do love them. They affectionately call me "Spinster Queen," I affectionately call them human, and I have remained faithful to my vow, except for the Christmas I bought them a trampoline and rape whistles because their parents pissed me off.

Based on my experience, here are a few books your children might like: *Wonderstruck*, *The Book Thief*, the Captain Underpants series, and for your older child, anything by [the Norwegian cartoonist Jason](http://www.fantagraphics.com/artists/jason/), whose minimalist stories are especially well suited for road trips (be forewarned: his work is rather dark... I hear my siblings doing spit takes with holy water while reading it).

<p class="noindent">Kisses,</p>
<p class="noindent">Cienna</p>
