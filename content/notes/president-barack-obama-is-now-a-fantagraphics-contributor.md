Big news from Seattle comics publisher Fantagraphics tonight, [via the *New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/business/media/obama-pays-tribute-to-charlie-brown-snoopy-and-the-peanuts-gang.html?_r=1): President Obama has written the foreword for the upcoming 25th volume of *The Complete Peanuts*, the chronological reprinting of Charles Schulz's newspaper strip. (This volume collects the very end of the series from 1999 through Schulz's death in February 2000, although a 26th *Complete Peanuts* volume, collecting ephemera and rare artwork, will be published this fall.) Go [read the story](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/business/media/obama-pays-tribute-to-charlie-brown-snoopy-and-the-peanuts-gang.html?_r=1) to find out how Fantagraphics scored such a coup.
