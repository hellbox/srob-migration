It was kind of a boring new comics Wednesday from the mainstream publishers, so I decided to dive into the minicomics section of [Phoenix Comics & Games]( http://phoenixseattle.com/) to see what local cartoonists are working on. Or, in one case, what local cartoonists *were* working on; I had never seen the 2014 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fanzine *Notorious R.B.G.* before, so it was new to me. (It also predated the 2015 Christmas bestseller [*Notorious R.B.G.*]( https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062415837/notorious-rbg) by a year.) 

The zine from poet Amber Nelson, cartoonist Colleen Frakes (author of [*Prison Island*]( http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/journey-to-prison-island/)) and cartoonist Neil Brideau, which is “Dedicated to Ruth Bader Ginsburg with apologies to Beyonce,” is a collection of song lyrics rewritten from Ginsburg’s perspective. (“My mother told me two things;/to be a lady and to be independent.”) As a tribute to Ginsburg, and to the other women on the Supreme Court, it’s a delight, and at two bucks, it’s a steal. My favorite bit is the two-page comic-strip cover of “Flawless” that caps the book. (“Woke up like this/Flawless/Supreme Court steps/Flawless…”) 

[Joseph Laney]( http://josephlaney.com/)’s *Iron City Shorts* is a $4 minicomic collecting two short stories set in and around the fictional Iron City. The setting is a kind of retro-sci-fi groove, with giant robots and goggles and dirigibles. The first story, “The Big Knockover,” feels a bit slight, but the second story, “Escape the Past,” more than makes up for the first in terms of storytelling strength. “Escape” begins with a prison break (from, as a caption helpfully informs us, “Gargantua Island Prison: one of City Harbor’s most notorious landmarks”) and continues with a twisty tale of revenge that incorporates several moral shades of gray. Laney’s sense of design is excellent. He packs a lot onto every page, and his chunky cartooning style — which kind of reminds me of a sci-fi [Dean Haspiel]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Haspiel) — serves the subject matter very well. He’s obviously put a lot of thought into Iron City as a setting and a theme, and hopefully this sampler will function as a springboard for more adventures soon.

Finally, [Eli Tripoli]( http://elitripoli.com/)’s *Me and the Muad’dib* is a demented mashup that somehow makes perfect sense: it’s a [Chick tract]( http://www.chick.com/gospel-tracts/?gclid=Cj0KEQjw0dy4BRCuuL_e5MeqmNABEiQAq8iNI__G-edqCtLwCtNkUYTAnNOfO9X2WeuOGaxyETBeO1MaAudi8P8HAQ)-style evangelical pamphlet extoling the mythology of Frank Herbert’s Dune series. While Tripoli’s art is primitive, the glorified stick figures ably serve the narrative — a pair of supporters of Paul Atreides try to convince a skeptic to believe in the Emperor of Dune. The language is spot on for a Chick tract parody: “Paul Atreides isn’t a giant fish, he’s the Kwisatz Haderach! He’s a person like you or me. And he was born here on Calderan, just like us!” As a celebration of Herbert’s super-weird mythology, it’s glorious — a respectful work of fandom that’s clearly born from a deep and abiding love. Come to think of it, that describes all three of these books.
