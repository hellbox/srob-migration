There are poetry events all over Seattle for National Poetry Month, but on Sunday April 17th, there's a great reason to take a trip out to Redmond. It's called Open Studio, and it features a bunch of great people:

<blockquote>Celebrate National Poetry Month through song, contemporary forays into poetic performance and collaborations between sound artists and writers in this event. Curated by Redmond Poet Laureate Shin Yu Pai.</blockquote>

And here are the performers:

* Jessika Kenney, vocalist/composer, accompanied by Behruz Alavi on Persian ney
* Sierra Nelson & Rachel Kessler (aka Vis-à-Vis Society), performance artists
* Alan Chong Lau and Susie Kozawa, poet/visual artist and sound artist/composer
* Srivani Jade (Srivani Jade Music), singer
* Levi Fuller (Levi Fuller & the Library), musician/producer
* Michael Dylan Welch, poet

We're big fans of Pai, the Vis-à-Vis Society, and Fuller in particular. This would make for a great Poetry Month pilgrimage.
