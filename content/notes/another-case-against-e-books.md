Nate Hoffelder [at the Digital Reader](http://the-digital-reader.com/2016/03/15/new-nook-hardware-could-become-worthless-in-the-uk-after-31-may-2016/) reports that Barnes & Noble is dropping its Nook e-reading service in the United Kingdom. If you own a Nook e-reader, that could turn out to be a real problem. For one thing, you might not be able to access your books anymore. For another thing...

<blockquote>...if you should have to reset a Nook UK device in June, **you won't be able to reauthorize it** to the same account. And if someone gives you a Nook UK device in June or later, you won't be able to log in using your current credentials.

And since B&N **requires that a Nook device be authorized** before you can use it, that is a problem.</blockquote>

Not to be a dick, but you literally never have to worry about this kind of thing with physical books.
