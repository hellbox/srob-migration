* Hugo House [announced their new Poet-In-Residence yesterday](https://hugohouse.org/announcing-2017-2018-poetry-writer-residence-made-hugo-house-fellows/). **Amber Flame** will be available for appointments starting on September 15th. 

<blockquote>Flame has regularly worked as an activist and organizer for a diverse number of theatrical, cabaret, queer, and POC communities — both during her time in the Bay Area and since returning to Seattle. Her connections to a broad network of artists and teachers also extends to the growing immigrant community and incarcerated populations through her work with [The IF Project](http://www.theifproject.com/), a program funded by the Seattle Police Foundation.</blockquote>

* Yesterday, Hugo House [also announced their newest Made at Hugo fellows](https://hugohouse.org/announcing-2017-2018-poetry-writer-residence-made-hugo-house-fellows/), which is a program that creates a cohort of young Seattle writers and gives them access to all of the Hugo House's mighty educational opportunities. The Made at Hugo program is a great way to take the pulse of Seattle's next generation of literary talent. You'll be seeing more of these names in the near future: "poet Holly DeBevoise, poet and writer Max Delsohn, writer Nia Dickens, poet Kym Littlefield, poet and artist Erin Lynch, and indigenous prose writer D.A. Navoti."

* Speaking of mighty educational opportunities! [Short Run's summer school](http://shortrun.org/summer-school-full-schedule/#more-614) looks like a lot of fun, with many free classes and all other classes below $50. Topics include letterpress printing, comics classes for kids, papermaking with local papercraft cartoonist Mita Mahato, and a class titled "**How to Be Self-Employed in Seattle**" that a lot of you should take.

* Last year, some unpaid employees of Emerald City Comicon — who are unfortunately dubbed "minions" by ECCC leadership — sued the convention for compensation. Yesterday, lawyers announced that [ECCC reached a settlement with the minions](http://smashpages.net/2017/06/28/comics-lowdown-eccc-volunteer-suit-settled/).Brigid Alverson at Smash Pages writes:

<blockquote>Under the settlement, Eitane Emerald Corp. and the Demonakos family will pay almost $500,000 to the volunteers, with the lawyers scooping up $123,300 for their troubles, [former "minion" Jerry Michael] Brooks [who filed the suit in the first place] getting $5,000, and the 250 or so other “volunteers” will divvy up the rest according to how many hours they worked.</blockquote>

* This [tweetstorm about BBC English](https://twitter.com/nick_kapur/status/879431974657695744) is a great illustration of how language evolves, and how what we think of as "normal" English probably didn't exist just a few short decades ago. A few highlights:
