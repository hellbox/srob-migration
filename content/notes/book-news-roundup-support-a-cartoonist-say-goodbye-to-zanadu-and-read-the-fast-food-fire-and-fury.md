* Seattle cartoonist [Sarah Glidden launched a Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sarahglidden). For just a buck a month, Glidden will give you access to her diary comics. Glidden notes that her personal comics lately have been about her pregnancy and impending motherhood, and "I thought it would be nice to have a little more of an intimate space for posting comics of such a personal nature." Glidden has [already produced two books of excellent comics journalism](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/19/new-hire-sarah-glidden-doesnt-believe-in-the-seattle-freeze/), and these personal strips give her an opportunity to share a different kind of story. 

* [Over at Seattle Refined](http://seattlerefined.com/lifestyle/local-comic-store-closes-after-42-years-of-service), William Harris mourns the slow passing of downtown comics shop Zanadu Comics. The store closes on January 28th.

* At *City Arts*, [Margo VanSynghel interviews Seattle author Ijeoma Oluo](http://www.cityartsmagazine.com/the-honest-truth-qa-with-ijeoma-oluo/), whose book *So You Want to Talk About Race* was published last Tuesday.

* What happens if you load *Fire and Fury* and a bunch of fast food advertising copy into an artificial intelligence? [You get sentences like](http://botnik.org/content/fire-and-fury.html): "As the Russia investigation seemed to be a problem for Donald, he told Priebus to get fifty more chocolaty-chip cookies shaped like the White House to try to create confusion over which was the one with the President in it."

* This, via [AbeBooks](https://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2018/01/19/germanys-parthenon-of-banned-books/), is simply stunning:
