* Seattle Media news, part one: Capitol Hill Seattle blog, which went on a hiatus last year, is now [up and running again](http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2017/10/chs-sabbatical-were-back/), with a staff and everything! (Joining CHS founder Justin Carder are photographer Alex Garland and great Seattle reporter Kelsey Hamlin.) CHS is looking for 2000 subscribers to put a few dollars a month into their Patreon account to pay for the work they do.

* Seattle Media news, part two: Ana Sofia Knauf, formerly neighborhood reporter at *The Stranger*, is now at [Seattle-area newsletter The Evergrey](https://theevergrey.com/5201-2/).

* The full Lit Crawl lineup just became available [on their website](http://litcrawl.org/seattle/2017-schedule). Highlights include EILEEN MYLES. And a lot more that we'll talk about in the coming days and weeks. But, really: [EILEEN MYLES](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/sorry-eileen-myles/).

* The [full lineup of this year's Short Run Comix & Arts Festival has been released](http://shortrun.org/full-festival-schedule-nov-2nd-5th/). Aside from the always-amazing convention floor show, highlights include panels featuring cartoonist Julia Wertz, *Bitch Planet* author Kelly Sue DeConnick, and a conversation between Emil Ferris (*My Favorite Thing is Monsters*) and Leela Corman (*We All Wish For Deadly Force*), moderated by me. The big show happens on Saturday, November 4th in Seattle Center.

* Bad news: if you're a freelancer who was recently approached by an editor at *The Atlantic*, the odds are good that you're [the victim of a scam](https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/archive/2017/10/statement-from-atlantic-media-general-counsel-aretae-wyler-on-scam-using-the-atlantic-names/542151/?utm_source=twb):

<blockquote>Across the last few months, individuals posing as our editors and senior leaders have sent fraudulent job offers to unwitting freelancers or jobseekers looking to work with The Atlantic. The impostors have created numerous misleading email accounts, including gmail addresses in the names of editors, gmail addresses that include the Atlanticâ€™s name (e.g., recruitment.atlanticmagazine@gmail.com), and addresses employing fake domains (e.g., @atlanticmediagroup.net).  The aim of the scam is to obtain personal information such as social security numbers, addresses, and bank account information from the intended victims. </blockquote>

* But here's something good and pure:
