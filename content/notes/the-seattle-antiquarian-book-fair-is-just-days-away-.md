<p class="noindent">The [Seattle Antiquarian Book Fair](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/) is back as our sponsor for one last week. This weekend, October 14th and 15th, they'll fill Seattle Center's Exhibition Hall from wall to wall with books, maps, and prints — almost a hundred vendors from the United States, Canada, England, and Spain.</p>

This is the kind of event to plan a weekend around. Start Saturday off with coffee and pastries (you'll need sustenance) and spend the morning and afternoon exploring the Fair's endlessly surprising stock of rarities. Come back on Sunday — one ticket gets you in on both days — to dive deeper with your favorite exhibitors. It's a once-a-year opportunity, different every year, and well worth the time.

Sponsors like the Seattle Antiquarian Book Fair make the _Seattle Review of Books_ possible. We're booked solid through the end of January (thank you, everyone!), but if you have a book, event, or project you'd like to get in front of our readers, [reach out and let us know](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/). We'd be happy to reserve a spot for you before the next block of dates goes public.
