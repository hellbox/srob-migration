<p class="intro">Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles good for slow consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-sunday-post/" title="Sunday Post archives">look through the archives.</a></p>

<p>Lindy West isn&#8217;t a social justice warrior, she&#8217;s a social justice apocalypse. Unsurprisingly, she&#8217;s already taking heat for her new weekly column in the <em>New York Times</em> — the Internet&#8217;s creepiest denizens have <em>very</em> little sense of irony. Keep publishing petty insults in Reddit forums with unprintable names, trolls; Lindy&#8217;s in the <em>NYT</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What we could really use, my guys, is some loud, unequivocal backup. And not just in public, when the tide of opinion has already turned and a little “woke”-ness might benefit you — but in private, when it can hurt.</p>

<p>One of my podcasting friends told me that he does stick up for women in challenging situations, like testosterone-soaked comedy green rooms, for instance, but complained, “I get mocked for it!”</p>

<p>Yes, I know you do. Welcome.</p>

<p>In the wake of the debate over <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html">David Wallace-Wells&#8217; <em>New York</em> magazine</a> piece, which describes a catastrophically uninhabitable planet within a matter of decades, revisit this quiet, lyrical essay from last month&#8217;s <em>Oxford American</em>. It&#8217;s a telescope-to-microscope shift: Wallace-Wells imagines a worst-case outcome on a global scale; Molly McArdle brings it back to the coast of North Carolina and a family with generations of investment in, almost literally, a castle built on sand.</p>

<blockquote>
These days — as the weather everywhere grows steadily stranger, storms stronger, seas higher — I worry about the Outer Banks, surrounded by water and just barely above the waves. What does it mean to be from, and of, one of the most vulnerable places on Earth? The Midgetts felt like a key. Six years after I first took note of them, I started the nine-hour drive down the coast to find what I could unlock with it.

<h5><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-blueprint-for-coexistence-with-artificial-intelligence/?mbid=nl_71217_backchannel_p3" title="A blueprint for coexistence with artificial intelligence - Backchannel">A blueprint for coexistence with artificial intelligence</a></h5>

<p>Is it <em>utopian</em> or <em>dystopian</em> to posit a world in which humanity&#8217;s unique value proposition — against a growing force of AI workers — is providing a compassionate interface while machines do the real thinking? AI researcher Kai-Fu Lee&#8217;s experience with lymphoma gave him a new perspective on his life&#8217;s work.</p>

<blockquote>
The answer I propose would never have come to me when I was myself somewhat of an automaton, living to work rather than the other way around. It was only my cancer diagnosis, and the sudden realization of what my own stupidity had made me miss, that led me to my suggestion. Our coexistence with artificial intelligence hinges on combining what is humanly unattainable—the hugely scaled narrow AI intelligence that will only get better at any given domain—with what we humans can uniquely offer to one another. And that is love. What makes us human is that we can love.
