Now that former White House senior advisor Steve Bannon is [back in charge of hyperconservative news outlet Breitbart](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-devil-eats-his-own-tail/), it's vitally important to note that Amazon is one of the last remaining mainstream advertisers on Breitbart. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/amazon">@amazon</a> Please stop advertising on Breitbart</p>&mdash; Andy Richter (@AndyRichter) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyRichter/status/898918911395090432">August 19, 2017</a></blockquote>

The organization Sleeping Giants has been on a crusade to convince Amazon to stop advertising on Breitbart. They responded to comedian Andy Richter's tweet above with an update on their crusade:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank, <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyRichter">@AndyRichter</a>! We&#39;ve been informing advertisers when they show up on Breitbart for 10 months. 2500+ have left. <a href="https://twitter.com/amazon">@amazon</a> doesn&#39;t care.</p>&mdash; Sleeping Giants (@slpng_giants) <a href="https://twitter.com/slpng_giants/status/898945034363445248">August 19, 2017</a></blockquote>

Think about that. More than 2,500 advertisers have realized that posting on Breitbart is bad for business. They've made the moral decision to stop advertising there. Amazon, after months of consumer advocacy from Sleeping Giants, still advertises on the site. 

What will it take for Amazon to stop giving Steve Bannon money? What if you sent them an email? What if you canceled your Amazon account and told them that you decided that you could no longer be complicit in advancing a white supremacist agenda? Maybe your voice will be the one that tips Amazon over onto the right side of history. 

It's vital to stop Steve Bannon from advancing his white supremacist agenda. Amazon is one of the last major mainstream funders of that agenda. They must stop advertising on Breitbart.
