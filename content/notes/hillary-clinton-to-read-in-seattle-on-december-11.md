If you would like to attend a public appearance of Hillary Clinton reading from [*What Happened*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/07/27/hillary-clinton-to-publish-a-memoir-about-the-2016-presidential-race-this-fall/), her memoir about the 2016 presidential campaign, [you can sign up here](https://hrclive.formstack.com/forms/seattlesignup). Clinton will be reading at the Paramount on December 11th. Tickets will go on sale on September 6th, and they will presumably not be cheap.
