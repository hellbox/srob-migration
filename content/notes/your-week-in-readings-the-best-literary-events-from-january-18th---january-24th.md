<h5>**Sunday January 22nd: *Looking for Betty MacDonald* Reading**</h5></p> Betty MacDonald’s 1945 memoir about life on the Olympic Peninsula, *The Egg and I*, is an underappreciated Northwest classic. Seattle-area historian Paula Becker celebrates the UW Press’s republication of three long out-of-print books by MacDonald with a reading from her book which celebrates MacDonald’s history and legacy.

<h5>**Tuesday January 24th: *This Is How It Always Is* Reading**</h5></p> 
 No less a towering talent than the Northwest’s own Ruth Ozeki praises Seattle author Laurie Frankel’s third novel, *This Is How It Always Is*, for charging us “to look beyond the traditional binary oppositions of boy vs. girl, right vs. wrong, real vs. make-believe, and to find courage and beauty in the in-between.”
