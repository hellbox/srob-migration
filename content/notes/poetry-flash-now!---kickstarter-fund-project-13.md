<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">_[Poetry Flash Now!](https://www.seedandspark.com/studio/ordinary-women#story)_. We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Poetry Flash](poetryflash.org).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>Help us build a new online home for our work so that we can better serve &amp; support the literary communities of the West Coast &amp; beyond.</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	_Poetry Flash_ has been around since 1972, a poetry calendar mixed with a literary review. It's a website now, but was used to live in print, and still does live through a reading sereies in Berkely and through organizing festivals. This publication is a labor of love, and just look in the video at all of those poets praising them for keeping it alive. 
</p>

Now they're looking to update their website and maybe get back to doing some print issues. Surely one of the most advanced tech communities in the world deserves a great website that covers poetry, and knows the history of the region? If you're a tech worker in the Bay Area, of course, here's a great way to build a bridge to the past community.

<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>


<p class="noindent">Personally, I'm partial to broadsides, and the $50 level offers a couple options. Of course, there's a tote (there's always a tote with book people), and you can even pre-purchase advertising for upcoming editions. </p>


<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">They've just gotten started, but it's a slow start so far. They're asking for $11,800, and don't even have $500. So, if you dig poetry, and you want to support a Bay Area institution, you should consider backing.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
