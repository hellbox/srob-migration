In [a long and thoughtful post](http://seattlemysteryblog.typepad.com/seattle_mystery/2017/09/why-the-seattle-mystery-bookshop-must-close.html), Seattle Mystery Bookshop owner JB Dickey explains why he's closing his bookstore at the end of this month. I'm sad the bookshop couldn't find a new owner, but I'm glad that Seattle had so many wonderful years with such a wonderful bookstore.
