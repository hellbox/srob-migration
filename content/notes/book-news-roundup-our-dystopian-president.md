 * Roxane Gay's upcoming book, *How to Be Heard*, was due to be published next year by Simon & Schuster. BuzzFeed reports that Gay has [pulled *How to Be Heard* from publication because](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jarrylee/roxane-gay-pulls-book-from-simon-schuster-in-response-to-mil?utm_term=.qnlWx9Lxx#.yrZOzqyzz) "I can’t in good conscience let them publish it while they also [publish [white supremacist] Milo [Yiannopoulos].](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/01/24/publisher-issues-unsatisfying-letter-to-justify-publishing-a-book-by-milo-yiannopoulos/) So I told my agent over the weekend to pull the project."

* Ten writers, including [*Seattle Review of Books* columnist Nisi Shawl](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/nisi-shawl/), are contributing [sepculative dystopian short stories about the Trump administration to *Slate*](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/slate_fare/2017/01/the_age_of_trump_feels_like_an_alternate_history_science_fiction_dystopia.html). The project was organized by Ben H. Winters, whose Last Policeman trilogy is really one of the most underappreciated sci-fi stories of the last five years. In his introduction to the series, Winters notes that since November 8th "we’ve all read 100 thinkpieces about what the next four years might hold, but fiction has a special power to clarify, galvanize, prophesy, and warn."

* Speaking of dystopian fiction and Donald Trump, Penguin just [had to publish 75,000 copies of *1984*](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/25/media/george-orwell-1984-best-seller/index.html) due to overwhelming demand.
 Welcome back to the bestseller list, George Orwell.
 
* A biography of Thomas Jefferson by Glenn Beck's favorite historian, the conservative evangelical zealot David Barton, [has been disavowed and discontinued by the book's publisher](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/08/09/158510648/publisher-pulls-controversial-thomas-jefferson-book-citing-loss-of-confidence). The book supposedly tried to make the case that Jefferson was an evangelical.

<blockquote>Since its initial publication, historians have debunked and raised concerns about numerous claims in Barton's book. In it, Barton calls Jefferson a "conventional Christian," claims the founding father started church services at the Capitol, and even though he owned more than 200 slaves, says Jefferson was a civil rights visionary..."When the concerns came in, from multiple people, and that had weight too, we were trying to sort things out," said Thomas Nelson Senior Vice President and Publisher Brian Hampton. "Were these matters of opinion? Were they differences of interpretation? But as we got into it, our conclusion was that the criticisms were correct. There were historical details — matters of fact, not matters of opinion, that were not supported at all."</blockquote>

* Chuck Palahniuk [admits that he came up with the term "special snowflake" in *Fight Club*](http://www.vulture.com/2017/01/palahniuk-snowflake-diss-came-from-fight-club.html), and he's not ashamed of it: "Every generation gets offended by different things but my friends who teach in high school tell me that their students are very easily offended," he says. I didn't think my opinion of Chuck Palahniuk could get any lower, but here we are.

* Writers, don't forget to [apply for a residency at Mineral School](http://mineral-school.org/residency/apply-and-faq/)! You say you don't know how to apply for a residency, or even, really, what a residency is? This Sunday, a number of local organizations that host residencies are putting on a panel to discuss residency-related issues. It's [at the library downtown, it's free, and it's at 2 pm](https://hugohouse.org/event/residencies-revealed/). Go get your questions answered. Really, who the hell wouldn't want to get out of town for a while?

* Melville House [appreciates the Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.mhpbooks.com/merriam-webster-will-not-abide-trumps-degradation-of-language/) for their anti-Trump stance.
