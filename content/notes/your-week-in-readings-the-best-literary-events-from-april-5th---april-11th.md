The Hugo House brings three writers and a musician together to produce new work on a theme. The final event of the 2016-2017 season is “Betrayal.” Readers include poet Anis Mojgani, celebrated slam poet Kaitlyn Greenidge, and poet Rick Barot, along with musician Maiah Manser.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday April 8th: *The Songs of Trees* Reading**</h5></p> 
So it turns out that trees are a lot weirder than we ever guessed. They communicate using bizarre fungus webs and they cultivate “bacterial communities” that serve all kinds of functions that we’re only just now learning about. In his newest book, David Haskell discusses the cutting edge of tree research, which should probably be known as “treesearch.”
 *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m.*

 <p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday April 9th: *Truth Be Bold* Reading**</h5></p> 
Julene Tripp Weaver is a Seattle poet who worked in AIDS services for over two decades. Subtitled *Serenading Life & Death in the Age of AIDS*, her latest collection continues the themes of her work.

Suzanne Morrison joins Seattle experimental writer Doug Nufer and prolific Seattle poet Megan Snyder-Camp as part of Hugo House’s divination-based reading series. Authors will answer audience questions using answers pulled from their texts. All three writers are great, but Nufer in particular could be a standout; he does lots of performance-based routines and should be especially devoted to the schtick.
