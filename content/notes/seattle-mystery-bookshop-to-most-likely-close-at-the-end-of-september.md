On the first day of August, [I reported that](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/08/01/anyone-want-to-buy-a-bookstore-seattle-mystery-bookshop-is-for-sale/) Pioneer Square mystery bookstore Seattle Mystery Bookshop was for sale. Last night, a number of Seattle-area book journalists received an email from Seattle Mystery Bookshop owner J.B. Dickey. "We've received no firm offers for the shop," Dickey says, "so it feels as if it is time to start winding things down."

"Most likely the end of the month will be it," Dickey explains. He wants everyone to know that the store is now hosting a big sale: 50 percent off all used books and 30 percent off all new books published before 2017. The bookshop is open from 10 am to 5 pm Monday through Saturday.

If no last-minute buyer comes through, hopefully some other Seattle-area bookstores will hire Seattle Mystery booksellers Fran and Amber, both of whom have years of bookselling experience and are voracious readers.

If you'd like to read more about Seattle Mystery Bookshop, we featured them in our Bookstore of the Month feature a couple years ago:

1. [Our September Bookstore of the Month is Seattle Mystery Bookshop](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/02/our-september-bookstore-of-the-month-is-seattle-mystery-bookshop/)
2. [The recommendation engine](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/09/the-recommendation-engine/)
3. [The staff of Seattle Mystery Bookshop recommends mysteries for people who think they hate mysteries](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/23/the-staff-of-seattle-mystery-bookshop-recommends-mysteries-for-people-who-think-they-hate-mysteries/)

Stop by the bookshop in the next few days. If you haven't visited in a while, your presence will be much appreciated. If you've never visited before, you'll want to spend some time in an underappreciated Seattle literary treasure before it goes away forever.
