Well, [this is pretty cool](http://www.openculture.com/2017/03/memoranda-haruki-murakamis-world-recreated-as-a-classic-adventure-video-game.html): 

<blockquote>...Vancouver-based studio Bit Byterz have chosen to pay elaborate tribute to Murakami by recreating his uncanny world with an adventure game called *Memoranda*... While not a direct adaptation of any one work of Murakami’s in particular, its locations, its characters, and above all its atmosphere come drawn from the same — to use a highly appropriate metaphor — well.</blockquote>
