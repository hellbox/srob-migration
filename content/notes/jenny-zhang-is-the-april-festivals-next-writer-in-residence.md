Yesterday, [the APRIL Festival announced](https://twitter.com/APRILfestSEA/status/664165747254362112) that Jenny Zhang will be the writer-in-residence of their next festival, which will take place the week of March 15—20, 2016. Zhang is the author, most recently, of the poetry collection [*Dear Jenny, We Are All Find*](http://www.octopusbooks.net/books/dear-jenny-we-are-all-find). Unfamiliar with her work? Try [this piece, which she published with *Poetry* magazine](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/250614):

<blockquote><p>When someone dies, we go searching for poetry. When a new chapter of life starts or ends — graduations, weddings, inaugurations, funerals — we insist on poetry. The occasion for poetry is always a grand one, leaving us little people with our little lives bereft of elegies and love poems.</p>

<p>But I want elegies while I’m still alive, I want rhapsodies though I’ve never seen Mount Olympus. I want ballads, I want ugly, grating sounds, I want repetition, I want white space, I want juxtaposition and metaphor and meditation and ALL CAPS and erasure and blank verse and sonnets and even center-aligned italicized poems that rhyme, and most of all — feelings.</p></blockquote>

She has [also written](http://www.rookiemag.com/2015/04/far-away-from-me/) extensively for the wonderful [*Rookie* magazine](http://www.rookiemag.com/2012/10/literally-the-best-thing-ever-m-i-a/). You'll have plenty of opportunities to get acquainted with Zhang's work this spring; the writer-in-residence at APRIL participates in a number of readings and also writes about the festival as it happens. It's a great way to get a writer acquainted with Seattle, and vice versa.
