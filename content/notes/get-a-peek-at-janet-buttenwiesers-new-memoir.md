<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1521243372974/GUTS_150.jpeg)</p>Published barely a month ago, local writer Janet Buttenwieser's memoir *GUTS* is perfectly in season. The story of her double loss — a significant hit to her health, the devastating loss of a friend — *GUTS* is about persistence, resilience, and renewal, a few things we all need right now. It's also about that most Seattle-y sport possible, the triathlon, and using physical endurance to endure emotional challenges. And it's a delight to read: clear, funny, self-reflective.

Hop over to [our sponsorship page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/) and check out the prologue, which Janet has generously shared with our readers this week. And join her **at Elliott Bay Books on March 31**, when she takes the stage with fellow Seattle7Writers Sorting Room Residents. We love when Seattle authors sponsor the site, and we're delighted to offer you a few pages of good reading to make your Monday brighter.
