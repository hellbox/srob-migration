One of the most famous translators in the world has died, [ABC News reports](http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/gregory-rabassa-renowned-translator-dead-94-39844639):

<blockquote>Rabassa was an essential gateway to the 1960s Latin American "boom," when such authors as Garcia Marquez, Cortazar and Mario Vargas Llosa became widely known internationally. He worked on the novel that helped start the boom, Cortazar's *Hopscotch*, for which Rabassa won a National Book Award for translation. He also worked on the novel which defined the boom, Garcia Marquez's *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, a monument of 20th century literature.</blockquote>
