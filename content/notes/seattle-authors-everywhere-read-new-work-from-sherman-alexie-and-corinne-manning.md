* Sherman Alexie's newest poem, "Hymn," was [published yesterday at Early Bird Books](https://earlybirdbooks.com/hymn-a-new-poem-by-sherman-alexie). It addresses President Trump directly:

<blockquote><p>Hey, Caveman, when are you going to evolve?</p>
<p>Are you still baffled by the way the earth revolves</p>

<p>Around the sun and not the other way around?</p>
<p>Are you terrified by the ever-shifting ground?</p></blockquote>

* Corinne Manning [has a new story over at *Joyland* this week](http://www.joylandmagazine.com/regions/pnw/wallaby), and it's weird and beautiful and full of greatness:

<blockquote>How does a wallaby play into this? Maybe you think I’d be excited to see a wallaby on a farm, because what could be normal about that? That’s not how I felt —  but all of this will make more sense later.</blockquote>
