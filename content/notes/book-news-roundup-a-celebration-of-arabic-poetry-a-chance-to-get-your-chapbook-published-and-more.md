* Two Sylvias Press's [annual chapbook contest is now open for submissions](http://twosylviaspress.com/chapbook-prize.html). The reading fee is $15, but the payoff is pretty great: the winner gets $400 and 20 copies of their finished chapbook. A poem by the winner of 2014's chapbook contest, Cecilia Woloch, was [recently featured in the *New York Times Magazine*](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/05/two-sylvias-press-poet-cecilia-woloch-in-the-new-york-times/).

* We've already suggested [two great events](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/02/15/your-week-in-readings-the-best-literary-events-from-february-15th-21st/) for tonight, but we just learned about this event happening in the Husky Union Building on the UW campus tonight, and we wanted you to know about it: [an evening of Arabic Poetry and Music](https://www.facebook.com/events/1969176933307912/), featuring poetry read in English and in Arabic by students. Some Seattle-area publications want you to think that Seattle isn't an international city of literature; that's just not true. This reading is just one great example of how Seattle's literary scene represents the whole world on a regular basis.

* At the Comics Reporter, [Dan Clowes has written a remembrance of Alvin Buenaventura](http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/he_was_as_loyal_a_friend_and_advocate_as_ill_ever_have_daniel_clowes_on_alv/), a prominent comics editor and publisher who [passed away last week](http://www.tcj.com/alvin-buenaventura-1976-2016-2/). Clowes writes, "he was inexplicable, the most singular human being I've ever met. There's nobody else in the world even remotely like him."

* Over at [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2016/02/15/putin-doesnt-need-to-censor-books-publishers-do-it-for-him/), Masha Gessen has written about the sad state of self-censorship in the Russian publishing industry.

* If you're an artist in need some inspiration, here's Seattle cartoonist/Short Run co-founder Kelly Froh's wonderful appearance on the Seattle Channel show *Art Zone with Nancy Guppy*.
