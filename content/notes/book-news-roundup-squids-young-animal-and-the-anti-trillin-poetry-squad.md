* [This wonderful appreciation](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/04/library-card/477162/) of the library card as an object unfortunately has a click-baity headline — "Is the Library Card Dying?" — but it [links to](http://www.travelinlibrarian.info/libcards/) some [beautiful](http://www.libraryhistorybuff.org/library-cards-vintage.htm) online [library card collections](http://librarycards.tripod.com/), and so it's worth your time.

* Last night at Emerald City Comicon, [DC Comics announced](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/04/07/toldja-gerard-ways-imprint-at-dc-comics-young-animal-and-it-will-stay-in-continuity-with-dc-rebirth/) that My Chemical Romance frontman Gerard Way will be overseeing a mature-readers imprint called Young Animal for the company. Titles include *Doom Patrol*, *Shade the Changing Girl*, and — this is maybe **the best title in the history of comics** — *Cave Carson Has a Cybernetic Eye*. 

* [Here's a headline](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/adult-colouring-book-craze-prompts-global-pencil-shortage-a6944401.html) that says it all: "Adult colouring book craze prompts global pencil shortage."

* Calvin Trillin's [obnoxious, poorly written, and racially insensitive poem in the *New Yorker*](http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/04/calvin-trillin-chinese-food-new-yorker-poem.html) was a bad situation and a black eye for the *New Yorker*'s much-vaunted editing process, but it has given rise to some very good response poetry. [Fatimah Asghar dedicates her poem](http://fatimahasghar.com/2016/04/07/to-the-white-men-who-fear-everything/) "To the White Men Who Fear Everything," to "you who reminded me no sidewalk or park/would ever be mine." [Craig Santos Perez wonders](https://www.facebook.com/notes/craig-santos-perez/have-they-run-out-of-franchises-yet-response-poem-to-calvin-trillin/10156824574155327), "Have they run out of franchises yet?/If they haven’t, our health has reason to fret." [Franny Choi asks](http://frannychoi.com/2016/04/06/have-they-run-out-of-white-poets-yet/) "Have They Run Out of White Poets Yet?" ("But then Ezra looked toward the East/to spice up his post-War can of meat...") [Talya Zax responds](ttp://forward.com/the-assimilator/338062/calvin-trillins-offensive-new-yorker-poem-a-response-in-verse/#ixzz45CP9fmMG), "Oh Trillin, our food-focused, sharply-phrased poet,/You’ve bungled, you’ve mis-hit, we’re sure that you know it." And Eddie Huang tweeted his response poem:
