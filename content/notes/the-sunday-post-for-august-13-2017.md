<p class="intro">Each week, the Sunday Post highlights a few articles good for slow consumption over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your pleasure). Settle in for a while; we saved you a seat. You can also <a href="http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/tags/the-sunday-post/" title="Sunday Post archives">look through the archives.</a></p>

<h5><a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2076/ready-player-one-movie-bad" title="‘Ready Player One’ is a terrible book and it will be a terrible movie - The Outline">"Ready Player One" is a terrible book and it will be a terrible movie</a></h5>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing like a solid takedown, especially of a book that, apparently, many people disliked but were afraid to confess to disliking until the movie trailer came out. We could go deep here on how nerd culture became cool, and whether we&#8217;ve hit peak nerd and are ready for a nerd backlash, but maybe let&#8217;s just take this at face value: <em>Ready Player One</em> had the references, but not the heart, of <em>Among Others</em>. One round was enough.</p>

<blockquote>
Nearly every one of *Ready Player One’s* faults is a direct result of Cline’s authorial narcissism. The writing process appears to have begun with the question: What if the entire world revolved around me, and the specific video games and movies I like? The rest was assembled around that essential core. Cline is far from the first author to write a self-insert wish fulfillment narrative, but he may be the first to write one this lazy and self-indulgent.

<h5><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/style/2017/08/07/chefs-say-a-dishwasher-can-make-or-break-a-restaurant-so-i-signed-up-for-a-shift/" title="At the heart of every restaurant - Washington Post">At the heart of every restaurant</a></h5>

<p>It&#8217;s a narrow line: spend a day in one of the lowest-paid and least-respected jobs in the food industry; write a shiny, self-deprecating-but-not-really, slice-of-life story; but don&#8217;t condescend or overwrite the reality of working your ass off for very little money in an environment where your colleagues may not even speak your language.</p>

<p>Food critic Tom Sietsema does a reasonable job with his recounting of a day as a dishwasher in a high-pressure restaurant kitchen, and there&#8217;s lot of interesting stuff about the job itself — and how the job is changing, thanks in part to successful chefs who got their start with their arms buried in suds. Here&#8217;s hoping equal salary goes along with the new titles and upgraded uniforms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The median annual wage for the 500,000 or so dishwashers in the United States is about $20,000, up only $4,000 or so from just over a decade ago. But a few restaurants, including the French Laundry, give cleaners the stature of sous chefs and extend titles that capture the broad range of responsibilities.</p>

<p>“We don’t call them dishwashers, but porters,” says Keller, who got his start washing dishes in his mother’s restaurant, the late Bay & Surf in Laurel, Md. “We give them the same respect we give anyone else in the restaurant.” Indeed, the only difference between the embroidered uniforms worn by his chefs and his porters are the latter’s short sleeves.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/10/opinion/sunday/13-exposures-frontrow.html" title="The Front Row - The New York Times">The Front Row</a></h5>

<p>This series of photographs of front-row fans, taken by documentary photographer Jessica Lehrman from the concert stage, are stellar: the human face (and body) burning with adrenaline, jubilation, awe, and fury. Look especially for the outliers in each image — the stone-faced security guard, the blue-lit skeptic, the man whose eyes drift from the star and meet the camera dead-on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The front-row fans are willing to be crushed against a metal barricade, hundreds, maybe thousands of people swaying and pulsing behind them, all connected to the same rhythm.</p>

<p>There are weepers, Instagrammers, those who need to live-stream all their experiences.</p>

<p>The fanatics know every single word.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a surprising amount of romance in <em>Bloomberg Businessweek&#8217;s</em> soul — witness this piece by Greg Milner on NYC&#8217;s subterranean mirror. We&#8217;ve mapped the surface of the planet down to the last ripple and bump; maybe the final frontier is under our feet.</p>

<blockquote>
New York City’s daunting infrastructural labyrinth is like the “Here be dragons” decorating ancient maps. Underneath the 6,000 miles of asphalt and concrete road lie thousands of miles of water, sewer, gas, telecommunications, and electrical infrastructure. And let’s not forget the 500 miles of underground subway tracks or Con Edison’s 100-mile steam delivery system. In its entirety, it’s known to no one.

<p>An ode to the <em>numero</em> by type designer Jonathan Hoefler, a geeky piece that philosophizes about punctuation, reminisces over a few lost forms (the <em>asterism</em>!), and winds its way to a detailed exploration of the main character (pun intended). The internet is swarming with this kind of &#8220;inside look&#8221; from industry experts; here&#8217;s an enjoyable example based on real knowledge and obvious love for the subject.</p>

<blockquote>
At its leading edge, punctuation is volcanically active, giving shape to concepts that move far faster than words. Anyone communicating today has seen #topics and #themes and #categories identified this way, using a symbol that was intuitively understood and replicated even before it was first called a hashtag in 2007. The symbol and its meaning are now universally recognized, transcending even the locality of language, but their use is scarcely a decade old — an astounding accomplishment for a bit of lexical fluff, when you consider that the newfangled OMG was first recorded in 1917 (and in a letter to Winston Churchill, no less.)
