*SRoB* tipper [Nick Hanover](https://twitter.com/Nick_Hanover/status/649818773860388864) alerted me to [this excellent Graphic Policy story by Janelle Asselin](http://graphicpolicy.com/2015/10/01/enough-is-enough-dark-horses-scott-allies-assaulting-behavior/) about former Dark Horse Comics editor-in-chief Scott Allie, alleging that Allie frequently engaged in "out of control behavior while drunk and biting." Yes, biting. As in, his nickname around the office was supposedly "**Bitey the Clown**." Allie was removed from his job this fall after he publicly assaulted two people at a convention, but rumor has it that Dark Horse Comics in specific, and the Portland comics scene in general, has been covering up for Allie for years. (And in fact, Allie **still works at Dark Horse**, under the title "executive senior editor.")

As Graphic Policy notes, there's [a long history of harassment and sexual assault in the comics industry](http://www.themarysue.com/harassment-in-comics-investigation/), and professionals have demonstrated a willingness to cover up for decades' worth of bad behavior. The silence is [starting to break](http://comicsalliance.com/sexual-harassment-women-comics-games-fear-way-of-life/), but that bad behavior is still [everywhere in the industry](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/09/16/calling-out-the-comic-book-super-villains/).

If you have experienced sexual harassment in the comics industry, [we want to hear your story](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/). It's bad enough that this behavior is considered typical in comics; it's downright disgusting to think that the Pacific Northwest has been home to this culture of silence for decades.
