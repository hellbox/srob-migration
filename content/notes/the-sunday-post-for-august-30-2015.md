<h5>[No Country for Young women](http://incisive.nu/2015/no-country/)</h5>

<a href="https://twitter.com/kissane/">Erin Kissane</a> on why she stopped reading fiction written by men, and movies with male protagonists: "I just got tired." 

<blockquote>
It’s not even that my politics quail at something I otherwise enjoy. I’m just stung and sad, and ashamed that I keep falling for the same trick. If a piece of fiction is made by and emotionally centered on men, chances are, it defaults to the belief that women are nothing but fuel. Doesn’t matter if I’m catching every reference and gleefully staying ahead of every jump. It will eventually declare that it’s not meant for me. Sometimes the women are missing, or just vacant; sometimes there’s a string of bloody bodies that look like mine. The point comes across.

<h5>[The Price of Diversity](http://therumpus.net/2015/08/the-price-of-diversity/)</h5>

Colleen Muir wonders, over at <a href="http://therumpus.net">the Rumpus</a>, if expensive writing conferences can really lay claim to promoting diversity? 

<blockquote>
On the Bread Loaf website, the director of the conference claims to “foster stimulating communities of diverse voices….” Yet I wonder if Bread Loaf, or any other fee-charging literary institution that waves the “we value diversity” flag, can genuinely make this claim. By charging writers such high fees, these literary institutions seal themselves off from what they claim to seek: diversity of talent, diversity of experience, diversity of voice.

<h5>[Literary Magazines for Socialists Funded by the CIA, Ranked](http://www.theawl.com/2015/08/literary-magazines-for-socialists-funded-by-the-cia-ranked)</h5>

The story of the journals that helped the CIA in their fight against communism. 

<blockquote>
“[I]n much of Europe in the 1950’s,” wrote Braden, “socialists, people who called themselves ‘left’—the very people whom many Americans thought no better than Communists—were about the only people who gave a damn about fighting Communism.”

<h5>[Why there are no taboos in Scandinavian children's books](http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/25/scandinavian-childrens-books-norway-ingelin-rossland-sex-swearing)</h5>

The Guardian published this piece by Norwegian writer Norwegian Ingelin Røssland on the openness in writing for kids in Scandinavia.

<blockquote>
<p>In Scandinavia there are no taboos when it comes to writing, even for children and young people. Books for teens exploring sexuality with explicit language are not censored. It’s so normal for us. There is nothing I can’t cover as a teen writer and I know my publisher would stand by me no matter what.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of examples to explain what I mean. The book Fittekvote by Axel Hellstenius and Morten Skårdal, about young girls in the military, won a literature prize in 2011. It would be called “Cunt Quota” if translated into English.</p>
