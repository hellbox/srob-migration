Gene Balk, the *Seattle Times*'s excellent "FYI Guy," [reported over the weekend](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/library-visits-drop-but-digital-use-soars/) that "Between 2011 and 2014, branch visits to Seattle Public Library declined by about 150,000 â€“ even as branch hours were added." Visits are especially down in the city's lowest-income neighborhoods, for unclear reasons. Circulation of digital materials, however, is way up. 

Could the lack of visits have to do with [SPL leadership's "anti-book" agenda](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/26/an-open-letter-to-the-seattle-public-library-board-of-trustees-about-spls-anti-book-agenda/)? Considering that many of Seattle's independent booksellers saw record sales during the same years that SPL's visits declined, an anti-book agenda probably isn't helping matters.
