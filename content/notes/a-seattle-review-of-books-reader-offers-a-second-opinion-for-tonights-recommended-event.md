We have already recommended the Literary Mixer at the Hideout as [tonight's must-attend book event](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/10/26/your-week-in-readings-the-best-events-from-october-26th-to-november-1st/), and for good reason: I've attended this event on multiple occasions and it's always a lot of fun. But we're always happy to hear a second opinion, especially when it comes from a trusted source, like *SRoB* reader Aaron Brethorst, [who writes in on Twitter](https://twitter.com/aaronbrethorst/status/658507335627771905):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/paulconstant">@paulconstant</a> another literary event of some note for this week: <a href="https://t.co/HUMEQKdQX4">https://t.co/HUMEQKdQX4</a>&#10;&#10;Here’s some coverage : <a href="https://t.co/wZlVQsfAYo">https://t.co/wZlVQsfAYo</a></p>&mdash; Aaron Brethorst (@aaronbrethorst) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronbrethorst/status/658507335627771905">October 26, 2015</a></blockquote>

The event Brethorst is linking to is an appearance by the debut novelist [Sigal Samuel](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=10&evyear=2015&eventid=2015071312233500&pre=20151017&pst=20151031), who will be reading from her novel *The Mystics of Mile End* at University Book Store. The [interview with the *Calgary Herald*](http://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/books/new-voices-of-fiction-freehand-books-launches-debut-works-from-rhonda-douglas-sigal-samuel) makes *Mile End* sound fascinating — a family story, a study of religion, a multi-perspective narrative. 

The fact is, any given night in Seattle will provide an overwhelming assortment of incredible literary events. We can't recommend them all. But we do love hearing from our readers — on Twitter, on Facebook, through email — and we take their recommendations seriously. If you're not feeling social enough for the Literary Mixer event tonight, you should absolutely make your way to University Book Store. Thanks, Aaron, for the tip!
