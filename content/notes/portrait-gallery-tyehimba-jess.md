<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday, March 4: Tyehimba Jess *Olio* Reading**</h5></p>
<p class="noindent">
This Sunday, Seattle Arts and Lectures is bringing Pulitzer Prize winning poet Jess to McCaw Hall. Jess is an artist who seems custom built for this moment in history. His poetry reflects the rich history of music of Black America - the blues, the gospel, the work songs, the jazz - and he’s rewriting the nation’s history to make more space for Black stories and songs. <br />
*McCaw Hall, 321 Mercer St, http://lectures.org, 7:30 pm, $20.<br /><br />
