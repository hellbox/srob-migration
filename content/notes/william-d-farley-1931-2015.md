[Seattle Mystery Bookshop has announced](http://seattlemysteryblog.typepad.com/seattle_mystery/2015/06/we-regret-to-inform-you.html) that their co-founder, [William D. Farley](http://seattlemysteryblog.typepad.com/seattle_mystery/2015/06/bill-farley-dec-12-1931-june-28-2015.html), passed away on Sunday, June 28th, "just three days short of the shopâ€™s 25th birthday." Our thoughts are with the staff of Seattle Mystery Bookshop at what must be a tremendously difficult time. What a legacy, though! The store he helped found is keeping a proud tradition of Pioneer Square bookshops alive.
