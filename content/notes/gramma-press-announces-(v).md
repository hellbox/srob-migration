This morning, the folks at Seattle's own Gramma Press announced that they'll be releasing a new book from poet Anastacia-Reneé (who [we published back when she was known as Anastacia Renée Tolbert](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/writers/anastacia-renee-tolbert/)) on July 1st. The collection, titled *(v.)*, is described this way:

<blockquote>Using a reimagined alphabet, Anastacia-Reneé sets about taking on everything from love to cancer, monsters, growing up, growing into our bodies, and the ways in which even our bodies are not our own. Her words define and redefine, explore hidden truths and expose the lies we are raised with.</blockquote>

This is a big release for Seattle publishing, and we can't wait to see it. You can [pre-order *(v.)* from Gramma directly](http://gramma.press/bookshop/v/), or you can pre-order it from your local independent bookstore.
