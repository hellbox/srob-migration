Jezebel [ran with the news first](https://jezebel.com/our-pal-lindy-west-is-dropping-two-more-books-1821773671): Seattle writer Lindy West is publishing two books, with one of the books dropping — incredibly — later this year. One book is a collection of film criticism, and the other promises "Lindy’s grand theory of America," which aims to explain our current cultural moment. See? Just when you thought the year was already ruined, you learn that there's something to look forward to!
