You already know that the Short Run small press & comix expo is [happening on Halloween](https://www.facebook.com/events/514625295380757/) this year. But they've just announced their schedule for the month of October, and there's some great stuff happening in the lead-in to the festival. First up, on October 8th, Short Run goes to the Capitol Hill artwalk with [an art show at Joe Bar](https://www.facebook.com/events/874259452654996/) featuring comics artists from Seattle, LA, Chicago, and Toronto. [On the 28th](https://www.facebook.com/events/787266681382495/), they'll be hosting special festival guests Charles Forsman and Melissa Mendes at the Capitol Hill branch of the library. On the 30th, they're having [a pre-festival funk at Fantagraphics Bookstore & Gallery in Georgetown](https://www.facebook.com/events/122990034717614/) with an art show featuring art from Forsman and Mendes and Jim Woodring, who is the most brilliant comics artist in Seattle. And on Halloween night, [they're hosting a costume party](https://www.facebook.com/events/1656217527988606/) with musical guests Your Heart Breaks and Mommy Long Legs, along with "a troupe of **bizarre papier-mâché monsters** by artist and musician Kelly Sorbel." 

Short Run is a celebration of Seattle's intentionally small and hand-made literary art scene, and their programming accentuates that aesthetic; they're accessible (most events are free) and energetic and fun. You should make sure to block out some time in your busy October to celebrate.
