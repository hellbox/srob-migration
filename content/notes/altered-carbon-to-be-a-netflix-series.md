Deadline [reports that](http://deadline.com/2016/01/altered-carbon-drama-series-laeta-kalogridis-netflix-skydance-1201684680/) Richard Morgan's sci-fi novel *Altered Carbon* is on track to become a Netflix series. 

*Altered Carbon* is a cyberpunk detective thriller in the style of William Gibson about digital immortality in a world 500 years from now. It's a spectacular, fun novel and you should give it a try. Adaptations are a fine thing — Netflix has a pretty good track record when it comes to their programming — but a year from now, when everybody is talking about *Altered Carbon*, you're going to want to read the original. Read it now so you're ahead of the curve and so that you don't have to buy the crappy tie-in cover with a photo of TV stars and a Netflix logo plastered on the front of the book. You've been warned.
