Emerald City Comicon has long since sold out, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy a number of (free) comics-centered celebrations around Seattle this weekend. Here are a few of the best-looking events for you to attend:

* Broadway's [Phoenix Comics is hosting a signing tonight from 5 to 7 pm](http://phoenixseattle.com/emerald-city-comic-con-schedule-events/) with Seattle author G. Willow Wilson and former Batgirl writer and *MotorCrush* writer/artist Babs Tarr.

* The fantastic free comics anthology *Thick as Thieves* is [hosting "Thievescon" Friday night at Nii Modo on Stone Way](https://www.facebook.com/events/2064285317150646/). All sorts of great local cartoonists will be in attendance including Marie Hausauer and Sarah Ramano Diehl. This looks to be a great independent Seattle-centric mini-con.

* Also on Friday night, [Outsider Comics and Geek Boutique in Fremont](https://www.facebook.com/events/916387338486326/) is hosting Seattle artist Tatiana Gill as part of their artwalk celebration.

* Saturday afternoon and evening, Outsider Comics is hosting a signing from [cartoonist Ben Fleuter](https://www.facebook.com/events/165730457558349/) and a signing from [Richard Rivera, who created something called Stabbity Bunny](https://www.facebook.com/events/546307009089908/).

* Yesterday [I interviewed Jaime Hernandez](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2018/02/28/for-jaime-hernandez-love-and-rockets-is-everything/), who will be doing a special signing at a party at the Fantagraphics Bookstore and Gallery in Georgetown on Saturday night with other cartoonists including Simon Hanselmann.

* And also on Saturday night, [Phoenix Comics is hosting a party](http://phoenixseattle.com/emerald-city-comic-con-schedule-events/) to celebrate the podcast *Jay + Miles X-Plain the X-Men*. 

* And if you'd rather buy comics than socialize, Comics Dungeon in Wallingford is [hosting a different sale for every day of the convention](https://www.facebook.com/events/202626210326420/). These sales, according to the Dungeon, have "one specific goal; to try to get you to try something new!"
