<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday, November 13th: *Jade City* and *This Mortal Coil* Reading **</h5></p>
Portland sci-fi author (and [*Seattle Review of Books* contributor](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/11/09/how-to-support-an-author-during-launch-a-guide-for-family-friends-and-fans/)) Fonda Lee comes to town with her newest novel, *Jade City*. It's about an island that has been protected by magic-users for generations. Lee brings her fellow Portland author Emily Suvada along with her; her latest is about a girl on a quest in a future where genetic engineering has become commonplace.

Tonight, the local science fiction community — more specifically, the local branch of the SFWA, or Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America—get together with a giant reading from three up-and-coming members of the local scene: Louise Marley, David Levine and Tina Connoly. You should go and find a new favorite. Also, maybe you should ask where the hell the extra “F” has gone in the “SFWA” acronym.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday, November 19th:  An Evening with David Sedaris**</h5></p>
Okay, look: David Sedaris tickets aren’t cheap, it’s true. They’re even less cheap now that most of the cheap seats have sold out for his Benaroya Hall appearance. But Sedaris is one of the only authors in the world who is continually worth it. He’s funny, he’s quick-witted, he loves performing his work for a room full of humans. You won’t regret the investment into this one.
*Benaroya Hall,  200 University St., 215-4747, http://seattlesymphony.org,  8 pm, $108. *
