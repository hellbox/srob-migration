_After Natasha Marin’s Red Lineage_

my name stumbles ups the stairs<br>
climbing towards grace, an ascending arc of red and gold

my mother's name mends shards back to glass<br>
melts them down with the heat of a thousand hearts,<br>
an aged and forgiving red

my father's name lives in a spoonful of shadows<br>
hungering for a cloud that will rain red

follow the seedlings and you will see<br>
my name become a little kite dancing in the wind,<br>
stand still under the cicadas’ summer song<br>
and see my mother's name strut<br>
to a living and slowly dying beat of red<br>
breathe in the fire’s flicker and my father’s name<br>
tending to the embers collapsing red.

I come from a people known for speaking without saying,<br>
for spitting the shine on their boots & stomping blackness<br>
into the heavens.
