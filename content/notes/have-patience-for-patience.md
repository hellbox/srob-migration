Yesterday, Seattle's own Fantagraphics Books [formally announced *Patience*](http://www.fantagraphics.com/patience), the new graphic novel by Dan Clowes. It's the biggest original comic he's ever produced, and the description sounds fantastic:

<blockquote>*Patience* is an indescribable psychedelic science-fiction love story, veering with uncanny precision from violent destruction to deeply personal tenderness in a way that is both quintessentially “Clowesian,” and utterly unique in the author’s body of work.</blockquote>

I've always been a Clowes fan, but I think his best work skims the surface of genre — *Ice Haven* was a cross-disciplinary mystery novel, *The Death Ray* was a superhero comic riff. The fact that he's flirting with sci-fi again, for the first time since *Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron*, is a big damn deal. *Patience* will be released in spring of next year.
