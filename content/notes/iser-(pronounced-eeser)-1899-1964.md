He died on August 15, 1964,<br>
during that hot hot summer.<br>
Mother sent his clothes<br>
down to Mississippi<br>
for the Freedom Riders<br>
or anybody else who needed them.<br>
I wish she would have left just one item out for me,<br>
something with his smell still on it.<br>
One of his shirts, maybe, with the stained collar<br>
or the worn down brown Oxfords<br>
that he always polished.<br>
I would have loved to have the fedora he wore all winter<br>
or a pair of white socks<br>
that he filled with Dr. Scholl's foot powder.<br>
She could have left me anything: a handkerchief,<br>
his bathing suit, an undershirt,<br>
or those thin black leather shoe laces<br>
he always broke.<br>
I would have liked the shaving brush I bought him<br>
or the striped tie he spilled soup on.<br>
Certainly his false teeth, the cup he put them in<br>
and the tall glass he sipped hot tea from.<br>
I would have liked his Russian-English dictionary.<br>
or his bifocals and his damn racing forms.<br>
She could have left me anything,<br>
even the belt he hit my brother with.
