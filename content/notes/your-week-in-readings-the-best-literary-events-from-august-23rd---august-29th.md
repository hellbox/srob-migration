 <p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday August 24th: *The Singing Earth* Reading**</h5></p>
Seattle musician Barrett Martin (Skin Yard, Screaming Trees, Mad Season) is about to publish a new book titled *The Singing Earth*, which comes with an overstuffed CD. It’s about his time traveling the world and exploring “14 musical regions.” Today, he appears in conversation with Seattle treasure DJ Kevin Cole.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday August 25th: Gender Odyssey**</h5></p> 
Now that we’ve got an orange hate machine as president, it’s more important than ever for cisgender folks to ally themselves with the trans community. Maybe the best way to do that is by attending Gender Odyssey, a long-running  (in its 16th year!) celebration of gender diversity. Authors and booksellers will be onhand to keep things nice and literary. 
*Washington State Convention Center,  705 Pike St., 694-5000, http://www.genderodyssey.org/seattle/. $150. All ages. 9 a.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday, August 26th: Seattle Urban Book Expo

See our Literary Event of the Week for more details.
*Washington Hall, 153 14th Ave, http://washingtonhall.org. Pay what you can. All ages. 1 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday August 27th: Two Poets**</h5></p> 
Ana-Maurine Lara, Ph.D., is the author, most recently, of *Kohnjehr Woman*, a narrative poetry book about race and the South. She’s also working on setting her original poetry to music and visual art. Today, she appears with poet Claudia F. Savage, who you may know better as one-half of the poetry performance duo Thick in the Throat, Honey. 
*Open Books, 2414 N. 45th St., 633-0811, http://openpoetrybooks.com. Free. All ages. 4:30 p.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday August 28th: Thrilling Tales**</h5></p> 
A couple times a month, librarians at the downtown library spend their lunchtimes reading a short story aloud to adults. Today’s reading is “The Great Pretender,” by Stanley Ellin. It’s about an old woman who is trying to protect her comely granddaughter from lascivious men who want to do terrible things to her.
*Seattle Public Library, 1000 4th Ave., 386-4636, http://spl.org. Free. All ages. 12:05 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday August 29th: *This Impossible Light* Reading**</h5></p> 
 Ravenna author Lily Myers celebrates the release of her newest book at her neighborhood bookstore. This Impossible Light is a young adult novel about a young woman struggling with an eating disorder. Perhaps the interesting thing about the book is that it’s written in verse, which is a trend in young adult books that I whole-heartedly endorse.
*Third Place Books Ravenna, 6504 20th Ave NE, 525-2347 http://thirdplacebooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *
