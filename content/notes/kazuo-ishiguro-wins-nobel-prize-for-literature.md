The British novelist is obviously a terrific choice for [the Nobel Prize](https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/915894552380215296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F10%2F05%2Fbooks%2Fnobel-prize-literature.html). People who like to read into the behind-the-scenes politics of prizes will likely be speculating that Ishiguro is a safe and uncontroversial choice after last year's polarizing selection of Bob Dylan.

But no matter what the reasoning behind the award, Ishiguro is a deserving winner. I know a lot of booksellers and librarians who consider him to be their favorite novelist. *The Remains of the Day* remains his greatest achievement, but his dystopian *Never Let Me Go* is perhaps his most haunting book — an elegy for the self, a story about identity and love and morality in an age where the technological hum in the background has slowly increased to deafening proportions.
