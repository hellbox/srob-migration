<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1456096014673/9781250067494.jpg)</p>**MONDAY** [Elliott Bay Book Company](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/mo-daviau)  kicks off your Week in Readings. **Mo Daviau** reads from her debut novel, which is titled *Every Anxious Wave*. Kirkus described it as  a ”punk-rock-time-travel story for the ages.” It’s about a person who finds a time-warp in his closet, which he then leases out to people so they can go back in time and watch their favorite bands play.


**TUESDAY** Beloved Seattle young adult author **Sean Beaudoin** debuts his new short story collection, *Welcome Thieves*, in a release party at [Hugo House](https://www.facebook.com/events/563533473806840/). Beaudoin promises “Music, cheap booze, a slideshow. Not the usual routine.” *Welcome Thieves* is his first book for adults.

**WEDNESDAY** It’s time for a big name: **Jon Krakauer** reads at [Town Hall](https://townhallseattle.org/event/jon-krakauer-with-ross-reynolds/). His latest, *Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town*, is about the sexual assault epidemic on college campuses around the country. Have you seen this video of Krakauer shutting down a questioner last year? It’s very worth your time:

**THURSDAY** Tonight, *Seattle Review of Books* cofounders **Martin McClellan and Paul Constant** will present our book club picks at the beautiful Bainbridge Island bookstore [Eagle Harbor Book Company](http://www.eagleharborbooks.com/event/book-group-night-paul-constant-and-martin-mcclellan). We invite you to come talk books with us.

But because we always offer additional events when there’s an *SRoB*-related happening, your **ALTERNATE THURSDAY** event is the very last [Cheap Beer and Prose](https://www.facebook.com/events/1171909166171010/) at the old Hugo House. It’s quite a lineup, too: **Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore, Hanna Brooks Olsen, Jessica Mooney, and Jason Schmidt**. This will be your last chance to buy $1 PBRs from the Hugo House bar. Make it count. (By “make it count,” I mean “drink until you start sobbing and clutching a column in the Hugo House while vowing to never let it go,” obviously.)

**FRIDAY** At the downtown branch of the [Seattle Public Library](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/damon-tweedy-md-seattle-public-library), **Dr. Damon Tweedy** will read from his new book, *Black Man in a White Coat: A Doctor’s Reflections on Race and Medicine*. We know that African-Americans [receive very poor health care](http://familiesusa.org/product/african-american-health-disparities-compared-to-non-hispanic-whites) in this country, but up until now, I’m not sure that anyone has really explored, in-depth, how people treat our African-American health care providers. This looks fascinating.

**SATURDAY** The [African-American Writers Alliance](http://www.aawa-seattle.com/) group reading has become a tradition [at Elliott Bay Book Company](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/african-american-writers-alliance-group-reading-0); the reading started over two decades ago, and it moved to Capitol Hill with the bookstore a few years back. Tonight’s readers: **Alliniece Andino, Margaret Barrie, Jaye Ware, Gaylloyd Sisson, Minnie Collins, Lola Peters, Monique Franklin, Santiago Vega, Helen Collier**, and event organizer **Georgia S. McDade**.

**SUNDAY** Celebrated tiny comic convention Exterminator City returns in a new location: Ballard’s [Push/Pull](https://www.facebook.com/events/149463042092490/), at the corner of Market & 24th. About two dozen Seattle cartoonists will be around to sell and discuss their very latest books.
