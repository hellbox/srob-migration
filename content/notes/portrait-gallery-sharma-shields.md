**Thursday June 15th: Writers & Poets of Washington State**</p>

<p class="noindent">
Western Washington poets Gary Lilley and Ann Tweedy team up with Spokane story author Erin Pringle and Spokane novelist Sharma Shields to bridge the divide and bring eastern and western Washington together at last. For one night, let’s pretend the mountain range, desert, and broken political discourse that separates us just doesn’t exist.<br/>*Hugo House, 1021 Columbia St., 322-7030, hugohouse.org. . Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*
