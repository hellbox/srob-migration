Sherman Alexie talks to Terese Marie Mailhot about the latest case of Native literary fraud [at the *LA Times*](http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-native-controversy-20170825-story,amp.html). (There's a long history of authors pretending to be Native, from [*The Education of Little Tree*](http://www.salon.com/2001/12/20/carter_6/) to [*Love and Consequences*](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2008/03/going_native.html).)
