<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday July 27: *Xinjiang and the Modern Chinese State* Reading**</h5></p> 
To hear Donald Trump tell it, China is supposedly that weird blob on the other side of the world that keeps screwing us with trade. For a more nuanced view, perhaps you should turn to Seattle native Justin Jacobs, who will debut his new book about the rise of China as a “national empire.”*University Book Store,  4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday July 28: Margin Shift**</h5></p>
Seattle’s Margin Shift poetry collective presents a night of young poets. Georgia writers Ginger Ko and Lindsay Tigue will read new work, but the real reason to turn out is to see Seattle writer Bernard Grant give one of his last readings in town before he pursues his PhD in literature at the University of Cincinnati.
