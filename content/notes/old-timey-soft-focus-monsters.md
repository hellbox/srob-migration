Long shot prairie<br>
Long shot wolf

Long shot girl<br>
Long shot deer

Long shot dog<br>
Close-up shot little monkey

My dear sweetheart,<br>
Where does the North begin?

Wolfang, Fang, Flash and Flame

My darling cotton wooly hotel<br>
A tiny house is expensive<br>
At the edge of the sea

What is happiness, Love?

My dear sweetheart&mdash;<br>
HUNGRY WOLVES SURROUND THE CAMP
