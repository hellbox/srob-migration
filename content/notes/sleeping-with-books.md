<blockquote>Opening this September is the Book and Bed, a new hotel located in Tokyo’s Ikebukuro neighborhood, that, according to Rocket News 24, literally “invites bibliophiles to sleep in the stacks.”</blockquote>

They can't promise privacy, but they can promise the opportunity to fall asleep while doing something you love. This is not your only opportunity to sleep in a bookstore: Abrams writes, "In Paris, if you’re [willing to volunteer time](http://shakespeareandcompany.com/51/shakespeare-and-company/55/volunteering-with-us), you can crash at Shakespeare & Co." 

So that's two ways to really make yourself at home in bookstores. Really, it's kind of surprising a bookstore bed & breakfast hasn't opened in Seattle yet, isn't it?
