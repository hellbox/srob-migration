<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday December 21st: *Take Back the Sky* Reading**</h5></p> 
Prolific Seattle sci-fi author Greg Bear delivers one of the last readings of the year at University Book Store. His latest novel is about a marooned group of space soldiers who await the arrival of a malevolent alien force they call “The Antagonists.” Bear’s book is a sci-fi military epic that travels across the universe to discover the secret of life.
*University Book Store,  4326 University Way N.E., 634-3400, http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday December 22nd: Punk Rock Flea Market**</h5></p> 
Those of you who have lived in Seattle long enough to remember the Value Village on 11th can probably automatically summon the store’s smell to mind — a dusky blend of creosote and loved objects. You can experience that smell one last time as the building hosts Punk Rock Flea Market before being destroyed in the new year. Find all kinds of treats from local vendors—including literary artists like erasure poet Jenessa Wright—for three days only, before it’s all torn down.  
 *Value Village Building, 1525 11th Ave, http://punkrockfleamarketseattle.com. $1. All ages. 4 p.m. * 
 
<h5>**Monday December 26th: Rainier Beach Library Tours**</h5></p> 
 Seattle, happily, is a city that votes to support its libraries. Today, the Rainier Beach branch of SPL is hosting half-hour tours all day long to show off all the renovations it has recently hosted. Learn about the library and check out the building’s new look. If you’re lucky, the space might still have that new library smell.
*Rainier Beach Public Library, 9125 Rainier Ave S., 386-1906, http://spl.org. Free. All ages. Noon. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday December 27th: *Feminist Fight Club* Reading**</h5></p>
Leaning in is so three years ago: Jessica Bennett says it’s time for working women to punch back. Her new book is a “guide to navigating subtle sexism at work, providing real-life career advice and humorous reinforcement for a new generation of professional women.” Let’s go crush the patriarchy.  *Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m. *
