Sad news: Jessa Crispin, founder of the popular book blog Bookslut, [announced on Twitter that she's shutting down the blog](https://twitter.com/thebookslut/status/707566403981717509) after 14 years. Bookslut was one of the very first book blogs I ever read, along with the late, lamented Bookninja, and it was hugely influential for me. (I sent a terrible pitch to them when I was just starting out and, thankfully, never received a response.) If you've never read Bookslut, I encourage you to [go check it out](http://bookslut.com/); all the issues are archived, providing a kind of literary time capsule as far back as [May of 2002](http://www.bookslut.com/2002_05.php).
