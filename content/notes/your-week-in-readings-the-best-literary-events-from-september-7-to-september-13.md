**MONDAY** [Celebrate Labor Day at Bumbershoot](http://bumbershoot.com/words_and_ideas#!programmation=artist$writing-the-northwest-with-timothy-egan-brian-doyle-and-jamie-ford/714), where the Words & Ideas Stage hosts a discussion between local authors Timothy Egan and Jamie Ford, with moderation from Portland Magazine editor Brian Doyle. Egan, of course, is a *New York Times* contributor and the author of some fantastic non-fiction history books. Ford wrote the Seattle-set novel *Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet.*

**TUESDAY** [Elliott Bay Book Company](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/anita-feng) hosts Anita Feng, a local poet and zen teacher who just published *Sid*, a contemporary retelling of *Siddhartha*.  Press materials say that “*Sid* teaches that the key to the story of the Buddha's life is that the story could be about any of us.”

</p>**WEDNESDAY** This is a big-name night with a big-name Seattle author. [Third Place Books](http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/event/lfp-your-life-harriet-chance-jonathan-evison) hosts Jonathan Evison, who will be reading from his new novel *This Is Your Life, Harriet Chance!* Evison, the author of the very good *All About Lulu* and the phenomenal *Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving* (which is being adapted into a movie starring Paul Rudd) is always trying new things in his fiction. *Harriet* is a novel about a nearly 80 year-old woman on an Alaskan cruise. At this reading, you should ask Evison how he researched the book.

**THURSDAY** When an event is titled [“Wave in the PNW: An Evening with Wave Books](http://hugohouse.org/event/wave-in-the-pnw-an-evening-with-wave-books/),” you’ve got our attention. Wave Books is one of the most ambitious publishers of poetry in America today, and tonight, they’re bringing five Pacific Northwest authors to town. Tonight’s readers are Alejandro de Acosta, Joshua Beckman, John Beer, Cedar Sigo, and Don Mee Choi, who is one of the best poets in Seattle right now. Seriously, this is a roster that’s gushing with talent — Beckman and Sigo have rocked my world in past readings — but I can’t wait to read Don Mee Choi’s forthcoming collection.

**FRIDAY** It’s time again for the [Hugo House’s Literary Series](http://hugohouse.org/event/lit-series-beating-a-dead-horse/), in which three authors and a local band produce new work based around a theme. Tonight’s readers are novelists Dinaw Mengestu and Alissa Nutting, along with wonderful local poet Sarah Galvin. The Foghorns will perform new songs. The theme — this year’s Literary Series is all about cliches — is “Beating a Dead Horse.” Somehow, I think this is the theme Sarah Galvin was born to write about.

**SATURDAY** Head on out to [the Bellevue branch of University Book Store](http://www2.bookstore.washington.edu/_events/events_cal.taf?evmonth=09&evyear=2015&eventid=2015060408541900&pre=20150903&pst=20150919_) for what sounds like a fascinating book. Here’s the pitch: “Over a decade ago, W. Ernest Freud, the only one of Sigmund Freud's grandchildren to become a psychoanalyst, asked Bellevue psychologist Daniel Benveniste to write his biography.” Tonight, Benveniste debuts the biography, which is titled *The Interwoven Lives of Sigmund, Anna and W. Ernest Freud: Three Generations of Psychoanalysis*. Imagine the kind of apple that family tree must’ve produced.

**SUNDAY** [Capitol Hill rum bar Rumba](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/event/adam-rakunas-rumba) is an unconventional place to hold a reading, which means we’re all for it. Tonight, author Adam Rakunas presents his novel *Windswept*, which is a science fiction story about a labor organizer who wants to open a rum distillery. Yes, and it all happens in space. You just can’t resist that kind of a premise.
