Washington State Poet Laureate Tod Marshall [announced](http://wapoetlaureate.org/2016/03/18/call-for-submissions-washington-129/) that he's looking for new poems [(PDF)](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwashingtonpoetlaureate.files.wordpress.com%2F2014%2F11%2Fwashington-129-call-for-submissions-print.pdf) from Washington poets for a book titled *Washington 129*. Unsurprisingly, he'll publish one poem from 129 different poets â€” that's one poet for each year of Washington's statehood. The gist of the announcement:

<blockquote>*Washington 129* is accepting submissions until January 31, 2017. Previously published poems will not be considered. Please submit no more than three poems as a single Microsoft Word attachment or as the body of an email to submissions@humanities.org.</blockquote>
