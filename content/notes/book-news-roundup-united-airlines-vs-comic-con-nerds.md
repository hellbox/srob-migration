* The host of the computer science book club at Ada's Technical Books has [written a great Medium post](https://medium.com/@TiltedListener/why-you-should-start-a-computer-science-book-club-baf6c440c0c9) about why you should start (or join) a computer science book club.

* In what may be one of the greatest instances of architectural trollery in history, someone [built a Parthenon out of banned books](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/a-parthenon-of-banned-books-built-at-a-former-book-burning-site) on the site where Nazis burned books in 1933.

* [This person](http://www.thebookseller.com/futurebook/ebook-dead-format-595431) thinks e-books are on the way to being a "dead format."

* [This person](https://the-digital-reader.com/2017/07/24/ebooks-dead-format/) disagrees.

* The next book from George R.R. Martin will [arrive in 2018](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/07/george-r-r-martin-winds-of-winter-update-2018). Supposedly.

* After San Diego Comic Con, United Airlines tried to ban comics in checked bags. It [didn't go well](https://consumerist.com/2017/07/24/united-airlines-says-it-misunderstood-tsa-about-non-existent-ban-on-comic-books/).

<blockquote>“While TSA is recommending that customers keep their comic books in their carry-on bags, there are no restrictions on packing them in checked luggage,” reads the statement. “We misunderstood TSA’s instructions and regret any inconvenience this may have caused our customers.”</blockquote>

* Speaking of comics, a [glowing corporate profile of the CEO of Amazon's ComiXology platform at *Forbes*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2017/07/13/inside-amazons-plan-to-put-comics-on-every-screen) does yield one interesting piece of information: the number of women reading digital comics on ComiXology "has **doubled** since 2011." Angry white men are going to have to realize at some point that this playground isn't just for them anymore.
