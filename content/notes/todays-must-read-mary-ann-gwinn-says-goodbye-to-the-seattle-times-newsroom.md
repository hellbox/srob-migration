You have to read [Mary Ann Gwinn's final column in her role as the *Seattle Times* books editor](http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/closing-the-book-on-34-years-in-the-seattle-times-newsroom/). It's a grand and generous tour of the last 34 years in Seattle literary history. I'm not going to pull a single quote here, because you should read the whole thing. (Full disclosure: I choked up a little at the shoutout to the *Seattle Review of Books*.) 

But before we get too somber, let's note that Gwinn is not disappearing: she will contribute columns to the *Times*, she's writing about books for other outlets, and she'll [continue to co-host *Well Read* on KCTS](http://kcts9.org/programs/well-read). But a three-and-a-half decade long career as a book reviewer is a remarkable achievement, and it deserves our recognition. 

Thanks for everything, Mary Ann. Here's to many more years of talking about books.
