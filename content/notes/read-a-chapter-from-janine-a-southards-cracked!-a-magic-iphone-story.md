Our sincerest thanks to Janine A. Southard for sponsoring _The Seattle Review of Books_ this week. 

In the hilarious, and well-loved *Cracked! A Magic iPhone Story* (four stars on Amazon!), the award-winning Southard (a Seattle denizen) shows you how the geeks of Seattle live, provides a running and often-hilarious social commentary on todayâ€™s world, and reminds you that, so long as you have friends, you are never alone.

Help support The *Seattle Review of Books* by [reading her excerpt](/sponsorships/) and ordering the novel if you like what you read.
