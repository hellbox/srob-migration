<p class="intro">Each week, [Christine Larsen](http://christinelarsen.com) creates a portrait of a new author for us. Have any favorites you’d love to see immortalized? [Let us know](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about)</p>

To celebrate the second release of her busy summer, *Forget It* from Santa Cruz publisher Black Radish, Anastacia-Reneé will be joined on Tuesday the 25th at Elliott Bay Book Company by three stellar Seattle-area authors: poet Jane Wong, memoirist Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore, and poet-slash-civil-rights-attorney Shankar Narayan. She’s not only generous with the spotlight, but Anastacia-Reneé is perfectly willing to give time and exposure to other authors who complement her work. Other writers would balk at giving three dynamos some of her stagetime. Anastacia-Reneé knows that every stage is big enough to share.

*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, [www.elliottbaybook.com](http://elliottbaybook.com). Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*
