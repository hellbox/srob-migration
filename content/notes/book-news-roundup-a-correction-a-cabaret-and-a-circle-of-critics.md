* First, let's begin with a correction. In this week's [Event of the Week column](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2018/03/12/literary-event-of-the-week-dock-street-salon-at-phinney-books/), I credited the Dock Street Salon solely to Dock Street Press publisher Dane Bahr. In fact, Bahr co-hosts the salon with Seattle author and publisher [Heather Jacobs](http://www.bigfictionmagazine.com/). And this week's edition of the Salon was entirely curated and coordinated by Jacobs, not Bahr. I sincerely apologize to Jacobs for getting that wrong, and I've amended the listing to give her proper credit.

* [Here's a last-minute event](http://www.therendezvous.rocks/event/bell-battery-cabaret-now-2018-03-18/) you ought to know about: The Bell & Battery Cabaret is a variety show that's happening at the Rendezvous at 8 pm tonight, and twice on both Saturday and Sunday. Performers include Markeith Wiley and Ade, and the show also features Seattle poet Shin Yu Pai, who says she will "read a commissioned poem about nightclub singer Pat Suzuki and also sing a song." You've got five chances to see this one, so get to it.

* Did you [see the Pew poll about American reading habits](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/08/nearly-one-in-five-americans-now-listen-to-audiobooks/)? Turns out one in five Americans regularly listen to audio books, almost 75 percent of Americans read a book last year, and print books aren't going anywhere:

<blockquote>Some 39% of Americans say they read only print books, while 29% read in these digital formats and also read print books. Just 7% of Americans say they only read books in digital formats and have not read any print books in the past 12 months.</blockquote>

* This year's [National Book Critics Circle Award](https://themillions.com/2018/03/2017-national-book-critics-circle-award-winners.html) winners include *Improvement* by Joan Silber, *Whereas* by Layli Long Soldier, and *Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder* by Caroline Fraser.
