A winner, a swinger, a ringer.<br>
A looker, a loser, an up-on-his-lucker.<br>
Someone looser, someone tighter,<br>
definitely not an all-nighter. A whiner,<br>
wine-swiller, someone to entertain<br>
the fundraiser chicken dinner.<br>
Someone with handlers, another with baggage,<br>
one with the umbrellas, another with the rain.<br>
Different faces, symmetrical and un-.<br>
A smoker, a non-, a joker, a song.<br>
Two lungs, a heart, a head, a leg, a leg.<br>
The drink, the dregs. The beggar, the begged.<br>
Definitely an all-nighter, all-dayer, a swayer<br>
of opinions, a bringer down of hammers.<br>
An issuer of kiboshes, a knitter of knishes,<br>
a whetter of knives, a weather of whether<br>
or nots. A forget-me-not, a violet,<br>
a violin, a cowbell. Someone old,<br>
someone new, someone borrowed,<br>
someone blue. Someone happy,<br>
someone researching happiness,<br>
someone who was happy once.<br>
Someone false. Someone true.<br>
A failure, a failure<br>
who has found success<br>
from failure, a feeler,<br>
a feeling, the flu.<br>
Sugar, salt, and acid.<br>
Lake Crescent, Lake Angry, Lake Placid.<br>
A shouter, a touter, an outer.<br>
An innie, a sharpie, a shark.<br>
What you want. Who you want.<br>
Who wants you. The ditty,<br>
the lark, the dark.
