One of Seattle's oldest comics shops is set to close. [Zanadu Comics posted on Facebook yesterday](https://www.facebook.com/zanaducomics/posts/1438853082878733):

<blockquote>The good guys donâ€™t always win. Unfortunately, our world is harsher than that of comic books and after 42 years of battling in the trenches of comic book retail, Zanadu Comics will be closing its doors at the end of January 2018. Believe us when we say that this decision was not made lightly. There are hundreds of reasons we could list, but the truth is that the money coming in does not equal the money going out.</blockquote>

[Go read the whole post](https://www.facebook.com/zanaducomics/posts/1438853082878733). Zanadu has been selling comics since 1975. After it closes, the only downtown comics store will be Golden Age Collectables in the Pike Place Market, which could be [the oldest comics shop in the world](https://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2017/10/23/golden-age-collectibles-might-be-the-oldest-comic-store-in-the-world).
