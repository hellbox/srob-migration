<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday March 1st: Reading Through It: *Strangers in Their Own Land* **</h5></p> 
The *Seattle Review of Books* and the *Seattle Weekly* present our monthly current-events book club.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Alternate Wednesday March 1st: Ben Fountain**</h5></p> 
Okay, so Ang Lee’s film adaptation of Ben Fountain’s novel *Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk* was a total bust. But that doesn’t detract from the book: with his debut novel, Fountain stabbed into the heart of American self-regard. Come celebrate one of the brightest young talents to appear on the scene in the past decade.

On the long list of journalists who screwed up during the 2016 presidential election, you won’t find Matt Taibbi’s name. Unlike most pundits, the *Rolling Stone* writer never discounted the rise of Bernie Sanders or the victory of Donald Trump. Tonight, Taibbi joins progressive activist Joel Berg in conversation.

Art critic Matthew Kangas’s newest book, *Paul Havas*, focuses on the life, letters, and work of an underrated Seattle-area artist Paul Havas.

Come learn about an important figure in the Northwest art tradition.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday March 7th: Artificial Emotional Intelligence**</h5></p>
