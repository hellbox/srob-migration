* Shakespeare's First Folio is now at the [Seattle Public Library](http://www.spl.org/library-collection/first-folio). ([At the *Seattle Times*](http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/shakespeares-first-folio-is-receiving-visitors-at-the-seattle-public-library/), Mary Ann Gwinn wrote about the opening festivities for the Folio.) You can find a full calendar of Folio-related events — including readings, movies, plays, music and more — [on SPL's website](http://www.spl.org/library-collection/first-folio/calendar), and you can [get tickets to visit the Folio here](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2486090).

* You can now [sign up for Hugo House's spring quarter classes](https://hugohouse.org/classes/course-catalog/?hh_course_genre=&hh_course_type=&hh_course_term=1164) online.

* Prince is [publishing a memoir](http://www.vogue.com/13418497/prince-memoir-announcement/). We are all very excited about this, but we hope that he will use the letter "I" rather than his usual pictograph of an eye, because that will get very tiring very fast. Same thing with "to" and "2."

* Good news! The online editorial cartoon magazine The Nib is returning! They've got [an open call for non-fiction and satirical cartoons up right now](https://medium.com/@MattBors/pitch-your-comics-to-the-nib-a8f0dde2bf3f#.f9ze7htx4).

* Speaking of online magazines, have you seen the new poetry magazine [*Public Pool*](http://www.publicpool.org/)? They've got [a very impressive array of young, diverse poets](http://www.publicpool.org/).

* Roxane Gay's powerful debut novel *The Untamed State* is [going to be a movie](http://deadline.com/2016/03/gugu-mbatha-raw-to-star-gina-prince-bythewood-to-helm-an-untamed-state-1201724469/). Gay is co-writing the screenplay.
