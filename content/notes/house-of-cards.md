When I was a kid, I loved George R. R. Martin's superhero anthology fiction series Wild Cards.  It's hard to get superheroes right in prose, but Martin's dark and involved universe just felt perfect. (The comics adaptation of the books, as I recall, was terrible.) If you're going on vacation later this month and you like sci-fi anthologies, grab a couple Wild Cards volumes before you go.

Well, now that *Game of Thrones* has taken over the universe, [a *Wild Cards* TV series is in the works](http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/universal-cable-productions-nabs-the-rights-to-george-r-r-martins-wild-cards-series/123452). After watching the debacle that is *Suicide Squad* last week — seriously, they should show that movie in film editing classes to demonstrate how *not* to edit a film — I'm feeling pretty burned out on live-action superheroes. But I think *Wild Cards* is a decent enough mix of realism, intelligence, and inventiveness to work on tv.
