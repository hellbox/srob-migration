<h5>Reading around: new titles on the crime fiction scene</h5>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1498107276425/MagpieMurders%20HC%20C.JPG)</p>

<p class="noindent">Canny novelist (the Alex Rider series, the new Sherlock Holmes thrillers) and television writer (_Midsomer_ _Murders_, _Foyle’s War_) Anthony Horowitz is in his literary element in _Magpie Murders_ (Harper). An excellent two-fer when it comes to crime fiction – the tome features a beautifully-composed Golden Age mystery written by an author whose editor finds herself with a more contemporary mystery on her hands &mdash; Horowitz’s clever take on the vintage English mystery genre as well as the often-fraught world of book publishing is one of this year’s most entertaining reads.</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1498107289565/FINAL%20Here%20and%20Gone%20jacket%20by%20Haylen%20Beck.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">The excellent Stuart Neville’s new foray under his Haylen Beck moniker, _Here and Gone_ (Crown), is about as chilling as psychological suspense novels get. Audra Kinney is trying to free herself and her two kids from an abusive husband, when, in frighteningly rapid succession, she’s pulled over by a cop on a lonely stretch of highway and separated from her kids. The story that transpires digs into some of the darkest corners not just of the Dark Web, but of what sometimes constitutes human motivation. Not as nuanced as Neville’s Belfast-based novels, but a truly propulsive page-turner nevertheless.</p>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1498107304680/Love%20Like%20Blood%20by%20Mark%20Billingham.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">Don’t let Mark Billingham’s stand-up-comedian aspect of his professional life fool you: his crime novels don’t shy away from being pitch-black as well as witty. _Love Like Blood_ (Atlantic), features the welcome return of Billingham’s astute and empathetic London-based detective Tom Thorne, here assisting colleague Nicola Tanner with what seems to be a series of honor killings. As he works to crack the horrific cases with Tanner, Thorne’s on top form, nimbly juggling work, happy domesticity, and forensic details down the pub with best buddy, police pathologist and self-proclaimed “devil’s avocado” Phil Hendricks. </p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1498107314180/DeathOnNantucket.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">_Death on Nantucket_ by Francine Mathews (Soho) starts off all cosy-like – atmospheric island, a wedding in the works – but quickly veers off into more terrifying territory that includes, in no particular order, dysfunctional family dynamics to the max, poisoned beverages, a semi-mummified corpse, and even a temporary venture into America’s war in Southeast Asia. It’s been 19 years since the last Merry Folger mystery, but the island detective returns in fine fettle here.</p>

<h5>The Quintessential Interview: Jason Pinter</h5>

<p class="image-left">![](/webhook-uploads/1498107327734/TheCastle_cover.jpg)</p>

<p class="noindent">Polis Books publisher by day, Jason Pinter has an authorial track record of his own: in his latest novel, [**_The Castle_**](https://www.amazon.com/Castle-Ripped-Headlines-Thriller-ebook/dp/B072FHXLKN/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1495849692&sr=8-1), Everyman Remy Stanton blocks a crime-in-action on the Upper East Side, and finds himself in the best books of New York businessman Rawson Griggs, who bears  amusing similarities to a Manhattan mogul currently based in the White House. Thriller and satire in one, Hoboken-based Pinter’s novel manages to be both escapist and finger-on-the-pulse-spot-on, as well as a fun, fierce ode to the Greater New York Area. </p> 

<p class="noindent">**What or who are your top five writing inspirations?**</p>

<p class="noindent">
I’ve always had a love for epic tales of good versus evil – as a kid, you could always find me buried in a thousand-page novel by Terry Brooks, Piers Anthony, or Stephen King. </p>

I’m fascinated by what drives good people to do bad things. 

The notion that every villain is the hero of his or her own story. (Wouldn’t it be fantastic to read some classic books told from the villain’s perspective? I bet Pennywise has an amazing tale to tell). 

Perhaps the thing that most gets my juices flowing is reading a good book. If I’m reading a terrific book, I often feel inspired: the muse comes and taps me on the shoulder, and the little devil tells me to put the book down and go write.

<p class="noindent">**Top five places to write?**</p>

<p class="noindent">
My desk at home. It’s cluttered with papers and files and I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

Bwè cafe in Hoboken. It’s a homey coffee shop a few blocks from my house. If you walk in there at any time of day, the place is filled with people working on laptops. Great coffee and stable WiFi.

Bookstores. Chain or indie, as long as they have seating, coffee, and WiFi. I love taking a 15-minute break and just walking around, browsing the aisles. 

Airplanes. Nothing helps pass a cross-country flight than hitting that groove and knocking out a dozen pages before you land.

<p class="noindent">**Top five favorite authors?**</p>

<p class="noindent">
Top five writes who inspired me as a child: Terry Brooks, Piers Anthony, Stephen King, Brian Jacques, and Clive Barker (I was a massive horror hound).</p>

As an adult: Dennis Lehane, Zadie Smith, James Ellroy, Charlie Huston, Dave Barry (Who couldn't use a little more booger humor in their life?)

<p class="noindent">**Top five tunes to write to?**</p>

<p class="noindent">I love writing to movie soundtracks; I have a hard time focusing on writing while lyrics are also playing. My favorite soundtracks to write to are _The Social Network_, _The Bourne Supremacy_, and _Drive_. I’m also a huge Ramin Djawadi fan, so I also love the _Game of Thrones_ soundtrack and, weirdly enough, the _Fright Night_ remake soundtrack. I’m also obsessed with the _Hamilton_ soundtrack (who isn’t?) though that’s more to give me a boost of inspiration to get _back_ to writing. And sometimes hard rock/heavy metal. Hey, I grew up in the 80s and 90s, I’m a Metallica/GN’R guy.</p>

<p class="noindent">**Top five hometown spots?**</p>

<p class="noindent">
I’m a New Yorker, born and bred, but now live across the Hudson in Hoboken, so here are the spot that make me want to hop on the Path train at any given moment:</p>

<a href="http://www.strandbooks.com" title="Strand Book Store: New, Used, Rare and Out-of-Print Books">The Strand</a>. Wandering the stacks at The Strand is cheaper and _way _more effective than therapy for me. I collect old first editions of books that have inspired me at some point, and a good portion of my collection has been purchased there.

<a href="https://www.mysteriousbookshop.com" title="The Mysterious Bookshop">The Mysterious Bookshop</a>, my home-away-from-home. 

<a href="http://www.brandylibrary.com" title="Brandy Library">The Brandy Library.</a> My wife took me here for my birthday one year, and if you’re a liquor connoisseur, then this is your sanctuary. Their drink menu is—I kid you not—several hundred pages long. We went here soon after the _Breaking Bad_ finale, so I just had to try a Dimple Pinch (note: it was gooooood)

<a href="http://www.comedycellar.com" title="Comedy Cellar | Comedy Club | NYC">The Comedy Cellar</a>: the best stand-up comedy joint in the country. Don’t bother to fight me on this. The club is literally in a cellar: it’s small and cramped, but this is where the greats go to test their stuff. On separate occasions, I’ve seen Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld show up unannounced just to practice new material (I also saw John Mayer do stand-up here, but that’s a whole different story).

<a href="http://carbonenewyork.com" title="CARBONE | Major Food Group | New York Restaurant">Carbone</a>: if you watch _Master of None_, you’ll recognize it as the restaurant Dev and Jeff eat at (it’s Jeff’s third dinner of the night). The best meatballs I’ve ever had in my life.
