<p class="prose-poem">**Step 1.** Show up on Inauguration Night<br>
Leave your pretensions at home this time,<br>
you will not be saving anyone here.<br>
There is a surge of black-clad bodies that will quickly take your stubborn<br>
_Berniecrat_ and _I’m With Her_ shirts out of fashion.<br>
You have a bleeding heart<br>
pinned to your sleeve by a safety pin</p>

<p class="prose-poem">Huffington Post told you to wear it<br>
Your well-meaning aunt told you,<br>
with the force of a whole rich neighborhood association’s facebook group behind her, that this<br>
tiny piece of metal<br>
will save the poor and wretched<br>
welcome them to your teeming shore &mdash;</p>

<p class="prose-poem">No.<br>
Don’t get caught up in pretensions.</p>

<p class="prose-poem">**Step 2.** When you see notorious white supremacist Richard Spencer being interviewed by the news,<br>
make sure your safety pin is visible.<br>
Wait for a poor, victimized Person of Color to approach you for help.<br>
You’ll grow so tired<br>
of waiting for an opportunity to show off your allyship you might learn something.</p>

<p class="prose-poem">**Step 3.** Here is the hard part<br>
While Richard Spencer is talking about the Pepe the Frog pin on his lapel<br>
his face<br>
will be interviewed by a **fist** instead.<br>
He, all bigotry, hair gel, and bloated pride<br>
stumbles from the well-placed blow, lands on the concrete a couple yards away</p>

<p class="prose-poem">Suddenly, the assailant’s fist is Lady Liberty’s torch, blazing a trail for us to march on.</p>
 
<p class="prose-poem">Suddenly<br>
we are **all** the fist<br>
humiliating white supremacy at its own inauguration.</p>

<p class="prose-poem">In the universe of this small victory,<br>
no one is president.<br>
No cop tear gasses a restaurant without resistance<br>
and bigotry<br>
bleeds from biting its own eager tongue again.<br>
Someone punches Richard Spencer and hope blooms a tangible thing in me.<br>
Hundreds of miles away<br>
I breathe just a little easier></p>

<p class="prose-poem">so before you yell,<br>
“just sign a change.org petition!”</p>

<p class="prose-poem">Think of how long we have been waiting.<br>
How you say,<br>
“we’ll survive these four years”<br>
as if we<br>
have not been trying to survive for centuries.</p>

<p class="prose-poem">Think of you love watching us swallow when we want to spit.<br>
Pressure hosing a panther and reprimanding her when she bites.</p>

<p class="prose-poem">Think of how you pulled the nine inch knife out six inches, stared at the wound, and called the bleeding progress.<br>
Think of where you were<br>
when an islamophobe tore off her hijab on the bus,<br>
and you did not do anything.<br>
Think of the community centers that shook with death threats<br>
and you<br>
did not do anything<br>
Think of the cops that gunned a black kid<br>
into memory and you<br>
did not<br>
do<br>
anything.</p>

<p class="prose-poem">**Step 4.**<br>
I will not come to you for help.<br>
Take off the safety pin.<br>
Know that fascism does not arrive with a name tag,it arrives as your friend.<br>
It arrives as Richard Spencer, well-manicured and well-behaved, speaking poison into cameras spinning it acceptable.</p>

<p class="prose-poem">Do not allow this by any means necessary<br>
Leave your pretensions at home.<br>
Practice<br>
making<br>
a fist.</p>

<p class="poem-footer">Azura Tyabji is our February Poet in Residence.<br><br>
