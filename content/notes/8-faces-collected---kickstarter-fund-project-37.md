<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_8 Faces: Collected_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elliotjaystocks/8-faces-collected?ref=category_recommended). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Elliot Jay Stocks](http://8faces.com/).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
We’re re-designing and re-editing all 8 issues of typography magazine 8 Faces — and adding new content — to make a huge, hardback book.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	8 Faces was an absolutely beautiful typography magazine. It wasn't cheap, but it was luxuriously printed and gorgeously designed. 
</p>

<p>
	Issues sold out quickly, and are impossible to find now. The creators are Kickstarting a new collected edition that takes all the content from all eight issues of the magazine, updates the layout, and puts them in one huge book. Score.
</p>


<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	Because you love typography. Because you love reading articles and interviews about design, and a beautiful 500 page book about typography makes you feel a little funny in your stomach, like you're in love. Because you're missing an issue (or eight) from your collection. Because you want to support indie creators doing cool projects offline, that you can hold in your hands, and that will live in your library for the rest of your life. 
	</p>


<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	30% funded with 28 days to go. Good trajectory, but let's see if we can help them out and spread the world. Every bit helps.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
