I'd encourage you to read this whole Twitter thread by Shannon Hale about authors who are horrible in public:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s a little story I&#39;ve told often in private but never in public. Several years ago I was the emcee of a high profile author event.</p>&mdash; Shannon Hale (@haleshannon) <a href="https://twitter.com/haleshannon/status/975787592825290752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2018</a></blockquote>

For the love of God, authors: everyone has a megaphone now. If you can't act like a decent human being because it's the right thing to do, you should at least act like a decent human being because the world will very likely learn about your behavior.
