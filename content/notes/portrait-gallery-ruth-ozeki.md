<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday, February 23: “Meditation for Writers” with Ruth Ozeki**</h5></p>
<p class="noindent">
This Friday at Washington Hall, author and Zen Buddhist priest Ruth Ozeki will speak on the theme “Meditation for Writers,” and it is a talk that only she could give. She’ll help writers gain the focus that modern technology seeks to steal from them, and the perspective that only a true sense of timelessness can offer.<br /><br />


*Washington Hall, 153 14th Ave, http://washingtonhall.org, 8 pm, $15.*
