<p class="noindent">**What's the project this week**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[_Codex Valtierra - Relaunch_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/521277495/codex-valtierra-relaunch?ref=category_recommended). We've put $20 in as a non-reward backer</p>

<p class="noindent">**Who is the Creator**?</p>

<p class="noindent">[Emmanuel Valtierra](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Emmanuel-Valtierra-Illustrator/804139329608066).</p>

<p class="noindent">**What do they have to say about the project**?</p>

<p class="noindent"><blockquote>
What if the Aztecs won the war against the Spaniards? A wonderful illustrated tale for kids and adults.
</blockquote></p>

<p class="noindent">**What caught your eye**?</p>
	
<p class="noindent">
In the grand tradition of the modern revenge narrative, comes the mother of all revenge narratives: what if the Aztecs had chased away the Spaniards? Illustrator Emmanuel Valtierra has reimagined Aztec stories using the visual storytelling techniques from the Aztec codecs. 
</p>

If you like to wonder what the Americas may have been like if the European invaders had been kept at bay &mdash; and who hasn't? &mdash; then I guess the question I have for you is: did you imagine it told entirely in pictures? 


<p class="noindent">**Why should I back it**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
The work looks gorgeous. It's a great idea, that looks well executed, and the ask is completely reasonable.
</p>


<p class="noindent">**How's the project doing**?</p>

<p class="noindent">
	36 days to go and 56% funded! That's a good trajectory â€” get your money in.
</p>

<p class="noindent">**Do they have a video**?</p>
