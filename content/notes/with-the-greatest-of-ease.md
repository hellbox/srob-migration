<p class="noindent">We've all dreamed about making the big leap: a new job, a new country, a new life. Molly McCord did all three, leaving a stable but unsatisfying career in Seattle to start over in Paris, a city she'd never seen. She shares the story in *The Art of Trapeze* â€” part memoir, part instruction manual for choosing a different path. As the title implies, trusting yourself as your feet leave the platform is the hardest and most necessary part. Read a sample chapter, provided just for _Seattle Review of Books_ readers, and enjoy McCord's trademark blend of humor, honesty, and self-reflection. If you like it (and you will), the book is twenty percent off through August at her site.
