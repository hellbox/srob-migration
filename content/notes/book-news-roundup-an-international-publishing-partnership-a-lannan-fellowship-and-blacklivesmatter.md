* Yesterday, [Fantagraphics Books announced](http://fantagraphics.com/flog/breakdown/) that they're entering into a partnership with young British comics publisher Breakdown Press. The Seattle-based publisher is bringing some (not all) of the very best of Breakdown's output to American bookstores and comics shops, starting with [Anna Haifisch's book *The Artist*](http://www.breakdownpress.com/store/the-artist) and [Hayashi Seiichi's book *Red Red Rocks and Other Stories 1967-1970*](http://www.breakdownpress.com/store/red-red-rock-and-other-stories-1967-1970). Breakdown's catalog [looks very cool](http://www.breakdownpress.com/store/) — a mix of international artists working in a variety of styles.

* Congratulations to Seattle poet Don Mee Choi, who won a [Lannan Literary Fellowship for Poetry](http://www.lannan.org/literary/detail/don-mee-choi/). We loved her most recent book of poetry, [*Hardly War*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/the-adverbs-of-war/).

* Did you know that the Seattle Public Library has a searchable collection of titles that have been tagged #BlackLivesMatter? [It's true](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&t=tag&search_category=tag&q=blacklivesmatter). Thank you for doing this, SPL. By making these books available and tagged, you're helping Seattle's African-American community and its allies find much-needed resources. This is terrific.

* Donald Trump's election has [spurred a number of Americans to buy subscriptions to magazines and newspapers](http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/11/after-trumps-election-news-organizations-see-a-bump-in-subscriptions-and-donations/). This does not count as Making America Great Again; Trump doesn't get credit for revitalizing print media by being a big asshole.

* Today in depressing legal battles, Dr. Seuss's estate is [suing a writer and artist](http://geeknation.com/dr-seuss-estate-sues-star-trek-writer-over-comic-book/) for their *Star Trek*-themed Seuss parody book.

<blockquote>Dr. Seuss Enterprises, the California company that owns the rights to all the works of author and illustrator Theodor S. Geisel – better known as Dr. Seuss – have sued a Connecticut-based comic book company, ComicMix, as well as the company’s president for copyright and trademark infringement, and unfair competition. It’s all over a book called *Oh, the Places You’ll Boldly Go!* written by classic Star Trek scribe David Gerrold and illustrated by Ty Templeton.</blockquote>
