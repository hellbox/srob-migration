Independent booksellers and librarians made Jeannette Walls's 2005 coming-of-age memoir *The Glass Castle* into a global bestseller. While *Castle* was obviously well-written and funny and heartbreaking, it's hard to imagine the book breaking through into the mainstream without the passionate support of librarians and booksellers who understood the value of a meaningful coming-of-age story.

The [film adaptation of *Glass Castle* (starring Brie Larson, Woody Harrelson, and Naomi Watts) is coming out on Friday, August 11th](http://www.theglasscastle.movie/), and because the literary community made the book such a huge success, the good folks at film PR firm Allied Integrated Marketing wanted to make sure that bookish folks got to see it first. So we're partnering with them to give away some free VIP ticket prize packs to the Seattle premiere of *Glass Castle*, which screens next Tuesday evening at Pacific Place.

All you have to do to enter is visit [our Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/seattlereviewof) or our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/seattlereviewof/) and follow the directions there. If you retweet the *Glass Castle* tweet or comment on the *Glass Castle* Facebook post by 5 p.m. today (August 1st), you're entered to win. That's it! We'll notify the winners by tomorrow evening.
