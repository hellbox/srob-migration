<h5>**Friday, November 24th: Shabazz Palaces with Special Guest Gillian Gaar**</h5>
<p class="noindent">Seattle hip-hop geniuses Shabazz Palaces are branching out and becoming multimedia moguls. Tonight, they debut their first-ever comic book, Quazarz vs. The Jealous Machines, with a signing and DJ set in Georgetown’s fabulous Fantagraphics Bookstore and Gallery. Expect some neat things to happen when comics and hip-hop combine. Along for the ride is Seattle-area music writer Gillian Gaar, who will be signing her new book *Hendrix: The Illustrated Story*.</p>
