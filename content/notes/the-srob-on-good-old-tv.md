If you were watching NBC News last week you have may have noticed a segment about the Amazon bookstore opening in Seattle. In that clip, you may have seen our own Paul Constant giving his (our, really) opinion on the matter. 

But we didn’t know until today ([despite nice friends letting us know](https://twitter.com/aaronbrethorst/status/661756686344949761)) that the video played on national NBC News, not just [King5](http://www.king5.com). Today we [uncovered the video in question](http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/amazon-bookstore-blends-tech-brick-mortar-charm-n456861), and are offering it for you here, in the least timely way possible, so that you, like us, can cheer when you see our website appear on that master of all media, big television. Or hiss, if you're a hate reader (welcome to the site!).
