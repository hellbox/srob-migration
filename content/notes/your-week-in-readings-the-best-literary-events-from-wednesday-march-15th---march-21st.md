The West Seattle reading series celebrates the Ides of March with a very timely theme.

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday March 18th: *Exit West* Reading **</h5></p> 
Mohsin Hamid writes novels about the world as it is now. His books are structurally adventurous and tuned to provocative issues like immigration, racism, and the War on Terror. His latest novel is about a young couple finding love in a world overrun with homeless refugees and fearful xenophobes.

 <p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday March 19th: *The Rules Do Not Apply* Reading**</h5></p> 
*New Yorker* author Ariel Levy’s new memoir is about losing everything—a child, a husband, a successful career—and finding out what happens next. This book has received praise from all corners for its stark portrayal of grief and survival. She’ll be in conversation with Seattle memoirist Claire Dederer. 
 *Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, http://elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 6 p.m.* 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday March 20th: *Free Women, Free Men* Reading **</h5></p> 
 In the 1990s, Camille Paglia was kind of a big deal: she was a controversial feminist who seemingly never turned down an opportunity to speak publicly. She fell out of favor after the turn of the millennium, but as the ancient Chinese proverb goes, if you live long enough, you get to see yourself critically reappraised. 
*Seattle Public Library, 1000 4th Ave., 386-4636, http://spl.org. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. * 


<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday March 21st: *Lovecraft Country* and *Everfair* Reading**</h5></p> 
The Seattle-based authors of two of last year’s best novels—not just sci-fi novels, mind you, but novels in general—share a stage at Elliott Bay tonight. Matt Ruff celebrates the recent paperback release of his novel-in-stories, *Lovecraft Country*. Nisi Shawl’s steampunk alternate history *Everfair* is still in hardcover, but it is worth every penny.
