Look, I don't wanna get into a fight over Bob Dylan. But Bob Dylan is inarguably world-famous. Books and countless articles have been written about Bob Dylan's genius. Bob Dylan has won an obscene number of awards. He's [made a lot of money](http://gothamist.com/2014/01/30/videos_a_brief_history_of_bob_dylan.php). 

And I'm just saying: **Joan Didion still does not have a Nobel Prize in Literature**. Or Claudia Rankine. Or Marilynne Robinson. If this was the year for an American to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, seeing one of those names in all the news reports would have made my morning a much happier one.
