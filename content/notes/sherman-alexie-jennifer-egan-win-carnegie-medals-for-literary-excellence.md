Congratulations are due to Seattle author Sherman Alexie, who won a [Carnegie Medal](http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/carnegieadult) for his amazing memoir, [*You Don't Have to Say You Love Me*](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/stitch-by-stitch-by-broken-stitch/). *Love Me* is the non-fiction winner, and Jennifer Egan's acclaimed *Manhattan Beach* won the fiction prize this year. If you haven't read either of these books, you should fix that right away.
