* Just a reminder that we are very excited about [the *Seattle Review of Books* showcase happening at Bumbershoot this Sunday at 7:30 pm](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/26/the-seattle-review-of-books-is-coming-to-bumbershoot/). We'll be presenting poets EJ Koh and Robert Lashley onstage with poet, novelist, short story author, and all-around Seattle literary lion Sherman Alexie. We hope to see you there.

* Wallingford's wonderful Open Books [closed yesterday and will remain closed for about two weeks](http://www.openpoetrybooks.com/) because it's "transition time," which means  old owner [John Marshall](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/04/open-books-owner-john-marshall-is-in-the-closing-stages-of-selling-the-shop-to-a-new-owner/) will be officially handing over ownership to [Billie Swift](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/04/27/introducing-billie-swift-the-new-owner-of-open-books/). Expect the store to reopen in mid-September under Swift's command.

* You have two days to [submit to the *Tahoma Literary Review*'s eighth issue](https://tahomaliteraryreview.com/2016/08/30/last-two-days-to-submit-for-our-8th-issue/).

* So happy that Ursula Le Guin is [getting her own Library of America edition](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/books/ursula-le-guin-has-earned-a-rare-honor-just-dont-call-her-a-sci-fi-writer.html?_r=0) but it's a little sad that she prickles so much at the mention of genre: "'I don’t want to be reduced to being "the sci-fi writer." People are always trying to push me off the literary scene, and to hell with it,'" she tells the *New York Times*. This is very likely a generational thing — Vonnegut hated being referred to as a sci-fi writer, too — and in the long run, it's not a big deal. Still, it's a shame that Le Guin can't take pleasure in raising the bar for an entire genre.

* Amazon's newest brick-and-mortar Amazon Books store [will open in Chicago in 2017](http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/amazon-to-open-a-bookstore-in-chicago/124275).

* Since [the internet is currently (and rightly) aghast](http://www.themarysue.com/can-you-just-not/) at a dumb blog's "how to talk to a woman wearing headphones" article, let's just take this opportunity to remind men how to talk to women reading books in public. Step one: **don't**. Every step after that: **seriously, don't**. This has been a public service announcement from the *Seattle Review of Books*.
