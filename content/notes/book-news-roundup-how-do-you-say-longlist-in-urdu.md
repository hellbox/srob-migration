* [Shelf Awareness reports](http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2721#m31965) that local book distributor Partners/West is closing. The Renton office will stop delivering books on April 1st. This is a huge bummer; it means that local bookstores in need of rush titles will have to rely on [Ingram](http://www.ingramcontent.com/), the largest book distributor in the country. Though most bookstores try to order direct from publishers whenever possible because the discounts are better, distributors are the best way for bookstores to get books in a hurry. Booksellers turn to distributors when a book breaks big on NPR, for instance, or when a customer needs a special order. As an indie bookstore customer this news probably won't affect you directly, but it does mean that local bookstores have one less option for getting books, which could create larger problems down the line. As [comic book stores have learned](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/12/24/thursday-comics-hangover-bringing-the-fire/), having one major distributor for your product can be problematic.

* Looking for a good new translated book to read? The Best Translated Book Award 2016 longlist for fiction [has been announced](http://translationista.net/2016/03/best-translated-book-award-2016-fiction-longlist.html). At 25 books long, it's a bit excessive, but there's something to be said for having a nice long shopping list at the ready for the next time you go book shopping.

* Eight thousand library jobs in the United Kingdom have disappeared over the last six years, [reports the BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-35707956). This is terrible news for British library-goers, but speaking selfishly, it's a relief to read that this isn't America for once.

* The *Comics Journal* published [a long interview with *Underworld* artist Kaz](http://www.tcj.com/kaz-interview-by-peter-bagge-for-tcj/), by Seattle cartoonist Peter Bagge. My favorite bit?
