I first heard of *Vice* magazine while [working at Borders](https://medium.com/@paulconstant/books-without-borders-b8ccb08b5b8a#.m31okopsy). An achingly hip young man came into the store — it was the late nineties and my memory is foggy, but he was probably dressed like a rave had collided with a grunge music festival — and asked me if we carried *Vice*. I said I didn't know what *Vice* was. He explained that it was a cool free magazine distributed around major American cities, and that new issues disappeared as quickly as they arrived. Without really thinking, I asked why, if it was such a cool magazine, he went looking for it in a corporate chain bookstore. The bluntness of the question didn't really strike me until it had already left my mouth, and we stared at each other awkwardly for a second before he left the store.

For the last decade, *Vice* has been trying to become an international media brand, to varying levels of success. Their website certainly gets a lot of clicks — though, honestly, all sorts of garbage news sites get a lot of clicks simply because they're on good terms with Facebook. But we're now seeing that [*Vice*'s new TV channel, which was supposed to bring "millennials back to TV," is failing miserably](http://www.thewrap.com/viceland-low-ratings-shane-smith-ae-disney-vice-media/). 

<blockquote>...Viceland is only drawing an average primetime audience of 45,000 in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen data obtained by the *Wall Street Journal*. Worse, the median viewer age is 40, meaning that fully half of its total audience is far outside the “millennial” audience, widely considered to be 18-34.</blockquote>

*Vice*'s quest for mass-media success confuses the hell out of me. The whole point of *Vice* has always been exclusivity: from the beginning, it's been targeted to a mostly male, mostly white audience of terrible people who live in cool neighborhoods. (Please note that *Vice* has often published the work of very good writers and very good cartoonists; I'm not saying everything in *Vice* has always been awful and I'm not saying that everyone who's read *Vice* is a terrible person. I'm referring, here, to the institutional strategy behind *Vice*.) 

It is not a publication that has ever been intended for everyone. It's a publication for people — again, mostly white, mostly male, mostly affluent — who desperately care about how cool they are. Thankfully, that's always going to be a slender slice of the population. For *Vice* to gain traction with a wider slice of the market, a [Disney-sized portion of the market](http://www.wsj.com/articles/disney-and-vice-a-storybook-romance-1471963909), say, it's going to have to radically change its model, and once it changes its model, it won't be *Vice* anymore. It'll be CNN for Assholes. 

And frankly, there's already a CNN for Assholes and [one of *Vice*'s founding members already works there](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/15/gavin-mcinnes-women-happier-at-home_n_7289048.html). Does the world really need a Fox News: Coachella Edition? The fact is, *Vice*'s brand of "edgy" hipster racism and "just-playing" sexism is outdated, and its anti-mass-market edge is a corporate pose. It's aging. It's not millennial, it belongs to those asshole white dudes who were in their twenties when *Vice* was ascendent. It's middle-aged now, and the company is flexing its sagging muscles just as hard as a 50-year-old middle manager who buys a shiny new sports car. 

Finally, it's biologically impossible for me to write about *Vice* without posting this video of sainted *New  York Times* reporter David Carr tearing *Vice*'s current CEO, Shane Smith,  to shreds in the middle of an interview:
