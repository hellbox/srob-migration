 <p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday June 22nd: Resisting Trump's Shock Doctrine**</h5></p>
Naomi Klein reads from her latest book, *No Is Not Enough*, and also will talk extemporaneously about whatever special hellish thing our president decides to do this week. Who can predict what that will be? Maybe he'll give citizenship to cockroaches and declare war against Luxembourg. Why not?
*The Neptune, 1412 18th Ave, 1-800-745-3000.  http://www.stgpresents.org/tickets/eventdetail/3522/-/resisting-trump-s-shock-doctrine-an-evening-with-naomi-klein $23.49. All ages. 7:30 p.m.*
 
<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday June 23rd: Spotlight**</h5></p> 
Group readings tend to die down around this time of year, which is a shame, because few things are better on a hot summer night than a brisk night of literary events. Tonight’s readers are Josh Potter, poet Sharon Nyree Williams, and *Word Lit Zine* publisher Jekeva Phillips, along with an open mic in which readers get three minutes apiece.
*Theater Schmeater, 2125 3rd Ave, schmee.org. $14. All ages. 7:30 p.m*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday June 24th: June Write-In **</h5></p> 
June Write-In 
This is the second in an ongoing series of write-ins in which authors gather to talk about the importance of free speech and democracy in a functioning America. Readers include afrose fatima ahmed, Catherine Bull, and Anca Szilágyi. Be prepared to write about and discuss what it is you love about your country.
*Hugo House, 1021 Columbia St., 322-7030, hugohouse.org. Free. All ages. 10 a.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday June 25th: *Says You!* **</h5></p> 
Did you know that Town Hall Seattle is about to close for a yearlong renovation? It’s true! One of the best readings venues in the city will be shuttered, improved, and reopened. This is your last chance to catch NPR game show *Says You!* in this venue for at least one year. 
*Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, townhallseattle.org. $32.50. All ages. 7:30 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday June 26th: *The America Syndrome* Reading
**</h5></p> 
Betsy Hartmann’s latest book examines how American thought tends to be overly obsessed with the apocalypse. Is the idea of the end of the world intrinsic to the American ideal? Why do Americans spend so much time thinking about Armageddon? Is there any way to turn our national psyche around? 
*Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave., 652-4255, http://townhallseattle.org. $5. All ages. 7:30 p.m. * 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Tuesday June 27th: Who Belongs?**</h5></p> 
Dr. Sapna Cheryan leads a discussion about women in science, why it’s taking so long for female representation to catch up in science — particularly computer science. Also discussed: why computer science is so thick with sexist and derogatory language. How do women catch up in this traditionally male-dominated field? That’s what tonight is all about.
*Ada’s  Technical Books, 425 15th Ave, 322-1058, http://seattletechnicalbooks.com, $5, 21+.*
