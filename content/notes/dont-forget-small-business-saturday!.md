Tomorrow, of course, is Thanksgiving. The day after that is Black Friday. Don't shop anywhere on Black Friday; it's a mess out there. But on Saturday, you should go shop at your favorite small business, because it's Small Business Saturday. Small businesses are essential to local economies; [studies have shown](https://www.amiba.net/resources/multiplier-effect/) that while only 14 cents of every dollar spent at a chain recirculate through the local economy, nearly 50 cents of every dollar spent at a small business stays in the local economy. 

Your favorite small businesses are probably bookstores. And a lot of local bookstores are celebrating Small Business Saturday with special events and deals. Here are some of the treasures you'll find:

* Bainbridge Island's [Eagle Harbor Book Company](http://www.eagleharborbooks.com/) is hosting authors, hot cider, and prize giveaways.

* [Edmonds Bookshop](http://www.edmondsbookshop.com/) is offering cookies, autographed books, and "a gift of Jefferson flyer with purchase," with the caveat that "you'll have to come in to see what that is." 

* [Magnolia's Bookshop](http://www.magnoliasbookstore.com/) is hosting author Molly Hashimoto, along with free treats and tote bags.

* The [Neverending Bookshop in Bothell](http://seattle.carpediem.cd/events/5202340-small-business-saturday-at-tnebs-at-the-neverending-bookshop/) is hosting trivia all day and a reading from local fantasy author James D. Macon.
