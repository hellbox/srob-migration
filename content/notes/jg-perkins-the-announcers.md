This week's sponsor is [Chatwin Books](http://www.chatwinbooks.com/), and we're <a href="/sponsorships/">featuring the introduction and a full chapter</a> from _The Announcers_, by J.G Perkins.

This is the first volume in Perkins' 19-volume _Darkness Before Mourning_, one of the largest series of serious fiction ever created by a single author. We're featuring the Introduction, and chapter 15, for you to read in their entirety. 


<blockquote>
For those who shared it, the American Dream was wonderful. I awakened from part of that dream early and watched, in one way or another, much of the rest of the country follow over several decades. Some are still asleep. Like many of the awakened, I found that my dream had elements of a nightmare. And while I treasure truth above all else, I envy those who are still dreaming.

<a href="/sponsorships/">Read both selections</a>, and help us in our fight to make <a href="http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2015/08/05/help-us-make-internet-advertisements-100-percent-less-terrible/">internet advertising something worth looking forward to</a>.
