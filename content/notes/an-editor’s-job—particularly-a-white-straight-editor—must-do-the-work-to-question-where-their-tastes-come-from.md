The excellent local literary magazine *The James Franco Review*, which has a blind submission policy intended to "publish works of prose and poetry as if we were all James Franco, as if our work was already worthy of an editor’s attention," published [an editorial today](http://thejamesfrancoreview.com/2015/07/30/editorial-dear-white-editors/) that all white editors — [ourselves included!](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/about/) — should read and take to heart.
