<p class="noindent"><h5>**Wednesday May 3rd: Reading Through It: *The Righteous Mind***</h5></p> 
I hope you’ll join us for our book club examining the causes and effects of Donald Trump’s presidency. It’s been a total delight so far, full of brainy, passionate discussion. Tonight, we’ll discuss *The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion*. No purchase necessary; just come ready to talk and listen.
*Third Place Books Seward Park, 5041 Wilson Ave S, 474-2200, http://thirdplacebooks.com. Free. All ages. 7 p.m. * 

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Alternate Wednesday May 3rd: *Priestdaddy* Reading**</h5></p> 
Since the Seattle Review of Books is a co-sponsor of the book club, allow us to suggest another event so you don’t accuse us of favoritism. Poet Patricia Lockwood reads from her delightful memoir *Priestdaddy* tonight, and it's a big damn deal. [As I said in my review](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/reviews/youll-laugh-youll-cry/), the prose is gorgeous and the story will leave you laughing and crying — sometimes both at the same time. 
*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m. * 
 
 <p class="noindent"><h5>**Thursday May 4th: *Unwarranted* Reading**</h5></p>
In his new book, Barry Friedman, a law professor at New York University, examines the crisis in modern policing. Why do cops now dress like they’re SEAL Team 6 and drive around in tanks? How did the balance of power between police and the people they’re sworn to protect get so…well…unbalanced?
*UW Law School, Room 133, 634-3400, http://ubookstore.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m.*
 
<p class="noindent"><h5>**Friday May 5th: *Writers on Writers* Release Party**</h5></p> 
The editors behind Seattle’s own *PageBoy Magazine* debuts their brand-new book, an anthology of writing about writers. Local writers Sarah Koenig, Jeanine Walker, Amber Nelson, and Paul Nelson will read their writer-centric pieces in what should be a fun celebration of the art of putting words on paper in some sort of order.

*Vermillion Art Gallery and Bar, 1508 11th Ave., 709-9797, vermillionseattle.com. Free. 21+. 7 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Saturday May 6th: Free Comic Book Day**</h5></p> 
Every comic shop in the region will be giving away free comics all day today (while supplies last.) Your friendly neighborhood comics shop will likely be celebrating with sales, appearances by local comics creators, and more. If you haven’t yet been, this is also a great opportunity to visit Fremont’s Outsider Comics & Geek Boutique, Seattle’s newest comic shop.
*Various locations, https://www.freecomicbookday.com. Free. All ages. 10 a.m.*

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Sunday May 7th: *Lines of Flight* Reading**</h5></p> 
Julie Salverson’s book, subtitled *An Atomic Memoir*, is about a group of indigenous peoples in Ontario who sent a delegation to Japan to apologize for their complicity in war. Seems the uranium to build the first two American atomic bombs was mined from their land, and they felt honor-bound to go make amends.  
*Elliott Bay Book Company, 1521 10th Ave, 624-6600, elliottbaybook.com . Free. All ages. 7 p.m. *

<p class="noindent"><h5>**Monday May 8th: *Mozart’s Starling* Reading**</h5></p> 
 This is a bizarre story: one day when Mozart was out shopping, he came across a little starling who was singing one of his concertos. He took the bird on as a pet and then kinda collaborated with it for the next three years. Birdwatcher Lyanda Lynn Haupt will discuss her belief that starlings are seriously underrated creatures.
