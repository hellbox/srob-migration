Let me tell you about the place I come from, the ragged-road Texas<br>
where every gas station means hot breakfast tacos wrapped in foil,<br>
and every summer means brisket cooked so slow it falls apart,<br>
because everything worth doing is worth doing slow<br>
unless it’s driving, or sex,<br>
both of which we do young and fast until someone stops us,<br>
except for me, who starts driving late and starts dating never<br>
because the only boys who talk to me do it to get good<br>
at talking to girls. This is how I learn to fall in love<br>
with people who will never want me back.

Where I come from there is Spanglish at every table.<br>
We talk about my grandma’s diabetes and my grandpa’s<br>
Little Debbies, the Evil Eye and the ways you can get it,<br>
my uncle’s ex-wife lighting candles in their closet<br>
to make him love her back. It is not a place for being right;<br>
it’s for walking together over parking lots rainbowed with oilslick,<br>
for the good music, and palm trees, and air that is so heavy.<br>
We grow up playing war in woods trying to strangle us,<br>
no diplomacy allowed. The peaches on the peach trees<br>
can’t be eaten and the open grass is littered with cutting burrs,<br>
which is how we learn nature is a trap and crank the AC.<br>
You are amazed that anything can bloom here.

We grow up drought-season baths in two inches of water,<br>
battered by the metronome of parch and storm.<br>
We grow up penance for our bodies and the things they need;<br>
there is never moisture when we want it but always poison ivy,<br>
a sky looming with tragedy. This is how we learn to fall in love<br>
with things that will never love us back.

In the Texas I come from, my Nandi is smiling at me for the last time.<br>
“_Mijita_, you’re getting so pretty, the boys will never leave you alone.”<br>
Her compliments are hand-me-downs you’re embarrassed to be seen in;<br>
you are astounded that I managed to grow here. But I am a rosebush<br>
from drought country, breathing chicken feather and snake guts,<br>
letting thorns teach me to love my own blood. I’ve been nourished<br>
by the crooked prayers that came before me, lifted by the lunatic cries<br>
of white doves and the fan-blade wings of cockroaches.<br>
There is one place in town to get a milkshake, and the exit signs<br>
are the only green for miles. This is how we learn to let love find us<br>
when it’s looking, how we soak it in like bread.
