* At *Yes Magazine*, [Jacqueline Keeler has written](http://www.yesmagazine.org/peace-justice/why-reading-sherman-alexie-was-never-enough-20180312) an excellent story that offers some background and some wider context into the [allegations surrounding Sherman Alexie](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2018/03/06/finding-my-way-through-the-troubling-sherman-alexie-stories/). The piece is titled "Why Reading Sherman Alexie Was Never Enough: As the #MeToo spotlight moves to Indian Country, epidemic violence against Native women meets tokenism in publishing," and it's absolutely worth your time.

* If, like me, you had never heard of Seattle-area sci-fi writer E Lily Yu before she was [named the winner of this year's Gar LaSalle Storyteller Award](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2017/12/04/meet-e-lily-yu-this-years-winner-of-the-gar-lasalle-storyteller-award/), you might want to [read her latest story at Clarkesworld magazine](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/yu_03_18/). She's definitely one of our most interesting up-and-coming talents.

<blockquote>All that autumn and winter she tended the flower. After the petals faded and fell, slender leaves speared up, glowing with life and green throughout the cold winter. She fed the flower her secrets, burying them one by one, and watered it with drops of her blood, red as the flower had been, because there was no death in the garden, and the flower, her grandmother had said, needed death to live.</blockquote>

* You might have nightmares if you [watch this video](https://splinternews.com/trump-supporters-caught-on-camera-threatening-to-burn-d-1823742598) of a Trump supporter who threatened to burn down a Berkeley bookstore. Those are two people who just want to destroy everything beautiful in their path. It's like staring into a vacuum.

* And if that story didn't give you nightmares, [this report about a fully automated bookstore in Beijing just might](http://www.thebeijinger.com/blog/2018/03/13/first-24-hour-staffless-bookstore-opens-beijing) do the trick.

<blockquote>The automated store even features a robot who is touted as a key feature of the store. Although she didn't find the store's prices to be competitive, customer Mrs. Zhang commended its automated worker, saying that "the interaction with the store's robot is something worth experiencing, especially for the children."</blockquote>
