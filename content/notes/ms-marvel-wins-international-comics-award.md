This weekend, G. Willow Wilson [took a public stand](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/30/g-willow-wilson-on-commercial-art-ethics-and-donald-trump/) against Marvel president Ike Perlmutter for donating $1 million to Donald Trump's weird pro-veteran charity thing. In her post on the controversy, Wilson made a joke about getting fired. 

The next day, Wilson picked up an honor that definitely makes the case for her continued employment. Her *Ms. Marvel* comic won the Best Series award at the Angouleme International Comics Festival. It's the first Marvel comic to ever win the award. This is not the best year for the Angouleme — they're [having a sexism problem](http://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2016/01/06/fantagraphics-author-withdraws-name-from-sexist-award-long-list/) — but they certainly made the right call with *Ms. Marvel*. Congratulations to Wilson, who certainly had a roller coaster of a weekend.
