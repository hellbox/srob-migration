It’s summer in Sanger, California,<br>
and there’s a volcano<br>
between my mother’s lips<br>
as she stuffs me<br>
into tiny shoes and a cotton dress.<br>
Ashes powder my pointy bits &mdash;<br>
nose, elbows, training bra.
 
Instead of running in grapevines,<br>
I sit in mahogany pews<br>
at a Methodist church and stare<br>
at the heavily blushed face<br>
of my grandmother &mdash;<br>
her gray head juts<br>
out her coffin<br>
like a matchstick from a box.
 
She used to force relish<br>
into tuna &mdash; I said<br>
I didn’t like it, she said<br>
I didn’t know<br>
how to brush my hair<br>
and even if I did<br>
it wouldn’t brush right.

I want to strike her face<br>
against flint<br>
and ash her body into a jar &mdash;<br>
cover the condolences of strangers<br>
_with I never liked Nona<br>
and she never liked me._
