Brazenhead Books in Manhattan has closed. Most of us never went there &mdash; it was an illegal store. Access, and the address, were shared amongst insiders. “The secret was known to a small number of discreet patrons and shared strictly by word of mouth,” says Brian Patrick Eha, in a [bittersweet New Yorker article](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/saying-goodbye-to-a-secret-bookstore?mbid=rss) about the store, and its owner Michael Seidenberg.

I love the romantic idea of these secret hidden places — so long as I’m on the inside, of course (sucks to _not_ know). But then the romance gives away to head scratching. Did Brazenhead take credit cards, or cash only? Did Seidenberg pay his taxes? How off-the-books was he, really? Did he have a business license? What about the assistant, mentioned in the article — were they paid under the table (he paid a fourteen year-old Jonathan Lethem in books for his work in a retail store)? The article conveniently skips the questions its very reporting begs. 

Small businesses are hard work. The regulations and hoops you have to jump through — especially in New York City — are tremendous, and probably unreasonable. Which turns my thoughts to the indie bookstores who _do_ jump through them to keep their doors open. At least they get some [nice illustrations](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/bookstores-of-new-york) from [time-to-time](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/endangered-bookstores-new-york).

Not so long ago, Ken Kalfus [lamented on these same storied (web)pages](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-book-buyers-lament): “Only a few of the city’s bookstores remain in business and they each need my patronage desperately.” I guess that goes for the secret illegal stores, as well as the ones anybody can walk into and browse to their hearts content.
