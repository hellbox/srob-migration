Sponsor Northwest Associated Arts is back this week to bring yet another great event to the attention of our readers. This time, it's a talk by **Anne Lamott, coming up on April 8, 2018, at Benaroya Hall**. It's sure to be packed, given how beloved Lamott is, and after her recent sold-out interview with Hillary Clinton at the Paramount Theater.

This will be a good evening for writers and readers both: for followers of Lamott's *Bird by Bird* writing guide (who are legion), and for lovers of her thoughtful, direct, and funny novels and essays. Start the year right by putting this on your calendar — you'll thank yourself later. Get more information [on our sponsor’s page](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsorships/), or buy tickets [here](https://www.seattlesymphony.org/concerttickets/calendar/2017-2018/benaroyahall/anne-lamott). 

We just realized that both Christmas and New Year's day here at the *Seattle Review of Books* were sponsored by Northwest Associated Arts. Thank you for the making our holidays bright, NWAA! And a huge thank-you to all of our 2017 sponsors. We're grateful for each and every one of you. 

If you're interested in joining our community of sponsors (who are, really, the best) — and putting your book or event in front of our readers — check out [available dates in 2018](http://www.seattlereviewofbooks.com/sponsor/book/). We'd love to meet you.
